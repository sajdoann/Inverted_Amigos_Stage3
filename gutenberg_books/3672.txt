AFGHANISTAN

@Afghanistan:Introduction

Background: Afghanistan was invaded and occupied by the Soviet Union
in 1979. The USSR was forced to withdraw 10 years later by
anti-communist mujahidin forces supplied and trained by the US, Saudi
Arabia, Pakistan, and others. Fighting subsequently continued among
the various mujahidin factions, but the fundamentalist Islamic Taliban
movement has been able to seize most of the country. In addition to
the continuing civil strife, the country suffers from enormous
poverty, a crumbling infrastructure, and widespread live mines.

@Afghanistan:Economy

Economy - overview: Afghanistan is an extremely poor, landlocked
country, highly dependent on farming and livestock raising (sheep and
goats). Economic considerations have played second fiddle to political
and military upheavals during two decades of war, including the nearly
10-year Soviet military occupation (which ended 15 February 1989).
During that conflict one-third of the population fled the country,
with Pakistan and Iran sheltering a combined peak of more than 6
million refugees. In early 1999, 1.2 million Afghan refugees remained
in Pakistan and about 1.4 million in Iran. Gross domestic product has
fallen substantially over the past 20 years because of the loss of
labor and capital and the disruption of trade and transport. The
majority of the population continues to suffer from insufficient food,
clothing, housing, and medical care. Inflation remains a serious
problem throughout the country. International aid can deal with only a
fraction of the humanitarian problem, let alone promote economic
development. The economic situation did not improve in 1998-99, as
internal civil strife continued, hampering both domestic economic
policies and international aid efforts. Numerical data are likely to
be either unavailable or unreliable. Afghanistan was by far the
largest producer of opium poppies in 1999, and narcotics trafficking
is a major source of revenue.

@Albania:Economy

Economy - overview: An extremely poor country by European standards,
Albania is making the difficult transition to a more open-market
economy. The economy rebounded in 1993-95 after a severe depression
accompanying the collapse of the previous centrally planned system in
1990 and 1991. However, a weakening of government resolve to maintain
stabilization policies in the election year of 1996 contributed to
renewal of inflationary pressures, spurred by the budget deficit which
exceeded 12%. The collapse of financial pyramid schemes in early 1997
- which had attracted deposits from a substantial portion of Albania's
population - triggered severe social unrest which led to more than
1,500 deaths, widespread destruction of property, and an 8% drop in
GDP. The new government, installed in July 1997, has taken strong
measures to restore public order and to revive economic activity and
trade. The economy continues to be bolstered by remittances of some
20% of the labor force that works abroad, mostly in Greece and Italy.
These remittances supplement GDP and help offset the large foreign
trade deficit. Most agricultural land was privatized in 1992,
substantially improving peasant incomes. In 1998, Albania recovered
the 8% drop in GDP of 1997 and pushed ahead by 7% in 1999.
International aid has helped defray the high costs of receiving and
returning refugees from the Kosovo conflict.

ALGERIA

@Algeria:Introduction

Background: After a century of rule by France, Algeria became
independent in 1962. The surprising first round success of the
fundamentalist FIS (Islamic Salvation Front) party in December 1991
balloting caused the army to intervene, crack down on the FIS, and
postpone the subsequent elections. The FIS response has resulted in a
continuous low-grade civil conflict with the secular state apparatus,
which nonetheless has allowed elections featuring pro-government and
moderate religious-based parties. FIS's armed wing, the Islamic
Salvation Army, dissolved itself in January 2000 and many armed
insurgents surrendered under an amnesty program designed to promote
national reconciliation. Nevertheless, some residual fighting
continues. Other concerns include large-scale unemployment and the
need to diversify the petroleum-based economy.

@Algeria:Economy

Economy - overview: The hydrocarbons sector is the backbone of the
economy, accounting for roughly 52% of budget revenues, 25% of GDP,
and over 95% of export earnings. Algeria has the fifth-largest
reserves of natural gas in the world and is the second largest gas
exporter; it ranks fourteenth for oil reserves. Algiers' efforts to
reform one of the most centrally planned economies in the Arab world
stalled in 1992 as the country became embroiled in political turmoil.
Burdened with a heavy foreign debt, Algiers concluded a one-year
standby arrangement with the IMF in April 1994 and the following year
signed onto a three-year extended fund facility which ended 30 April
1998. Some progress on economic reform, Paris Club debt reschedulings
in 1995 and 1996, and oil and gas sector expansion contributed to a
recovery in growth since 1995. Still, the economy remains heavily
dependent on volatile oil and gas revenues. The government has
continued efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and
domestic investment outside the energy sector, but has had little
success in reducing high unemployment and improving living standards.

AMERICAN SAMOA

@American Samoa:Introduction

Background: Settled as early as 1000 B. C., Samoa was "discovered" by
European explorers in the 18th century. International rivalries in the
latter half of the 19th century were settled by an 1899 treaty in
which Germany and the US divided the Samoan archipelago. The US
formally occupied its portion - a smaller group of eastern islands
with the excellent harbor of Pago Pago - the following year.

@American Samoa:Economy

Economy - overview: This is a traditional Polynesian economy in which
more than 90% of the land is communally owned. Economic activity is
strongly linked to the US, with which American Samoa conducts the
great bulk of its foreign trade. Tuna fishing and tuna processing
plants are the backbone of the private sector, with canned tuna the
primary export. Transfers from the US Government add substantially to
American Samoa's economic well-being. Attempts by the government to
develop a larger and broader economy are restrained by Samoa's remote
location, its limited transportation, and its devastating hurricanes.
Tourism, a developing sector, may be held back by the current
financial difficulties in East Asia.

@Andorra:Economy

Economy - overview: Tourism, the mainstay of Andorra's tiny,
well-to-do economy, accounts for roughly 80% of GDP. An estimated 9
million tourists visit annually, attracted by Andorra's duty-free
status and by its summer and winter resorts. Andorra's comparative
advantage has recently eroded as the economies of neighboring France
and Spain have been opened up, providing broader availability of goods
and lower tariffs. The banking sector, with its "tax haven" status,
also contributes substantially to the economy. Agricultural production
is limited by a scarcity of arable land, and most food has to be
imported. The principal livestock activity is sheep raising.
Manufacturing consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars, and furniture.
Andorra is a member of the EU Customs Union and is treated as an EU
member for trade in manufactured goods (no tariffs) and as a non-EU
member for agricultural products.

ANGOLA

@Angola:Introduction

Background: Civil war has been the norm in Angola since independence
from Portugal in 1975. A 1994 peace accord between the government and
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)
provided for the integration of former UNITA insurgents into the
government and armed forces. A national unity government was installed
in April of 1997, but serious fighting resumed in late 1998, rendering
hundreds of thousands of people homeless. Up to 1.5 million lives may
have been lost in fighting over the past quarter century.

@Angola:Economy

Economy - overview: Angola is an economy in disarray because of a
quarter century of nearly continuous warfare. Despite its abundant
natural resources, output per capita is among the world's lowest.
Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for 85% of the
population. Oil production and the supporting activities are vital to
the economy, contributing about 45% to GDP and 90% of exports.
Notwithstanding the signing of a peace accord in November 1994,
violence continues, millions of land mines remain, and many farmers
are reluctant to return to their fields. As a result, much of the
country's food must still be imported. To take advantage of its rich
resources - gold, diamonds, extensive forests, Atlantic fisheries, and
large oil deposits - Angola will need to implement the peace agreement
and reform government policies. Despite the increase in the pace of
civil warfare in late 1998, the economy grew by an estimated 4% in
1999. The government introduced new currency denominations in 1999,
including a 1 and 5 kwanza note. Expanded oil production brightens
prospects for 2000, but internal strife discourages investment outside
of the petroleum sector.

ANGUILLA

@Anguilla:Introduction

Background: Colonized by English settlers from Saint Kitts in 1650,
Anguilla was administered by Great Britain until the early 19th
century, when the island - against the wishes of the inhabitants - was
incorporated into a single British dependency along with Saint Kitts
and Nevis. Several attempts at separation failed. In 1971, two years
after a revolt, Anguilla was finally allowed to secede; this
arrangement was formally recognized in 1980 with Anguilla becoming a
separate British dependency.

@Anguilla:Economy

Economy - overview: Anguilla has few natural resources, and the
economy depends heavily on luxury tourism, offshore banking, lobster
fishing, and remittances from emigrants. The economy, and especially
the tourism sector, suffered a setback in late 1995 due to the effects
of Hurricane Luis in September but recovered in 1996. Increased
activity in the tourism industry, which has spurred the growth of the
construction sector, contributed to economic growth in 1997-98.
Anguillan officials have put substantial effort into developing the
offshore financing sector. A comprehensive package of financial
services legislation was enacted in late 1994. In the medium term,
prospects for the economy will depend on the tourism sector and,
therefore, on continuing income growth in the industrialized nations
as well as favorable weather conditions.

ANTARCTICA

@Antarctica:Geography

Location: continent mostly south of the Antarctic Circle

Geographic coordinates: 90 00 S, 0 00 E

Map references: Antarctic Region

Area:
total: 14 million sq km
land: 14 million sq km (280,000 sq km ice-free, 13.72 million sq km
ice-covered) (est.)
note: fifth-largest continent, following Asia, Africa, North America,
and South America, but larger than Australia and the subcontinent of
Europe

Area - comparative: slightly less than 1.5 times the size of the US

Land boundaries: 0 km
note: see entry on International disputes

Coastline: 17,968 km

Maritime claims: none, but see the Disputes - international entry

Climate: severe low temperatures vary with latitude, elevation, and
distance from the ocean; East Antarctica is colder than West
Antarctica because of its higher elevation; Antarctic Peninsula has
the most moderate climate; higher temperatures occur in January along
the coast and average slightly below freezing

Terrain: about 98% thick continental ice sheet and 2% barren rock,
with average elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters; mountain
ranges up to 5,140 meters; ice-free coastal areas include parts of
southern Victoria Land, Wilkes Land, the Antarctic Peninsula area, and
parts of Ross Island on McMurdo Sound; glaciers form ice shelves along
about half of the coastline, and floating ice shelves constitute 11%
of the area of the continent

Elevation extremes:
lowest point: Southern Ocean 0 m
highest point: Vinson Massif 5,140 m

Natural resources: none presently exploited; iron ore, chromium,
copper, gold, nickel, platinum and other minerals, and coal and
hydrocarbons have been found in small, uncommercial quantities

Land use:
arable land: 0%
permanent crops: 0%
permanent pastures: 0%
forests and woodland: 0%
other: 100% (ice 98%, barren rock 2%)

Irrigated land: 0 sq km (1993)

Natural hazards: katabatic (gravity-driven) winds blow coastward from
the high interior; frequent blizzards form near the foot of the
plateau; cyclonic storms form over the ocean and move clockwise along
the coast; volcanism on Deception Island and isolated areas of West
Antarctica; other seismic activity rare and weak

Environment - current issues: in 1998, NASA satellite data showed that
the antarctic ozone hole was the largest on record, covering 27
million square kilometers; researchers in 1997 found that increased
ultraviolet light coming through the hole damages the DNA of icefish,
an antarctic fish lacking hemoglobin; ozone depletion earlier was
shown to harm one-celled antarctic marine plants

Geography - note: the coldest, windiest, highest (on average), and
driest continent; during summer, more solar radiation reaches the
surface at the South Pole than is received at the Equator in an
equivalent period; mostly uninhabitable

observation, to any area and may inspect all stations, installations,
and equipment; advance notice of all activities and of the
introduction of military personnel must be given; Article 8 - allows
for jurisdiction over observers and scientists by their own states;
Article 9 - frequent consultative meetings take place among member
nations; Article 10 - treaty states will discourage activities by any
country in Antarctica that are contrary to the treaty; Article 11 -
disputes to be settled peacefully by the parties concerned or,
ultimately, by the ICJ; Articles 12, 13, 14 - deal with upholding,
interpreting, and amending the treaty among involved nations. Other
agreements - some 200 recommendations adopted at treaty consultative
meetings and ratified by governments include - Agreed Measures for the
Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora (1964); Convention for the
Conservation of Antarctic Seals (1972); Convention on the Conservation
of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (1980); a mineral resources
agreement was signed in 1988 but was subsequently rejected; the
Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty was
signed 4 October 1991 and entered into force 14 January 1998; this
agreement provides for the protection of the Antarctic environment
through five specific annexes on marine pollution, fauna, and flora,
environmental impact assessments, waste management, and protected
areas; it prohibits all activities relating to mineral resources
except scientific research.

Legal system: US law, including certain criminal offenses by or
against US nationals, such as murder, may apply to areas not under
jurisdiction of other countries. Some US laws directly apply to
Antarctica. For example, the Antarctic Conservation Act, 16 U.S.C.
section 2401 et seq., provides civil and criminal penalties for the
following activities, unless authorized by regulation of statute: the
taking of native mammals or birds; the introduction of nonindigenous
plants and animals; entry into specially protected or scientific
areas; the discharge or disposal of pollutants; and the importation
into the US of certain items from Antarctica. Violation of the
Antarctic Conservation Act carries penalties of up to $10,000 in fines
and one year in prison. The Departments of Treasury, Commerce,
Transportation, and Interior share enforcement responsibilities.
Public Law 95-541, the US Antarctic Conservation Act of 1978, requires
expeditions from the US to Antarctica to notify, in advance, the
Office of Oceans and Polar Affairs, Room 5801, Department of State,
Washington, DC 20520, which reports such plans to other nations as
required by the Antarctic Treaty. For more information, contact Permit
Office, Office of Polar Programs, National Science Foundation,

@Antarctica:Economy

Economy - overview: No economic activity is conducted at present,
except for fishing off the coast and small-scale tourism, both based
abroad. Antarctic fisheries in 1998-99 (1 July-30 June) reported
landing 119,898 metric tons. Unregulated fishing landed five to six
times more than the regulated fishery, and allegedly illegal fishing
in antarctic waters in 1998 resulted in the seizure (by France and
Australia) of at least eight fishing ships. A total of 10,013 tourists
visited in the 1998-99 summer, up from the 9,604 who visited the
previous year. Nearly all of them were passengers on 16 commercial
(nongovernmental) ships and several yachts that made 116 trips during
the summer. Most tourist trips lasted approximately two weeks.

@Antigua and Barbuda:Economy

Economy - overview: Tourism continues to be the dominant activity in
the economy accounting directly or indirectly for more than half of
GDP. In 1999 the budding offshore financial sector was seriously hurt
by financial sanctions imposed by the US and UK as a result of the
loosening of its money-laundering controls. The government has made
efforts to comply with international demands in order to get the
sanctions lifted. The dual island nation's agricultural production is
mainly directed to the domestic market; the sector is constrained by
the limited water supply and labor shortages that reflect the pull of
higher wages in tourism and construction. Manufacturing comprises
enclave-type assembly for export with major products being bedding,
handicrafts, and electronic components. Prospects for economic growth
in the medium term will continue to depend on income growth in the
industrialized world, especially in the US, which accounts for about
one-third of all tourist arrivals.

ARCTIC OCEAN

@Arctic Ocean:Introduction

Background: A spring 2000 decision by the International Hydrographic
Organization delimited a fifth world ocean from the southern portions
of the Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, and Pacific Ocean. The new ocean
extends from the coast of Antarctica north to 60 degrees south
latitude which coincides with the Antarctic Treaty Limit. The Arctic
Ocean remains the smallest of the world's five oceans (after the
Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, and Southern Ocean).

@Arctic Ocean:Geography

Location: body of water mostly north of the Arctic Circle

Geographic coordinates: 90 00 N, 0 00 E

Map references: Arctic Region

Area:
total: 14.056 million sq km
note: includes Baffin Bay, Barents Sea, Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea,
East Siberian Sea, Greenland Sea, Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Kara Sea,
Laptev Sea, Northwest Passage, and other tributary water bodies

Area - comparative: slightly less than 1.5 times the size of the US

Coastline: 45,389 km

Climate: polar climate characterized by persistent cold and relatively
narrow annual temperature ranges; winters characterized by continuous
darkness, cold and stable weather conditions, and clear skies; summers
characterized by continuous daylight, damp and foggy weather, and weak
cyclones with rain or snow

Terrain: central surface covered by a perennial drifting polar icepack
that averages about 3 meters in thickness, although pressure ridges
may be three times that size; clockwise drift pattern in the Beaufort
Gyral Stream, but nearly straight-line movement from the New Siberian
Islands (Russia) to Denmark Strait (between Greenland and Iceland);
the icepack is surrounded by open seas during the summer, but more
than doubles in size during the winter and extends to the encircling
landmasses; the ocean floor is about 50% continental shelf (highest
percentage of any ocean) with the remainder a central basin
interrupted by three submarine ridges (Alpha Cordillera, Nansen
Cordillera, and Lomonosov Ridge)

Elevation extremes:
lowest point: Fram Basin -4,665 m
highest point: sea level 0 m

Natural resources: sand and gravel aggregates, placer deposits,
polymetallic nodules, oil and gas fields, fish, marine mammals (seals
and whales)

Natural hazards: ice islands occasionally break away from northern
Ellesmere Island; icebergs calved from glaciers in western Greenland
and extreme northeastern Canada; permafrost in islands; virtually ice
locked from October to June; ships subject to superstructure icing
from October to May

Environment - current issues: endangered marine species include
walruses and whales; fragile ecosystem slow to change and slow to
recover from disruptions or damage; thinning polar icepack

Geography - note: major chokepoint is the southern Chukchi Sea
(northern access to the Pacific Ocean via the Bering Strait);
strategic location between North America and Russia; shortest marine
link between the extremes of eastern and western Russia; floating
research stations operated by the US and Russia; maximum snow cover in
March or April about 20 to 50 centimeters over the frozen ocean; snow
cover lasts about 10 months

@Arctic Ocean:Government

Data code: none; the US Government has not approved a standard for
hydrographic codes - see the Cross-Reference List of Hydrographic Data
Codes appendix

@Arctic Ocean:Economy

Economy - overview: Economic activity is limited to the exploitation
of natural resources, including petroleum, natural gas, fish, and
seals.

@Arctic Ocean:Transportation

Ports and harbors: Churchill (Canada), Murmansk (Russia), Prudhoe Bay
(US)

Transportation - note: sparse network of air, ocean, river, and land
routes; the Northwest Passage (North America) and Northern Sea Route
(Eurasia) are important seasonal waterways

@Arctic Ocean:Transnational Issues

Disputes - international: some maritime disputes (see littoral
states); Svalbard is the focus of a maritime boundary dispute between
Norway and Russia

@Argentina:Economy

Economy - overview: Argentina benefits from rich natural resources, a
highly literate population, an export-oriented agricultural sector,
and a diversified industrial base. However, when President Carlos
MENEM took office in 1989, the country had piled up huge external
debts, inflation had reached 200% per month, and output was
plummeting. To combat the economic crisis, the government embarked on
a path of trade liberalization, deregulation, and privatization. In
1991, it implemented radical monetary reforms which pegged the peso to
the US dollar and limited the growth in the monetary base by law to
the growth in reserves. Inflation fell sharply in subsequent years. In
1995, the Mexican peso crisis produced capital flight, the loss of
banking system deposits, and a severe, but short-lived, recession; a
series of reforms to bolster the domestic banking system followed.
Real GDP growth recovered strongly, reaching 8% in 1997. In 1998,
international financial turmoil caused by Russia's problems and
increasing investor anxiety over Brazil produced the highest domestic
interest rates in more than three years, halving the growth rate of
the economy. Conditions worsened in 1999 with GDP falling by 3%.
President Fernando DE LA RUA, who took office in December 1999,
sponsored tax increases and spending cuts to reduce the deficit, which
had ballooned to 2.5% of GDP in 1999. The new government also arranged
a new $7.4 billion stand-by facility with the IMF for contingency
purposes - almost three times the size of the previous arrangement.
Key challenges facing the new government include reforming the
country's rigid labor code and addressing the precarious financial
situation of several highly indebted provinces.

ARMENIA

@Armenia:Introduction

Background: An Orthodox Christian country, Armenia was incorporated
into Russia in 1828 and the USSR in 1920. Armenian leaders remain
preoccupied by the long conflict with Azerbaijan over
Nagorno-Karabakh, a primarily Armenian-populated exclave, assigned to
Soviet Azerbaijan in the 1920s by Moscow. Armenia and Azerbaijan began
fighting over the exclave in 1988; the struggle escalated after both
countries attained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. By May
1994, when a cease-fire took hold, Armenian forces held not only
Nagorno-Karabakh but also a significant portion of Azerbaijan proper.
The economies of both sides have been hurt by their inability to make
substantial progress toward a peaceful resolution.

@Armenia:Economy

Economy - overview: Under the old Soviet central planning system,
Armenia had developed a modern industrial sector, supplying machine
tools, textiles, and other manufactured goods to sister republics in
exchange for raw materials and energy. Since the implosion of the USSR
in December 1991, Armenia has switched to small-scale agriculture away
from the large agroindustrial complexes of the Soviet era. The
agricultural sector has long-term needs for more investment and
updated technology. The privatization of industry has been at a slower
pace, but has been given renewed emphasis by the current
administration. Armenia is a food importer, and its mineral deposits
(gold, bauxite) are small. The ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan over
the ethnic Armenian-dominated region of Nagorno-Karabakh and the
breakup of the centrally directed economic system of the former Soviet
Union contributed to a severe economic decline in the early 1990s. By
1994, however, the Armenian Government had launched an ambitious
IMF-sponsored economic program that has resulted in positive growth
rates in 1995-99. Armenia also managed to slash inflation and to
privatize most small- and medium-sized enterprises. The chronic energy
shortages Armenia suffered in recent years have been largely offset by
the energy supplied by one of its nuclear power plants at Metsamor.
Continued Russian financial difficulties have hurt the trade sector
especially, but have been offset by international aid, domestic
restructuring, and foreign direct investment.

@Aruba:Economy

Economy - overview: Tourism is the mainstay of the Aruban economy,
although offshore banking and oil refining and storage are also
important. The rapid growth of the tourism sector over the last decade
has resulted in a substantial expansion of other activities.
Construction has boomed, with hotel capacity five times the 1985
level. In addition, the reopening of the country's oil refinery in
1993, a major source of employment and foreign exchange earnings, has
further spurred growth. Aruba's small labor force and less than 1%
unemployment rate have led to a large number of unfilled job
vacancies, despite sharp rises in wage rates in recent years.

ATLANTIC OCEAN

@Atlantic Ocean:Introduction

Background: A spring 2000 decision by the International Hydrographic
Organization delimited a fifth world ocean from the southern portions
of the Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, and Pacific Ocean. The new ocean
extends from the coast of Antarctica north to 60 degrees south
latitude which coincides with the Antarctic Treaty Limit. The Atlantic
Ocean remains the second-largest of the world's five oceans (after the
Pacific Ocean, but larger than the Indian Ocean, Southern Ocean, and
Arctic Ocean).

@Atlantic Ocean:Geography

Location: body of water between Africa, Europe, the Southern Ocean,
and the Western Hemisphere

Geographic coordinates: 0 00 N, 25 00 W

Map references: World

Area:
total: 76.762 million sq km
note: includes Baltic Sea, Black Sea, Caribbean Sea, Davis Strait,
Denmark Strait, part of the Drake Passage, Gulf of Mexico,
Mediterranean Sea, North Sea, Norwegian Sea, almost all of the Scotia
Sea, and other tributary water bodies

Area - comparative: slightly less than 6.5 times the size of the US

Coastline: 111,866 km

Climate: tropical cyclones (hurricanes) develop off the coast of
Africa near Cape Verde and move westward into the Caribbean Sea;
hurricanes can occur from May to December, but are most frequent from
August to November

Terrain: surface usually covered with sea ice in Labrador Sea, Denmark
Strait, and Baltic Sea from October to June; clockwise warm-water gyre
(broad, circular system of currents) in the northern Atlantic,
counterclockwise warm-water gyre in the southern Atlantic; the ocean
floor is dominated by the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a rugged north-south
centerline for the entire Atlantic basin

Elevation extremes:
lowest point: Milwaukee Deep in the Puerto Rico Trench -8,605 m
highest point: sea level 0 m

Natural resources: oil and gas fields, fish, marine mammals (seals and
whales), sand and gravel aggregates, placer deposits, polymetallic
nodules, precious stones

Natural hazards: icebergs common in Davis Strait, Denmark Strait, and
the northwestern Atlantic Ocean from February to August and have been
spotted as far south as Bermuda and the Madeira Islands; ships subject
to superstructure icing in extreme northern Atlantic from October to
May; persistent fog can be a maritime hazard from May to September;
hurricanes (May to December)

Environment - current issues: endangered marine species include the
manatee, seals, sea lions, turtles, and whales; drift net fishing is
hastening the decline of fish stocks and contributing to international
disputes; municipal sludge pollution off eastern US, southern Brazil,
and eastern Argentina; oil pollution in Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico,
Lake Maracaibo, Mediterranean Sea, and North Sea; industrial waste and
municipal sewage pollution in Baltic Sea, North Sea, and Mediterranean
Sea

Geography - note: major chokepoints include the Dardanelles, Strait of
Gibraltar, access to the Panama and Suez Canals; strategic straits
include the Strait of Dover, Straits of Florida, Mona Passage, The
Sound (Oresund), and Windward Passage; the Equator divides the
Atlantic Ocean into the North Atlantic Ocean and South Atlantic Ocean

AUSTRALIA

@Australia:Introduction

Background: Australia became a commonwealth of the British Empire in
1901. It was able to take advantage of its natural resources to
rapidly develop its agricultural and manufacturing industries and to
make a major contribution to the British effort in World Wars I and
II. Long-term concerns include pollution, particularly depletion of
the ozone layer, and management and conservation of coastal areas,
especially the Great Barrier Reef. A referendum to change Australia's
status, from a commonwealth headed by the British monarch to an
independent republic, was defeated in 1999.

@Australia:Economy

Economy - overview: Australia has a prosperous Western-style
capitalist economy, with a per capita GDP at the level of the four
dominant West European economies. Rich in natural resources, Australia
is a major exporter of agricultural products, minerals, metals, and
fossil fuels. Commodities account for 57% of the value of total
exports, so that a downturn in world commodity prices can have a big
impact on the economy. The government is pushing for increased exports
of manufactured goods, but competition in international markets
continues to be severe. While Australia has suffered from the low
growth and high unemployment characterizing the OECD countries in the
early 1990s and during the recent financial problems in East Asia, the
economy has expanded at a solid 4% annual growth pace in the last five
years. Canberra's emphasis on reforms is a key factor behind the
economy's resilience to the regional crisis and its stronger than
expected growth rate. Growth in 2000 will depend on key international
commodity prices, the extent of recovery in nearby Asian economies,
and the strength of US and European markets.

AUSTRIA

@Austria:Introduction

Background: Once the center of power for the large Austro-Hungarian
Empire, Austria was reduced to a small republic after its defeat in
World War I. Following annexation by Nazi Germany in 1938 and
subsequent occupation by the victorious Allies, Austria's 1955 State
Treaty declared the country "permanently neutral" as a condition of
Soviet military withdrawal. Neutrality, once ingrained as part of the
Austrian cultural identity, has been called into question since the
Soviet collapse and Austria's increasingly prominent role in European
affairs. A prosperous country, Austria joined the European Union in
1995 and the euro monetary system in 1999.

@Austria:Economy

Economy - overview: Austria with its well-developed market economy and
high standard of living is closely tied to other EU economies,
especially Germany's. Membership in the EU has drawn an influx of
foreign investors attracted by Austria's access to the single European
market. Through privatization efforts, the 1996-98 budget
consolidation programs, and austerity measures, Austria has brought
its total public sector deficit down to 2.1% of GDP in 1999 and public
debt - at 63.1% of GDP in 1998 - more or less in line with the 60% of
GDP required by the EMU's Maastricht criteria. Cuts mainly have
affected the civil service and Austria's generous social benefit
system, the two major causes of the government's deficit. To meet
increased competition from both EU and Central European countries,
Austria will need to emphasize knowledge-based sectors of the economy
and deregulate the service sector. Growth, which slowed to 2.0% in
1999, probably will rebound to 2.8% in both 2000 and 2001.

AZERBAIJAN

@Azerbaijan:Introduction

Background: Azerbaijan - a nation of Turkic Muslims - has been an
independent republic since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Despite a cease-fire, in place since 1994, Azerbaijan has yet to
resolve its conflict with Armenia over the Azerbaijani
Nagorno-Karabakh enclave (largely Armenian populated). Azerbaijan has
lost almost 20% of its territory and must support some 750,000
refugees as a result of the conflict. Corruption is ubiquitous and the
promise of wealth from Azerbaijan's undeveloped petroleum resources
remains largely unfulfilled.

levels of the Caspian Sea

Environment - current issues: local scientists consider the Abseron
Yasaqligi (Apsheron Peninsula) (including Baku and Sumqayit) and the
Caspian Sea to be the ecologically most devastated area in the world
because of severe air, water, and soil pollution; soil pollution
results from the use of DDT as a pesticide and also from toxic

@Azerbaijan:Economy

Economy - overview: Azerbaijan is less developed industrially than
either Armenia or Georgia, the other Caucasian states. It resembles
the Central Asian states in its majority Muslim population, high
structural unemployment, and low standard of living. The economy's
most prominent products are oil, cotton, and natural gas. Production
from the Caspian oil field declined through 1997 but registered an
increase in 1998-99. Negotiation of 19 production-sharing arrangements
(PSAs) with foreign firms, which have thus far committed $60 billion
to oil field development, should generate the funds needed to spur
future industrial development. Oil production under the first of these
PSAs, with the Azerbaijan International Operating Company, began in
November 1997. Azerbaijan shares all the formidable problems of the
former Soviet republics in making the transition from a command to a
market economy, but its considerable energy resources brighten its
long-term prospects. Baku has only recently begun making progress on
economic reform, and old economic ties and structures are slowly being
replaced. An obstacle to economic progress, including stepped up
foreign investment, is the continuing conflict with Armenia over the
Nagorno-Karabakh region. Trade with Russia and the other former Soviet
republics is declining in importance while trade is building up with
Turkey, Iran, UAE, and the nations of Europe. Growth in 2000 should
match growth in 1999. Long-term prospects will depend on world oil
prices and the location of new pipelines in the region.

BAHRAIN

@Bahrain:Introduction

Background: Bahrain's small size and central location among Persian
Gulf countries require it to play a delicate balancing act in foreign
affairs among its larger neighbors. Possessing minimal oil reserves,

@Bahrain:Economy

Economy - overview: In Bahrain, petroleum production and processing
account for about 60% of export receipts, 60% of government revenues,
and 30% of GDP. Economic conditions have fluctuated with the changing
fortunes of oil since 1985, for example, during and following the Gulf
crisis of 1990-91. With its highly developed communication and
transport facilities, Bahrain is home to numerous multinational firms
with business in the Gulf. A large share of exports consists of
petroleum products made from imported crude. Construction proceeds on
several major industrial projects. Unemployment, especially among the
young, and the depletion of both oil and underground water resources
are major long-term economic problems.

@Bangladesh:Economy

Economy - overview: Despite sustained domestic and international
efforts to improve economic and demographic prospects, Bangladesh
remains one of the world's poorest, most densely populated, and least
developed nations. The economy is largely agricultural, with the
cultivation of rice the single most important activity in the economy.
Major impediments to growth include frequent cyclones and floods, the
inefficiency of state-owned enterprises, a rapidly growing labor force
that cannot be absorbed by agriculture, delays in exploiting energy
resources (natural gas), inadequate power supplies, and slow
implementation of economic reforms. Prime Minister Sheikh HASINA
Wajed's Awami League government has made some headway improving the
climate for foreign investors and liberalizing the capital markets;
for example, it has negotiated with foreign firms for oil and gas
exploration, better countrywide distribution of cooking gas, and the
construction of natural gas pipelines and power plants. Progress on
other economic reforms has been halting because of opposition from the
bureaucracy, public sector unions, and other vested interest groups.
The especially severe floods of 1998 increased the country's reliance
on large-scale international aid. So far the East Asian financial
crisis has not had major impact on the economy.

finance and informatics are important foreign exchange earners, and
there is also a light manufacturing sector. The government continues
its efforts to reduce the unacceptably high unemployment rate,
encourage direct foreign investment, and privatize remaining
state-owned enterprises.

@Belarus:Economy

Economy - overview: Belarus has seen little structural reform since
1995, when President LUKASHENKO launched the country on the path of
"market socialism." In keeping with this policy, LUKASHENKO re-imposed
administrative controls over prices and currency exchange rates and
expanded the state's right to intervene in the management of private
enterprise. In addition to the burdens imposed by high inflation,
businesses have been subject to pressure on the part of central and
local governments, e.g., arbitrary changes in regulations, numerous
rigorous inspections, and retroactive application of new business
regulations prohibiting practices that had been legal. Further
economic problems are two consecutive bad harvests, 1998-99, and
persistent trade deficits. Close relations with Russia, possibly
leading to reunion, color the pattern of economic developments. For
the time being, Belarus remains self-isolated from the West and its
open-market economies.

@Belgium:Introduction

Background: Belgium became independent from the Netherlands in 1830
and was occupied by Germany during World Wars I and II. It has
prospered in the past half century as a modern, technologically
advanced European state and member of NATO and the EU. Tensions
between the Dutch-speaking Flemings of the north and the
French-speaking Walloons of the south have led in recent years to
constitutional amendments granting these regions formal recognition
and autonomy.

@Belgium:Economy

Economy - overview: This modern private enterprise economy has
capitalized on its central geographic location, highly developed
transport network, and diversified industrial and commercial base.
Industry is concentrated mainly in the populous Flemish area in the
north, although the government is encouraging investment in the
southern region of Wallonia. With few natural resources, Belgium must
import substantial quantities of raw materials and export a large
volume of manufactures, making its economy unusually dependent on the
state of world markets. About three-quarters of its trade is with
other EU countries. Belgium's public debt fell from 127% of GDP in
1996 to 122% of GDP in 1998 and the government is trying to control
its expenditures to bring the figure more into line with other
industrialized countries. Belgium became a charter member of the
European Monetary Union (EMU) in January 1999. The dioxin crisis -
beginning in June 1999 with the discovery of a cancer-causing
substance in animal feed - constituted a serious blow to the
food-processing industry, both domestically and internationally. This
crisis slowed down GDP growth with recovery expected in the year 2000.

@Belize:Economy

Economy - overview: The small, essentially private enterprise economy
is based primarily on agriculture, agro-based industry, and
merchandising, with tourism and construction assuming greater
importance. Sugar, the chief crop, accounts for nearly half of
exports, while the banana industry is the country's largest employer.
The government's tough austerity program in 1997 resulted in an
economic slowdown that continued in 1998. The trade deficit has been
growing, mostly as a result of low export prices for sugar and
bananas. The new government faces important challenges to economic
stability. Rapid action to improve tax collection has been promised,
but a lack of progress in reining in spending could bring the exchange
rate under pressure. The tourist and construction sectors strengthened
in early 1999, leading to a preliminary estimate of revived growth at
4%.

@Benin:Economy

Economy - overview: The economy of Benin remains underdeveloped and
dependent on subsistence agriculture, cotton production, and regional
trade. Growth in real output has averaged a sound 4% in 1990-95 and 5%
in 1996-99. Rapid population growth has offset much of this growth in
output. Inflation has subsided over the past three years. Commercial
and transport activities, which make up a large part of GDP, are
vulnerable to developments in Nigeria, particularly fuel shortages.
The Paris Club and bilateral creditors have eased the external debt
situation in recent years. The government, still burdened with
money-losing state enterprises and a bloated civil service, has been
gradually implementing a structural adjustment program since 1991.

@Bermuda:Economy

Economy - overview: Bermuda enjoys one of the highest per capita
incomes in the world, having successfully exploited its location by
providing financial services for international firms and luxury
tourist facilities for 360,000 visitors annually. The tourist
industry, which accounts for an estimated 28% of GDP, attracts 84% of
its business from North America. The industrial sector is small, and
agriculture is severely limited by a lack of suitable land. About 80%
of food needs are imported. International business contributes over
60% of Bermuda's economic output; a failed independence vote in late
1995 can be partially attributed to Bermudian fears of scaring away
foreign firms. Government economic priorities are the further
strengthening of the tourist and international financial sectors.

@Bhutan:Economy

Economy - overview: The economy, one of the world's smallest and least
developed, is based on agriculture and forestry, which provide the
main livelihood for 90% of the population and account for about 40% of
GDP. Agriculture consists largely of subsistence farming and animal
husbandry. Rugged mountains dominate the terrain and make the building
of roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive. The economy
is closely aligned with India's through strong trade and monetary
links. The industrial sector is technologically backward, with most
production of the cottage industry type. Most development projects,
such as road construction, rely on Indian migrant labor. Bhutan's
hydropower potential and its attraction for tourists are key
resources. The Bhutanese Government has made some progress in
expanding the nation's productive base and improving social welfare.
Model education, social, and environment programs in Bhutan are
underway with support from multilateral development organizations.
Each economic program takes into account the government's desire to
protect the country's environment and cultural traditions. Detailed
controls and uncertain policies in areas like industrial licensing,
trade, labor, and finance continue to hamper foreign investment.

Background: Bolivia, named after independence fighter Simon BOLIVAR,
broke away from Spanish rule in 1825; much of its subsequent history
has consisted of a series of nearly 200 coups and counter-coups.

@Bolivia:Economy

Economy - overview: Bolivia, long one of the poorest and least
developed Latin American countries, has made considerable progress
toward the development of a market-oriented economy. Successes under
President SANCHEZ DE LOZADA (1993-1997) included the signing of a free
trade agreement with Mexico and the Southern Cone Common Market
(Mercosur) as well as the privatization of the state airline,
telephone company, railroad, electric power company, and oil company.
His successor, Hugo BANZER Suarez has tried to further improve the
country's investment climate with an anticorruption campaign. Growth
slowed in 1999, in part due to tight government budget policies, which
limited needed appropriations for anti-poverty programs, and the
fallout from the Asian financial crisis. Growth should rebound to
perhaps 4% in 2000 given reasonably favorable world commodity prices.

BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA

@Bosnia and Herzegovina:Introduction

Background: Bosnia and Herzegovina's declaration of sovereignty in
October of 1991, was followed by a referendum for independence from
the former Yugoslavia in February of 1992. The Bosnian Serbs -
supported by neighboring Serbia - responded with armed resistance
aimed at partitioning the republic along ethnic lines and joining
Serb-held areas to form a "greater Serbia." In March 1994, Bosnia's
Bosniaks and Croats reduced the number of warring factions from three
to two by signing an agreement creating a joint Bosniak/Croat
Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. On 21 November 1995, in Dayton,
Ohio, the warring parties signed a peace agreement that brought to a
halt the three years of interethnic civil strife (the final agreement
was signed in Paris on 14 December 1995). The Dayton Agreement divides
Bosnia and Herzegovina roughly equally between the Federation of
Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Bosnian Serb Republika Srpska. In
1995-96, a NATO-led international peacekeeping force (IFOR) of 60,000
troops served in Bosnia to implement and monitor the military aspects
of the agreement. IFOR was succeeded by a smaller, NATO-led
Stabilization Force (SFOR) whose mission is to deter renewed
hostilities. SFOR remains in place, with troop levels to be reduced to
about 19,000 by spring 2000.

Government - note: The Dayton Agreement, signed in Paris on 14
December 1995, retained Bosnia's exterior border and created a joint
multi-ethnic and democratic government. This national government -
based on proportional representation similar to that which existed in
the former socialist regime - is charged with conducting foreign,
economic, and fiscal policy. The Dayton Agreement also recognized a
second tier of government, comprised of two entities - a joint
Bosniak/Croat Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Bosnian
Serb Republika Srpska (RS) - each presiding over roughly one-half the
territory. The Federation and RS governments are charged with
overseeing internal functions. The Dayton Agreement established the
Office of the High Representative (OHR) to oversee the implementation
of the civilian aspects of the agreement. About 250 international and
450 local staff members are employed by the OHR.

@Bosnia and Herzegovina:Economy

Economy - overview: Bosnia and Herzegovina ranked next to The Former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as the poorest republic in the old
Yugoslav federation. Although agriculture has been almost all in
private hands, farms have been small and inefficient, and the republic
traditionally has been a net importer of food. Industry has been
greatly overstaffed, one reflection of the socialist economic
structure of Yugoslavia. TITO had pushed the development of military
industries in the republic with the result that Bosnia hosted a large
share of Yugoslavia's defense plants. The bitter interethnic warfare
in Bosnia caused production to plummet by 80% from 1990 to 1995,
unemployment to soar, and human misery to multiply. With an uneasy
peace in place, output recovered in 1996-98 at high percentage rates
on a low base; but output growth slowed appreciably in 1999, and GDP
remains far below the 1990 level. Economic data are of limited use
because, although both entities issue figures, national-level
statistics are not available. Moreover, official data do not capture
the large share of activity that occurs on the black market. In 1999,
the convertible mark - the national currency introduced in 1998 -
gained wider acceptance, and the Central Bank of Bosnia and
Herzegovina dramatically increased its reserve holdings.
Implementation of privatization, however, faltered in both areas.
Banking reform is also lagging. The country receives substantial
amounts of reconstruction assistance and humanitarian aid from the
international community but will have to prepare for an era of
declining assistance.

@Botswana:Economy

Economy - overview: Agriculture still provides a livelihood for more
than 80% of the population but supplies only about 50% of food needs
and accounts for only 3% of GDP. Subsistence farming and cattle
raising predominate. The sector is plagued by erratic rainfall and
poor soils. Diamond mining and tourism also are important to the
economy. Substantial mineral deposits were found in the 1970s and the
mining sector grew from 25% of GDP in 1980 to 38% in 1998.
Unemployment officially is 21% but unofficial estimates place it
closer to 40%. The Orapa 2000 project, which will double the capacity
of the country's main diamond mine, will be finished in early 2000.
This will be the main force behind continued economic expansion.

BRAZIL

@Brazil:Introduction

Background: Following three centuries under the rule of Portugal,
Brazil became an independent nation in 1822. By far the largest and
most populous country in South America, Brazil has overcome more than
half a century of military intervention in the governance of the
country to pursue industrial and agricultural growth and development
of the interior. Exploiting vast natural resources and a large labor
pool, Brazil became Latin America's leading economic power by the
1970s. Highly unequal income distribution remains a pressing problem.

Environment - current issues: deforestation in Amazon Basin destroys
the habitat and endangers the existence of a multitude of plant and
animal species indigenous to the area; air and water pollution in Rio
de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, and several other large cities; land
degradation and water pollution caused by improper mining activities
note: President CARDOSO in September 1999 signed into force an
environmental crime bill which for the first time defines pollution
and deforestation as crimes punishable by stiff fines and jail
sentences

@Brazil:People

Population: 172,860,370
note: Brazil took an intercensal count in August 1996 which reported a
population of 157,079,573; that figure was about 5% lower than
projections by the US Census Bureau, which is close to the implied
underenumeration of 4.6% for the 1991 census; estimates for this
country explicitly take into account the effects of excess mortality
due to AIDS; this can result in lower life expectancy, higher infant
mortality and death rates, lower population and growth rates, and
changes in the distribution of population by age and sex than would

@Brazil:Economy

Economy - overview: Possessing large and well-developed agricultural,
mining, manufacturing, and service sectors, Brazil's economy outweighs
that of all other South American countries and is expanding its
presence in world markets. In the late eighties and early nineties,
high inflation hindered economic activity and investment. The Real
Plan, instituted in the spring of 1994, sought to break inflationary
expectations by pegging the real to the US dollar. Inflation was
brought down to single digit annual figures, but not fast enough to
avoid substantial real exchange rate appreciation during the
transition phase of the Real Plan. This appreciation meant that
Brazilian goods were now more expensive relative to goods from other
countries, which contributed to large current account deficits.
However, no shortage of foreign currency ensued because of the
financial community's renewed interest in Brazilian markets as
inflation rates stabilized and the debt crisis of the eighties faded
from memory. The maintenance of large current account deficits via
capital account surpluses became problematic as investors became more
risk averse to emerging market exposure as a consequence of the Asian
financial crisis in 1997 and the Russian bond default in August 1998.
After crafting a fiscal adjustment program and pledging progress on
structural reform, Brazil received a $41.5 billion IMF-led
international support program in November 1998. In January 1999, the
Brazilian Central Bank announced that the real would no longer be
pegged to the US dollar. This devaluation helped moderate the downturn
in economic growth in 1999 that investors had expressed concerns about
over the summer of 1998. Brazil's debt to GDP ratio of 48% for 1999
beat the IMF target and helped reassure investors that Brazil will
maintain tight fiscal and monetary policy even with a floating
currency. The economy is expected to push growth up to 3% in 2000.

@British Virgin Islands:Economy

Economy - overview: The economy, one of the most prosperous in the
Caribbean, is highly dependent on tourism, which generates an
estimated 45% of the national income. An estimated 350,000 tourists,
mainly from the US, visited the islands in 1997. In the mid-1980s, the
government began offering offshore registration to companies wishing
to incorporate in the islands, and incorporation fees now generate
substantial revenues. An estimated 250,000 companies were on the
offshore registry by yearend 1997. The adoption of a comprehensive
insurance law in late 1994, which provides a blanket of
confidentiality with regulated statutory gateways for investigation of
criminal offenses, is expected to make the British Virgin Islands even
more attractive to international business. Livestock raising is the
most important agricultural activity; poor soils limit the islands'
ability to meet domestic food requirements. Because of traditionally
close links with the US Virgin Islands, the British Virgin Islands has
used the dollar as its currency since 1959.

@Brunei:Economy

Economy - overview: This small, wealthy economy is a mixture of
foreign and domestic entrepreneurship, government regulation and
welfare measures, and village tradition. It is almost totally
supported by exports of crude oil and natural gas, with revenues from
the petroleum sector accounting for over half of GDP. Per capita GDP
is far above most other Third World countries, and substantial income
from overseas investment supplements income from domestic production.
The government provides for all medical services and subsidizes food
and housing. The government has shown progress in its basic policy of
diversifying the economy away from oil and gas. Brunei's leaders are
concerned that steadily increased integration in the world economy
will undermine internal social cohesion although it has taken steps to
become a more prominent player by serving as chairman for the 2000
APEC (Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation) forum. Growth in 1999 is
estimated at 2.5% due to higher oil prices in the second half.

@Bulgaria:Economy

Economy - overview: In April 1997, the current ruling Union of
Democratic Forces (UDF) government won pre-term parliamentary
elections and introduced an IMF currency board system which succeeded
in stabilizing the economy. The triple digit inflation of 1996 and
1997 has given way to an official consumer price increase of 6.2% in
1999. Following declines in GDP in both 1996 and 1997, the economy
grew an officially estimated 3.5% in 1998 and 2.5% in 1999. In
September 1998, the IMF approved a three-year Extended Fund Facility,
which provides credits worth approximately $900 million, designed to
support Bulgaria's reform efforts. In 1999, an unfavorable
international environment - primarily caused by the Kosovo conflict -
and structural reforms slowed economic growth, but forecasters are
predicting accelerated growth over the next several years. The
government's structural reform program includes: (a) privatization
and, where appropriate, liquidation of state-owned enterprises (SOEs);
(b) liberalization of agricultural policies, including creating
conditions for the development of a land market; (c) reform of the
country's social insurance programs; and (d) reforms to strengthen
contract enforcement and fight crime and corruption.

@Burma:Economy

Economy - overview: Burma has a mixed economy with private activity
dominant in agriculture, light industry, and transport, and with
substantial state-controlled activity, mainly in energy, heavy
industry, and the rice trade. Government policy in the last 11 years,
1989-99, has aimed at revitalizing the economy after three decades of
tight central planning. Thus, private activity has markedly increased;
foreign investment has been encouraged, so far with moderate success.
State enterprises remain highly inefficient and privatization efforts
have stalled. Published estimates of Burma's foreign trade are greatly
understated because of the volume of black-market trade. A major
ongoing problem is the failure to achieve monetary and fiscal
stability. Burma remains a poor Asian country and living standards for
the majority have not improved over the past decade. The short-term
outlook is for continued sluggish growth because of poor government
planning, internal unrest, minimal foreign investment, and the large
trade deficit.

decline from 1998); surrender of drug warlord KHUN SA's Mong Tai Army
in January 1996 was hailed by Rangoon as a major counternarcotics
success, but lack of government will and ability to take on major
narcotrafficking groups and lack of serious commitment against money
laundering continues to hinder the overall antidrug effort; becoming a
major source of methamphetamines for regional consumption

BURUNDI

@Burundi:Introduction

Background: Between 1993 and 1999, ethnic violence between Hutu and
Tutsi factions in Burundi created hundreds of thousands of refugees
and left at least 250,000 dead. Although many refugees have returned

to flee. Burundian troops, seeking to secure their borders, have
intervened in the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

@Burundi:Economy

Economy - overview: Burundi is a landlocked, resource-poor country
with an underdeveloped manufacturing sector. The economy is
predominantely agricultural with roughly 90% of the population
dependent on subsistence agriculture. Its economic health depends on
the coffee crop, which accounts for 80% of foreign exchange earnings.
The ability to pay for imports therefore rests largely on the vagaries
of the climate and the international coffee market. Since October 1993
the nation has suffered from massive ethnic-based violence which has
resulted in the death of perhaps 250,000 persons and the displacement
of about 800,000 others. Foods, medicines, and electricity remain in
short supply.

CAMBODIA

@Cambodia:Introduction

Background: Following a five-year struggle, communist Khmer Rouge
forces captured Phnom Penh in 1975 and ordered the evacuation of all
cities and towns; over 1 million displaced people died from execution
or enforced hardships. A 1978 Vietnamese invasion drove the Khmer
Rouge into the countryside and touched off 13 years of fighting.
UN-sponsored elections in 1993 helped restore some semblance of
normalcy, as did the rapid diminishment of the Khmer Rouge in the
mid-1990s. A coalition government, formed after national elections in
1998, brought renewed political stability and the surrender of
remaining Khmer Rouge forces.

@Cambodia:Economy

Economy - overview: After four years of solid macroeconomic
performance, Cambodia's economy slowed dramatically in 1997-98 due to
the regional economic crisis, civil violence, and political
infighting. Foreign investment and tourism fell off. Also, in 1998 the
main harvest was hit by drought. But in 1999, the first full year of
peace in 30 years, progress was made on economic reforms and growth
resumed at 4%. The long-term development of the economy after decades
of war remains a daunting challenge. The population lacks education
and productive skills, particularly in the poverty-ridden countryside,
which suffers from an almost total lack of basic infrastructure.
Recurring political instability and corruption within government
discourage foreign investment and delay foreign aid. On the brighter
side, the government is addressing these issues with assistance from
bilateral and multilateral donors. So long as political stability
lasts, the Cambodian economy is likely to grow at a respectable pace.

@Cameroon:Economy

Economy - overview: Because of its oil resources and favorable
agricultural conditions, Cameroon has one of the best-endowed primary
commodity economies in sub-Saharan Africa. Still, it faces many of the
serious problems facing other underdeveloped countries, such as a
top-heavy civil service and a generally unfavorable climate for
business enterprise. Since 1990, the government has embarked on
various IMF and World Bank programs designed to spur business
investment, increase efficiency in agriculture, improve trade, and
recapitalize the nation's banks. The government, however, has failed
to press forward vigorously with these programs. The latest enhanced
structural adjustment agreement was signed in October 1997; the
parties hope this will prove more successful, yet government
mismanagement and corruption remain problems. Inflation has been
brought back under control. Progress toward privatization of remaining
state industry should support continued economic growth in 2000.

@Canada:Economy

Economy - overview: As an affluent, high-tech industrial society,
Canada today closely resembles the US in its market-oriented economic
system, pattern of production, and high living standards. Since World
War II, the impressive growth of the manufacturing, mining, and
service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural
economy into one primarily industrial and urban. Real rates of growth
have averaged nearly 3.0% since 1993. Unemployment is falling and
government budget surpluses are being partially devoted to reducing
the large public sector debt. The 1989 US-Canada Free Trade Agreement
(FTA) and 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) (which
included Mexico) have touched off a dramatic increase in trade and
economic integration with the US. With its great natural resources,
skilled labor force, and modern capital plant Canada enjoys solid
economic prospects. Two shadows loom, the first being the continuing
constitutional impasse between English- and French-speaking areas,
which has been raising the possibility of a split in the federation.
Another long-term concern is the flow south to the US of professional
persons lured by higher pay, lower taxes, and the immense high-tech
infrastructure.

@Cape Verde:Economy

Economy - overview: Cape Verde's low per capita GDP reflects a poor
natural resource base, including serious water shortages exacerbated
by cycles of long-term drought. The economy is service-oriented, with
commerce, transport, and public services accounting for almost 70% of
GDP. Although nearly 70% of the population lives in rural areas, the
share of agriculture in GDP in 1998 was only 13%, of which fishing
accounts for 1.5%. About 90% of food must be imported. The fishing
potential, mostly lobster and tuna, is not fully exploited. Cape Verde
annually runs a high trade deficit, financed by foreign aid and
remittances from emigrants; remittances constitute a supplement to GDP
of more than 20%. Economic reforms, launched by the new democratic
government in 1991, are aimed at developing the private sector and
attracting foreign investment to diversify the economy. Prospects for
2000 depend heavily on the maintenance of aid flows, remittances, and
the momentum of the government's development program.

@Central African Republic:Economy

Economy - overview: Subsistence agriculture, together with forestry,
remains the backbone of the economy of the Central African Republic
(CAR), with more than 70% of the population living in outlying areas.
The agricultural sector generates half of GDP. Timber has accounted
for about 16% of export earnings and the diamond industry for nearly
54%. Important constraints to economic development include the CAR's
landlocked position, a poor transportation system, a largely unskilled
work force, and a legacy of misdirected macroeconomic policies. The
50% devaluation of the currencies of 14 Francophone African nations on
12 January 1994 had mixed effects on the CAR's economy. Diamond,
timber, coffee, and cotton exports increased, leading an estimated
rise of GDP of 7% in 1994 and nearly 5% in 1995. Military rebellions
and social unrest in 1996 were accompanied by widespread destruction
of property and a drop in GDP of 2%. Ongoing violence between the
government and rebel military groups over pay issues, living
conditions, and political representation has destroyed many businesses
in the capital and reduced tax revenues for the government. The IMF
approved an Extended Structure Adjustment Facility in 1998. The
government has set targets of annual 5% growth and 2.5% inflation for
2000-2001.

CHAD

@Chad:Introduction

Background: Chad, part of France's African holdings until 1960,
endured three decades of ethnic warfare as well as invasions by Libya
before a semblance of peace was finally restored in 1990. A
transitional government eventually suppressed or came to terms with
most political-military groups, settled a territorial dispute with
Libya on terms favorable to Chad, drafted a democratic constitution,
and held multiparty presidential and National Assembly elections in
1996 and 1997 respectively. In 1998 a new rebellion broke out in
northern Chad, which continued to escalate throughout 1999. Despite
movement toward democratic reform, power remains in the hands of a
northern ethnic oligarchy.

@Chad:Economy

Economy - overview: Landlocked Chad's economic development suffers
from it's geographic remoteness, drought, lack of infrastructure, and
political turmoil. About 85% of the population depends on agriculture,
including the herding of livestock. Of Africa's Francophone countries,
Chad benefited least from the 50% devaluation of their currencies in
January 1994. Financial aid from the World Bank, the African
Development Fund, and other sources is directed largely at the
improvement of agriculture, especially livestock production. Due to
lack of financing, the development of the Doba Basin oil fields,
originally due to finish in 2000, has been substantially delayed.

@Chile:Economy

Economy - overview: Chile has a market-oriented economy characterized
by a high level of foreign trade. During the early 1990s, Chile's
reputation as a role model for economic reform was strengthened when
the democratic government of Patricio AYLWIN - which took over from
the military in 1990 - deepened the economic reform initiated by the
military government. Growth in real GDP averaged 8% during the period
1991-1997, but fell to half that level in 1998 because of tight
monetary policies implemented to keep the current account deficit in
check and lower export earnings - the latter a product of the global
financial crisis. A severe drought exacerbated the recession in 1999,
reducing crop yields and causing hydroelectric shortfalls and
rationing, and Chile experienced negative economic growth for the
first time in more than 15 years. Despite the effects of the
recession, Chile maintained its reputation for strong financial
institutions and sound policy that have given it the strongest
sovereign bond rating in South America. By the end of 1999, exports
and economic activity had begun to recover, and a return to strong
growth in 2000 is likely. The inauguration of Ricardo LAGOS in March
2000, succeeding Eduardo FREI, will keep the presidency in the hands
of the center-left Concertacion coalition that has held office since
the return of civilian rule in 1990.

civil unrest, military defeats, and foreign occupation. After World
War II, the Communists under MAO Zedong established a dictatorship
that, while ensuring China's sovereignty, imposed strict controls over
everyday life and cost the lives of tens of millions of people. After
1978, his successor DENG Xiaoping decentralized economic decision
making. Output quadrupled in the next 20 years and China now has the
world's second largest GDP. Political controls remain tight even while
economic controls continue to weaken.

@China:Economy

Economy - overview: Beginning in late 1978 the Chinese leadership has
been moving the economy from a sluggish Soviet-style centrally planned
economy to a more market-oriented economy but still within a rigid
political framework of Communist Party control. To this end the
authorities have switched to a system of household responsibility in
agriculture in place of the old collectivization, increased the
authority of local officials and plant managers in industry, permitted
a wide variety of small-scale enterprise in services and light
manufacturing, and opened the economy to increased foreign trade and
investment. The result has been a quadrupling of GDP since 1978. In
1999, with its 1.25 billion people but a GDP of just $3,800 per
capita, China became the second largest economy in the world after the
US. Agricultural output doubled in the 1980s, and industry also posted
major gains, especially in coastal areas near Hong Kong and opposite
Taiwan, where foreign investment helped spur output of both domestic
and export goods. On the darker side, the leadership has often
experienced in its hybrid system the worst results of socialism
(bureaucracy, lassitude, corruption) and of capitalism (windfall gains
and stepped-up inflation). Beijing thus has periodically backtracked,
retightening central controls at intervals. In late 1993 China's
leadership approved additional long-term reforms aimed at giving still
more play to market-oriented institutions and at strengthening the
center's control over the financial system; state enterprises would
continue to dominate many key industries in what was now termed "a
socialist market economy". In 1995-99 inflation dropped sharply,
reflecting tighter monetary policies and stronger measures to control
food prices. At the same time, the government struggled to (a) collect
revenues due from provinces, businesses, and individuals; (b) reduce
corruption and other economic crimes; and (c) keep afloat the large
state-owned enterprises, most of which had not participated in the
vigorous expansion of the economy and many of which had been losing
the ability to pay full wages and pensions. From 50 to 100 million
surplus rural workers are adrift between the villages and the cities,
many subsisting through part-time low-paying jobs. Popular resistance,
changes in central policy, and loss of authority by rural cadres have
weakened China's population control program, which is essential to
maintaining growth in living standards. Another long-term threat to
continued rapid economic growth is the deterioration in the
environment, notably air pollution, soil erosion, and the steady fall
of the water table especially in the north. China continues to lose
arable land because of erosion and economic development. The next few
years will witness increasing tensions between a highly centralized
political system and an increasingly decentralized economic system.

@Christmas Island:Economy

Economy - overview: Phosphate mining had been the only significant
economic activity, but in December 1987 the Australian Government
closed the mine. In 1991, the mine was reopened by union workers. With
the support of the government, Australian-based Casinos Austria
International Ltd. built a $34 million casino on Christmas Island,
which opened in 1993. As of yearend 1999, gaming facilities at the
casino were temporarily closed but were expected to reopen in early
2000. Another economic prospect is the possible location of a
space-launching site on the island.

COLOMBIA

@Colombia:Introduction

Background: Colombia was one of the three countries that emerged from
the collapse of Gran Colombia in 1830 (the others being Ecuador and
Venezuela). A 40-year insurgent campaign to overthrow the Colombian
Government escalated during the 1990s, undergirded in part by funds
from the drug trade. Although the violence is deadly and large swaths
of the countryside are under guerrilla influence, the movement lacks
the military strength or popular support necessary to overthrow the
government. While Bogota continues to try to negotiate a settlement,
neighboring countries worry about the violence spilling over their
borders.

@Colombia:Economy

Economy - overview: Colombia is poised for moderate growth in the next
several years, marking an end to the severe 1999 recession when GDP
fell by about 5%. President PASTRANA's well-respected economic team is
taking steps to keep the recovery on track, such as lowering interest
rates and shoring up the financial system. In its loan agreement with
the IMF, the administration has pledged to take additional steps to
restore growth, reduce inflation, and improve the public sector's
fiscal health. Many challenges to sustainable growth remain, however.
Unemployment reached a record 20% in 1999 and may remain high,
contributing to the extreme inequality in income distribution.
Colombia's leading exports, oil and coffee, face an uncertain future:
new exploration is needed to offset a pending decline in oil
production, and the coffee harvest has dropped off because of aging
plantations and natural disasters. The lack of public security is a
key concern for investors, making progress in the government's peace
negotiations with insurgent groups an important driver of economic
performance. Colombia is looking for international financial
assistance to boost economic recovery and peace prospects.

@Comoros:Economy

Economy - overview: One of the world's poorest countries, Comoros is
made up of three islands that have inadequate transportation links, a
young and rapidly increasing population, and few natural resources.
The low educational level of the labor force contributes to a
subsistence level of economic activity, high unemployment, and a heavy
dependence on foreign grants and technical assistance. Agriculture,
including fishing, hunting, and forestry, is the leading sector of the
economy. It contributes 40% to GDP, employs 80% of the labor force,
and provides most of the exports. The country is not self-sufficient
in food production; rice, the main staple, accounts for the bulk of
imports. The government is struggling to upgrade education and
technical training, to privatize commercial and industrial
enterprises, to improve health services, to diversify exports, to
promote tourism, and to reduce the high population growth rate.
Continued foreign support is essential if the goal of 4% annual GDP
growth is to be met.

COOK ISLANDS

@Cook Islands:Introduction

Background: Named after Captain Cook, who sighted them in 1770, the
islands became a British protectorate in 1888. By 1900, administrative
control was transferred to New Zealand; in 1965 residents chose
self-government in free association with New Zealand. The emigration
of skilled workers to New Zealand and government deficits are
continuing problems.

@Cook Islands:Economy

Economy - overview: Like many other South Pacific island nations, the
Cook Islands' economic development is hindered by the isolation of the
country from foreign markets, lack of natural resources, periodic
devastation from natural disasters, and inadequate infrastructure.
Agriculture provides the economic base with major exports made up of
copra and citrus fruit. Manufacturing activities are limited to
fruit-processing, clothing, and handicrafts. Trade deficits are made
up for by remittances from emigrants and by foreign aid,
overwhelmingly from New Zealand. Efforts to exploit tourism potential,
encourage offshore banking, and expand the mining and fishing
industries have been partially successful in stimulating investment
and growth.

@Costa Rica:Economy

Economy - overview: Costa Rica's basically stable economy depends on
tourism, agriculture, and electronics exports. Poverty has been
substantially reduced over the past 15 years, and a strong social
safety net has been put into place. Economic growth has rebounded from
-0.9% in 1996 to 4% in 1997, 6% in 1998, and 7% in 1999. Inflation
rose to 22.5% in 1995, dropped to 11.1% in 1997, 12% in 1998, and 11%
in 1999. Large government deficits - fueled by interest payments on
the massive internal debt - have undermined efforts to maintain the
quality of social services. Curbing inflation, reducing the deficit,
and improving public sector efficiency remain key challenges to the
government. Political resistance to privatization has stalled
liberalization efforts.

CROATIA

@Croatia:Introduction

Background: In 1918, the Croats, Serbs, and Slovenes formed a kingdom
known after 1929 as Yugoslavia. Following World War II, Yugoslavia
became an independent communist state under the strong hand of Marshal
TITO. Although Croatia declared its independence from Yugoslavia in
1991, it took four years of sporadic, but often bitter, fighting
before occupying Serb armies were mostly cleared from Croatian lands.

@Croatia:Economy

Economy - overview: Before the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the Republic
of Croatia, after Slovenia, was the most prosperous and industrialized
area, with a per capita output perhaps one-third above the Yugoslav
average. Croatia faces considerable economic problems stemming from:
the legacy of longtime communist mismanagement of the economy; damage
during the internecine fighting to bridges, factories, power lines,
buildings, and houses; the large refugee and displaced population,
both Croatian and Bosnian; and the disruption of economic ties.
Western aid and investment, especially in the tourist and oil
industries, would help restore the economy. The government has been
successful in some reform efforts - partially macroeconomic
stabilization policies - and it has normalized relations with its
creditors. Yet it still is struggling with privatization of large
state enterprises and with bank reform. The recession that began at
the end of 1998 continued through most of 1999, and GDP growth for the
year was flat. Inflation remained in check and the kuna was stable.
The death of President TUDJMAN in December 1999, and the defeat of his
ruling Coatian Democratic Union or HDZ party in parliamentary and
presidential elections in January 2000 has ushered in a new government
committed to economic reform but faced with the challenge of halting
the economic decline.

CUBA

@Cuba:Introduction

Background: Fidel CASTRO led a rebel army to victory in 1959; his iron
will has held the country together since. Cuba's communist revolution,
with Soviet support, was exported throughout Latin America and Africa
during the 1960s, 70s, and 80s. The country is now slowly recovering
from a severe economic recession following the withdrawal of former
Soviet subsidies, worth $4 billion to $6 billion annually, in 1990.
Havana blames its difficulties on the US embargo in place since 1962.

@Cuba:Economy

Economy - overview: The state under the durable dictatorship of Fidel
CASTRO plays the primary role in the domestic economy and controls
practically all foreign trade. The government has undertaken several
reforms in recent years to stem excess liquidity, increase labor
incentives, and alleviate serious shortages of food, consumer goods,
and services. The liberalized agricultural markets introduced in
October 1994, at which state and private farmers sell above-quota
production at unrestricted prices, have broadened legal consumption
alternatives and reduced black market prices. Government efforts to
lower subsidies to unprofitable enterprises and to shrink the money
supply caused the semi-official exchange rate for the Cuban peso to
move from a peak of 120 to the dollar in the summer of 1994 to 21 to
the dollar by yearend 1999. New taxes introduced in 1996 have helped
drive down the number of self-employed workers from 208,000 in January
1996. Havana announced in 1995 that GDP declined by 35% during
1989-93, the result of lost Soviet aid and domestic inefficiencies.
The drop in GDP apparently halted in 1994, when Cuba reported 0.7%
growth, followed by increases of 2.5% in 1995 and 7.8% in 1996. Growth
slowed again in 1997 and 1998 to 2.5% and 1.2% respectively. Growth
recovered again in 1999 with a 6.2% increase in GDP, due to the
continued growth of tourism. Central control is complicated by the
existence of the informal economy, much of which is denominated in
dollars. Living standards for the average (dollarless) Cuban remain at
a depressed level compared with 1990. The continuation of gradual
economic reforms and increase in tourism suggest growth of 4% to 5% in
2000.

CYPRUS

@Cyprus:Introduction

Background: Independence from the UK was approved in 1960 with
constitutional guarantees by the Greek Cypriot majority to the Turkish
Cypriot minority. In 1974 a Greek-sponsored attempt to seize the
government was met by military intervention from Turkey, which soon
controlled almost 40% of the island. In 1983 the Turkish-held area
declared itself the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, but it is
recognized only by Turkey. Cyprus talks resumed in December 1999 to
prepare the ground for a comprehensive settlement.

@Cyprus:Economy

Economy - overview: Economic affairs are dominated by the division of
the country into the southern (Greek) area controlled by the Cyprus
Government and the northern Turkish Cypriot-administered area. The
Greek Cypriot economy is prosperous but highly susceptible to external
shocks. Erratic growth rates in the 1990s reflect the economy's
vulnerability to swings in tourist arrivals, caused by political
instability on the island and fluctuations in economic conditions in
Western Europe. Economic policy in the south is focused on meeting the
criteria for admission to the EU. As in the Turkish sector, water
shortage is a growing problem, and several desalination plants are
planned. The Turkish Cypriot economy has about one-fifth the
population and one-third the per capita GDP of the south. Because it
is recognized only by Turkey, it has had much difficulty arranging
foreign financing, and foreign firms have hesitated to invest there.
The economy remains heavily dependent on agriculture and government
service, which together employ about half of the work force. Moreover,
the small, vulnerable economy has suffered because the Turkish lira is
legal tender. To compensate for the economy's weakness, Turkey
provides direct and indirect aid to tourism, education, industry, etc.

CZECH REPUBLIC

@Czech Republic:Introduction

Background: After World War II, Czechoslovakia fell within the Soviet
sphere of influence. In 1968, an invasion by Warsaw Pact troops ended
the efforts of the country's leaders to liberalize party rule and
create "socialism with a human face." Anti-Soviet demonstrations the
following year ushered in a period of harsh repression. With the
collapse of Soviet authority in 1989, Czechoslovakia regained its
freedom through a peaceful "Velvet Revolution." On 1 January 1993, the
country underwent a "velvet divorce" into its two national components,
the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Now a member of NATO, the Czech
Republic has moved toward integration in world markets, a development
that poses both opportunities and risks.

@Czech Republic:Economy

Economy - overview: Political and financial crises in 1997 shattered
the Czech Republic's image as one of the most stable and prosperous of
post-Communist states. Delays in enterprise restructuring and failure
to develop a well-functioning capital market played major roles in
Czech economic troubles, which culminated in a currency crisis in May.
The currency was forced out of its fluctuation band as investors
worried that the current account deficit, which reached nearly 8% of
GDP in 1996, would become unsustainable. After expending $3 billion in
vain to support the currency, the central bank let it float. The
growing current account imbalance reflected a surge in domestic demand
and poor export performance, as wage increases outpaced productivity.
The government was forced to introduce two austerity packages later in
the spring which cut government spending by 2.5% of GDP. Growth
dropped to 0.3% in 1997, -2.3% in 1998, and -0.5% in 1999. The basic
transition problem continues to be too much direct and indirect
government influence on the privatized economy. The government
established a restructuring agency in 1999 and launched a
revitalization program - to spur the sale of firms to foreign
companies. Key priorities include accelerating legislative convergence
with EU norms, restructuring enterprises, and privatizing banks and
utilities. The economy, fueled by increased export growth and
investment, is expected to recover in 2000.

@Denmark:Economy

Economy - overview: This thoroughly modern market economy features
high-tech agriculture, up-to-date small-scale and corporate industry,
extensive government welfare measures, comfortable living standards,
and high dependence on foreign trade. Denmark is a net exporter of
food. The center-left coalition government is concentrating on
reducing the unemployment rate and the budget deficit as well as
following the previous government's policies of maintaining low
inflation and a current account surplus. The coalition also vows to
maintain a stable currency. The coalition has lowered marginal income
tax rates while maintaining overall tax revenues; boosted industrial
competitiveness through labor market and tax reforms; increased
research and development funds; and improved welfare services for the
neediest while cutting paperwork and delays. Denmark chose not to join
the 11 other EU members who launched the euro on 1 January 1999.

@Djibouti:Economy

Economy - overview: The economy is based on service activities
connected with the country's strategic location and status as a free
trade zone in northeast Africa. Two-thirds of the inhabitants live in
the capital city, the remainder being mostly nomadic herders. Scanty
rainfall limits crop production to fruits and vegetables, and most
food must be imported. Djibouti provides services as both a transit
port for the region and an international transshipment and refueling
center. It has few natural resources and little industry. The nation
is, therefore, heavily dependent on foreign assistance to help support
its balance of payments and to finance development projects. An
unemployment rate of 40% to 50% continues to be a major problem.
Inflation is not a concern, however, because of the fixed tie of the
franc to the US dollar. Per capita consumption dropped an estimated
35% over the last seven years because of recession, civil war, and a
high population growth rate (including immigrants and refugees). Also,
renewed fighting between Ethiopia and Eritrea has disturbed normal
external channels of commerce. Faced with a multitude of economic
difficulties, the government has fallen in arrears on long-term
external debt and has been struggling to meet the stipulations of
foreign aid donors.

DOMINICA

@Dominica:Introduction

Background: Dominica was the last of the Caribbean islands to be
colonized by Europeans, due chiefly to the fierce resistance of the
native Caribs. France ceded possession to Great Britain in 1763, which
made the island a colony in 1805. In 1980, two years after
independence, Dominica's fortunes improved when a corrupt and
tyrannical administration was replaced by that of Mary Eugenia
CHARLES, the first female prime minister in the Caribbean, who
remained in office for 15 years.

@Dominica:Economy

Economy - overview: The economy depends on agriculture and is highly
vulnerable to climatic conditions, notably tropical storms.
Agriculture, primarily bananas, accounts for 21% of GDP and employs
40% of the labor force. Development of the tourist industry remains
difficult because of the rugged coastline, lack of beaches, and the
lack of an international airport. Hurricane Luis devastated the
country's banana crop in September 1995; tropical storms had wiped out
one-quarter of the crop in 1994 as well. The economy's recovery
continued in 1998, fueled by increases in construction, soap
production, and tourist arrivals. The government is attempting to
develop an offshore financial industry in order to diversify the
island's production base.

@Dominican Republic:Economy

Economy - overview: In December 1996, incoming President FERNANDEZ
presented a bold reform package for this Caribbean economy - including
the devaluation of the peso, income tax cuts, a 50% increase in sales
taxes, reduced import tariffs, and increased gasoline prices - in an
attempt to create a market-oriented economy that can compete
internationally. Even though most reforms are stalled in the
legislature - including the intellectual property rights bill, social
security reform, and a new electricity law first submitted in 1993 -
the economy has grown vigorously under FERNANDEZ's administration.
Construction, tourism and telecommunications are leading the advance.
The government is working to increase electric generating capacity, a
key to continued economic growth; the state electricity company was
finally privatized following numerous delays. The continuation of this
vigorous growth in 2000 will depend on the policies adopted by the new
administration.

@Ecuador:Economy

Economy - overview: Ecuador has substantial oil resources and rich
agricultural areas. Because the country exports primary products such
as oil, bananas, and shrimp, fluctuations in world market prices can
have a substantial domestic impact. Ecuador joined the World Trade
Organization in 1996, but has failed to comply with many of its
accession commitments. In recent years, growth has been uneven due to
ill-conceived fiscal stabilization measures. The aftermath of El Nino
and depressed oil market of 1997-98 drove Ecuador's economy into a
free-fall in 1999. The beginning of 1999 saw the banking sector
collapse, which helped precipitate an unprecedented default on
external loans later that year. Continued economic instability drove a
70% depreciation of the currency throughout 1999, which eventually
forced a desperate government to dollarize the currency regime in
2000. The move stabilized the currency, but did not stave off the
ouster of the government. The new president, Gustavo NOBOA has yet to
complete negotiations for a long sought IMF accord. He will find it
difficult to push through the reforms necessary to make dollarization
work in the long-run.

@Egypt:Economy

Economy - overview: A series of IMF arrangements - coupled with
massive external debt relief resulting from Egypt's participation in
the Gulf war coalition - helped Egypt improve its macroeconomic
performance during the 1990s. Through sound fiscal and monetary
policies, Cairo tamed inflation, slashed budget deficits, and built up
foreign reserves. Although the pace of structural reforms - such as
privatization and new business legislation - has been slower than the
IMF envisioned, Egypt's steps toward a more market-oriented economy
have prompted increased foreign investment. Lower combined hard
currency inflows - from tourism, worker remittances, oil revenues, and
Suez Canal tolls - in 1998 and the first half of 1999 resulted in
pressure on the Egyptian pound and sporadic dollar shortages, but
external payments were not in crisis. Despite ample reserves, the
Central Bank did not provide sufficient hard currency to commercial
banks and Cairo restricted imports for a short period; these
developments confirmed to some investors and currency traders that
government financial operations lack sufficient coordination and
openness. Monetary pressures have since eased, however, with the
continued oil price recovery starting in mid-1999 and a moderate
rebound in tourism. Increased gas exports are a major plus factor in
future growth.

substantial trade deficit has been offset by remittances from the
large number of Salvadorans living abroad and from external aid.

@Equatorial Guinea:Economy

Economy - overview: The discovery and exploitation of large oil
reserves have contributed to dramatic economic growth in recent years.
Forestry, farming, and fishing are also major components of GDP.
Subsistence farming predominates. Although pre-independence Equatorial
Guinea counted on cocoa production for hard currency earnings, the
deterioration of the rural economy under successive brutal regimes has
diminished potential for agriculture-led growth. A number of aid
programs sponsored by the World Bank and the IMF have been cut off
since 1993 because of the government's gross corruption and
mismanagement. Businesses, for the most part, are owned by government
officials and their family members. Undeveloped natural resources
include titanium, iron ore, manganese, uranium, and alluvial gold. The
country responded favorably to the devaluation of the CFA franc in
January 1994. Boosts in production, along with high world oil prices,
should further stimulate growth in 2000-2001.

ERITREA

@Eritrea:Introduction

Background: Eritrea was awarded to Ethiopia in 1952 as part of a
federation. Ethiopia's annexation of Eritrea as a province 10 years
later sparked a 30-year struggle for independence that ended in 1991
with Eritrean rebels defeating governmental forces; independence was
overwhelmingly approved in a 1993 referendum. A border war with
Ethiopia that erupted in 1998 remains unresolved.

@Eritrea:Economy

Economy - overview: With independence from Ethiopia on 24 May 1993,
Eritrea faced the economic problems of a small, desperately poor
country. The economy is largely based on subsistence agriculture, with
80% of the population involved in farming and herding. The small
industrial sector consists mainly of light industries with outmoded
technologies. Domestic output (GDP) is substantially augmented by
worker remittances from abroad. Government revenues come from custom
duties and taxes on income and sales. Road construction is a top
domestic priority. In the long term, Eritrea may benefit from the
development of offshore oil, offshore fishing, and tourism. Eritrea's
economic future depends on its ability to master fundamental social
and economic problems, e.g., by reducing illiteracy, promoting job
creation, expanding technical training, attracting foreign investment,
and streamlining the bureaucracy. The most immediate threat to the
economy, however, is the possible expansion of the border conflict
with Ethiopia, which broke out in May 1998. The hostilities have
drained away substantial resources vital to Eritrea's economic
development.

ETHIOPIA

@Ethiopia:Introduction

Background: Unique among African countries, the ancient Ethiopian
monarchy maintained its freedom from colonial rule, one exception
being the Italian occupation of 1936-41. In 1974 a military junta, the
Derg, deposed Emperor Haile SALASSIE (who had ruled since 1930) and
established a socialist state. Torn by bloody coups, uprisings,
wide-scale drought, and massive refugee problems, the regime was
finally toppled by a coalition of rebel forces, the Ethiopian People's
Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), in 1991. A constitution was
adopted in 1994 and Ethiopia's first multiparty elections were held in
1995. A border war with Eritrea that erupted in May 1998 has
strengthened the ruling coalition, but has hurt the nation's economy.

@Ethiopia:Economy

Economy - overview: Ethiopia's economy is based on agriculture, which
accounts for half of GDP, 90% of exports, and 80% of total employment.
The agricultural sector suffers from frequent periods of drought and
poor cultivation practices, and as many as 4.6 million people need
food assistance annually. Coffee is critical to the Ethiopian economy,
and Ethiopia earned $267 million in 1999 by exporting 105,000 metric
tons. According to current estimates, coffee contributes 10% of
Ethiopia's GDP. More than 15 million people (25% of the population)
derive their livelihood from the coffee sector. Other exports include
live animals, hides, gold, and qat. In December 1999, Ethiopia signed
a $1.4 billion joint venture deal to develop a huge natural gas field
in the Somali Regional State. The war with Eritrea has forced the
government to spend scarce resources on the military and forced the
government to scale back ambitious development plans. Foreign
investment has declined significantly. Government taxes imposed in
late 1999 to raise money for the war will depress an already weak
economy. The war has forced the government to improve roads and other
parts of the previously neglected infrastructure, but only certain
regions of the nation have benefited.

@Faroe Islands:Economy

Economy - overview: After the severe economic troubles of the early
1990s, brought on by a drop in the vital fish catch, the Faroe Islands
have come back in the last few years, with unemployment down to 5% in
mid-1998. Nevertheless, the almost total dependence on fishing means
the economy remains extremely vulnerable. The Faroese hope to broaden
their economic base by building new fish-processing plants. Oil finds
close to the Faroese area give hope for deposits in the immediate
area, which may lay the basis to sustained economic prosperity. The
Faroese are supported by a substantial annual subsidy from Denmark.

FIJI

@Fiji:Introduction

Background: Fiji became independent in 1970, after nearly a century as
a British colony. Democratic rule was interrupted by two military
coups in 1987, caused by concern over a government perceived as
dominated by the Indian community (descendants of contract laborers
brought to the islands by the British in the 19th century). A 1990
constitution favored native Melanesian control of Fiji, but led to
heavy Indian emigration; the population loss resulted in economic
difficulties, but ensured that Melanesians became the majority.
Amendments enacted in 1997 made the constitution more equitable. Free
and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted in a government led by an
Indo-Fijian. Fiji has been a major contributor to UN peacekeeping
missions in various parts of the world.

@Fiji:Economy

Economy - overview: Fiji, endowed with forest, mineral, and fish
resources, is one of the most developed of the Pacific island
economies, though still with a large subsistence sector. Sugar exports
and a growing tourist industry are the major sources of foreign
exchange. Sugar processing makes up one-third of industrial activity.
Roughly 300,000 tourists visit each year, including thousands of
Americans following the start of regularly scheduled non-stop air
service from Los Angeles. Fiji's growth slowed in 1997 because the
sugar industry suffered from low world prices and rent disputes
between farmers and landowners. Drought in 1998 further damaged the
sugar industry, but its recovery in 1999 contributed to robust GDP
growth. Long-term problems include low investment and uncertain
property rights.

@Finland:Economy

Economy - overview: Finland has a highly industrialized, largely
free-market economy, with per capita output roughly that of the UK,
France, Germany, and Italy. Its key economic sector is manufacturing -
principally the wood, metals, engineering, telecommunications, and
electronics industries. Trade is important, with exports equaling more
than one-third of GDP. Except for timber and several minerals, Finland
depends on imports of raw materials, energy, and some components for
manufactured goods. Because of the climate, agricultural development
is limited to maintaining self-sufficiency in basic products.
Forestry, an important export earner, provides a secondary occupation
for the rural population. The economy has come back from the recession
of 1990-92, which had been caused by economic overheating, depressed
foreign markets, and the dismantling of the barter system between
Finland and the former Soviet Union. Rapidly increasing integration
with Western Europe - Finland was one of the 11 countries joining the
euro monetary system (EMU) on 1 January 1999 - will dominate the
economic picture over the next several years. Growth in 2000 will
probably be at the same level as in 1999, enough to continue the
decline in unemployment from its current high level.

FRANCE

@France:Introduction

Background: Although ultimately a victor in World Wars I and II,
France suffered extensive losses in its empire, wealth, manpower, and
rank as a dominant nation-state. Since 1958, it has constructed a
presidential democracy resistant to the instabilities experienced in
earlier parliamentary democracies. In recent years, its reconciliation
and cooperation with Germany have proved central to the economic
integration of Europe, including the advent of the euro in January
1999. Today, France is at the forefront of European states seeking to
exploit the momentum of monetary union to advance the creation of a
more unified and capable European defense and security apparatus.

@France:Economy

Economy - overview: France's economy combines modern capitalistic
methods with extensive, but declining, government intervention. The
government retains considerable influence over key segments of each
sector, with majority ownership of railway, electricity, aircraft, and
telecommunication firms. It has been gradually relaxing its control
over these sectors since the early 1990s. The government is slowly
selling off holdings in France Telecom, in Air France, and in the
insurance, banking, and defense industries. Meanwhile, large tracts of
fertile land, the application of modern technology, and subsidies have
combined to make France the leading agricultural producer in Western
Europe. Persistently high unemployment will continue to pose a major
problem for the government; a 35-hour work week is being introduced.
France has shied away from cutting exceptionally generous social
welfare benefits or the enormous state bureaucracy, preferring to pare
defense spending and raise taxes to keep the deficit down. France
joined 10 other EU members to launch the euro on 1 January 1999.

@French Guiana:Economy

Economy - overview: The economy is tied closely to that of France
through subsidies and imports. Besides the French space center at
Kourou, fishing and forestry are the most important economic
activities. The large reserves of tropical hardwoods, not fully
exploited, support an expanding sawmill industry which provides sawn
logs for export. Cultivation of crops is limited to the coastal area,
where the population is largely concentrated; rice and manioc are the
major crops. French Guiana is heavily dependent on imports of food and
energy. Unemployment is a serious problem, particularly among younger
workers.

@Gabon:Economy

Economy - overview: Gabon enjoys a per capita income four times that
of most nations of sub-Saharan Africa. This has supported a sharp
decline in extreme poverty; yet because of high income inequality a
large proportion of the population remains poor. Gabon depended on
timber and manganese until oil was discovered offshore in the early
1970s. The oil sector now accounts for 50% of GDP. Gabon continues to
face fluctuating prices for its oil, timber, manganese, and uranium
exports. Despite the abundance of natural wealth, the economy is
hobbled by poor fiscal management. In 1992, the fiscal deficit widened
to 2.4% of GDP, and Gabon failed to settle arrears on its bilateral
debt, leading to a cancellation of rescheduling agreements with
official and private creditors. Devaluation of its Francophone
currency by 50% on 12 January 1994 sparked a one-time inflationary
surge, to 35%; the rate dropped to 6% in 1996. The IMF provided a
one-year standby arrangement in 1994-95 and a three-year Enhanced
Financing Facility (EFF) at near commercial rates beginning in late
1995. Those agreements mandate progress in privatization and fiscal
discipline. France provided additional financial support in January
1997 after Gabon had met IMF targets for mid-1996. In 1997, an IMF
mission to Gabon criticized the government for overspending on
off-budget items, overborrowing from the central bank, and slipping on
its schedule for privatization and administrative reform. The rebound
of oil prices in 1999 helped growth, but drops in production hampered
Gabon from fully realizing potential gains. With support from higher
oil prices, growth will move up in 2000-01.

GAZA STRIP

@Gaza Strip:Introduction

Background: The Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles on Interim
Self-Government Arrangements (the DOP), signed in Washington on 13
September 1993, provides for a transitional period not exceeding five
years of Palestinian interim self-government in the Gaza Strip and the
West Bank. Under the DOP, Israel agreed to transfer certain powers and
responsibilities to the Palestinian Authority, which includes a
Palestinian Legislative Council elected in January 1996, as part of
interim self-governing arrangements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. A
transfer of powers and responsibilities for the Gaza Strip and Jericho
took place pursuant to the Israel-PLO 4 May 1994 Cairo Agreement on
the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area and in additional areas of the
West Bank pursuant to the Israel-PLO 28 September 1995 Interim
Agreement, the Israel-PLO 15 January 1997 Protocol Concerning
Redeployment in Hebron, the Israel-PLO 23 October 1998 Wye River
Memorandum, and the 4 September 1999 Sharm el-Sheikh Agreement. The
DOP provides that Israel will retain responsibility during the
transitional period for external security and for internal security
and public order of settlements and Israeli citizens. Permanent status
is to be determined through direct negotiations, which resumed in
September 1999 after a three-year hiatus.

@Gaza Strip:Economy

Economy - overview: Economic conditions in the Gaza Strip - under the
responsibility of the Palestinian Authority since the Cairo Agreement
of May 1994 - have deteriorated since the early 1990s. Real per capita
GDP for the West Bank and Gaza Strip (WBGS) declined 36% between 1992
and 1996 owing to the combined effect of falling aggregate incomes and
robust population growth. The downturn in economic activity was
largely the result of Israeli closure policies - the imposition of
generalized border closures in response to security incidents in
Israel - which disrupted previously established labor and commodity
market relationships between Israel and the WBGS. The most serious
negative social effect of this downturn has been the emergence of
chronic unemployment; average unemployment rates in the WBGS during
the 1980s were generally under 5%; by the mid-1990s this level had
risen to over 20%. Since 1997 Israel's use of comprehensive closures
has decreased and, in 1998, Israel implemented new policies to reduce
the impact of closures and other security procedures on the movement
of Palestinian goods and labor. In October 1999, Israel permitted the
opening of a safe passage between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank in
accordance with the 1995 Interim Agreement. These changes to the
conduct of economic activity have fueled a moderate economic recovery
in 1998-99.

@Georgia:Economy

Economy - overview: Georgia's economy has traditionally revolved
around Black Sea tourism; cultivation of citrus fruits, tea, and
grapes; mining of manganese and copper; and output of a small
industrial sector producing wine, metals, machinery, chemicals, and
textiles. The country imports the bulk of its energy needs, including
natural gas and oil products. Its only sizable internal energy
resource is hydropower. Despite the severe damage the economy has
suffered due to civil strife, Georgia, with the help of the IMF and
World Bank, made substantial economic gains since 1995, increasing GDP
growth and slashing inflation. The Georgian economy continues to
experience large budget deficits due to a failure to collect tax
revenues. Georgia also still suffers from energy shortages; it
privatized the distribution network in 1998, and deliveries are
steadily improving. Georgia is pinning its hopes for long-term
recovery on the development of an international transportation
corridor through the key Black Sea ports of P'ot'i and Bat'umi. The
growing trade deficit, continuing problems with tax evasion and
corruption, and political uncertainties cloud the short-term economic
picture. However, revived investment could spur higher economic growth
in 2000, perhaps up to 6%.

GERMANY

@Germany:Introduction

Background: As Western Europe's richest and most populous nation,
Germany remains a key member of the continent's economic, political,
and defense organizations. European power struggles immersed the
country in two devastating World Wars in the first half of the 20th
century and left the country occupied by the victorious Allied powers
of the US, UK, France, and the Soviet Union in 1945. With the advent
of the Cold War, two German states were formed in 1949: the western
Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and the eastern German Democratic
Republic (GDR). The democratic FRG embedded itself in key Western
economic and security organizations, the EC and NATO, while the
communist GDR was on the front line of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. The
decline of the USSR and the end of the Cold War allowed for German
unification in 1990. Since then Germany has expended considerable
funds to bring eastern productivity and wages up to western standards.
In January 1999, Germany and 10 other EU countries formed a common
European currency, the euro.

@Germany:Economy

Economy - overview: Germany possesses the world's third most
technologically powerful economy after the US and Japan, but its basic
capitalistic economy has started to struggle under the burden of
generous social benefits. Structural rigidities - like a high rate of
social contributions on wages - have made unemployment a long-term,
not just cyclical, problem, while Germany's aging population has
pushed social security outlays to exceed contributions from workers.
The integration and upgrading of the eastern German economy remains a
costly long-term problem, with annual transfers from the west
amounting to roughly $100 billion. Growth slowed to 1.5% in 1999,
largely due to lower export demand and still-low business confidence.
Recovering Asian demand, a push for fiscal consolidation, and newly
proposed business and income tax cuts - if passed - are expected to
boost growth back to trend rates around 2.5% in 2000 and beyond. The
adoption of a common European currency and the general political and
economic integration of Europe will bring major changes to the German
economy in the early 21st century.

@Ghana:Economy

Economy - overview: Well endowed with natural resources, Ghana has
twice the per capita output of the poorer countries in West Africa.
Even so, Ghana remains heavily dependent on international financial
and technical assistance. Gold, timber, and cocoa production are major
sources of foreign exchange. The domestic economy continues to revolve
around subsistence agriculture, which accounts for 40% of GDP and
employs 60% of the work force, mainly small landholders. In 1995-97,
Ghana made mixed progress under a three-year structural adjustment
program in cooperation with the IMF. On the minus side, public sector
wage increases and regional peacekeeping commitments have led to
continued inflationary deficit financing, depreciation of the cedi,
and rising public discontent with Ghana's austerity measures. A
rebound in gold prices is likely to push growth over 5% in 2000-01.

GREECE

@Greece:Introduction

Background: Greece achieved its independence from the Ottoman Empire
in 1829. During the second half of the 19th century and the first half
of the 20th century, it gradually added neighboring islands and
territories with Greek-speaking populations. Following the defeat of
communist rebels in 1949, Greece joined NATO in 1952. A military
dictatorship, which in 1967 had suspended many political liberties and
forced the king to flee the country, was itself overthrown seven years
later. Democratic elections in 1974 abolished the monarchy and created
a parliamentary republic; Greece joined the EU in 1981.

@Greece:Economy

Economy - overview: Greece has a mixed capitalist economy with the
public sector accounting for about half of GDP. The government plans
to privatize some leading state enterprises. Tourism is a key
industry, providing a large portion of GDP and foreign exchange
earnings. Greece is a major beneficiary of EU aid, equal to about 4%
of GDP. The economy has improved steadily over the last few years, as
the government has tightened policy with the goal of qualifying Greece
to join the EU's single currency (the euro) in 2001. In particular,
Greece has cut its budget deficit below 2% of GDP and tightened
monetary policy, with the result that inflation fell below 4% by the
end of 1998 - the lowest rate in 26 years - and averaged only 2.6% in
1999. Further restructuring of the economy and the reduction of
unemployment remain major challenges.

@Greenland:Economy

Economy - overview: Greenland suffered negative economic growth in the
early 1990s, but since 1993 the economy has improved. The Greenland
Home Rule Government (GHRG) has pursued a tight fiscal policy since
the late 1980s which has helped create surpluses in the public budget
and low inflation. Since 1990, Greenland has registered a foreign
trade deficit following the closure of the last remaining lead and
zinc mine in 1990. Greenland today is critically dependent on fishing
and fish exports; the shrimp fishery is by far the largest income
earner. Despite resumption of several interesting hydrocarbon and
minerals exploration activities, it will take several years before
production can materialize. Tourism is the only sector offering any
near-term potential and even this is limited due to a short season and
high costs. The public sector, including publicly owned enterprises
and the municipalities, plays the dominant role in Greenland's
economy. About half the government revenues come from grants from the
Danish Government, an important supplement of GDP.

@Grenada:Economy

Economy - overview: In this island economy progress in fiscal reforms
and prudent macroeconomic management have boosted annual growth to
5%-6% in 1998-99. The increase in economic activity has been led by
construction and trade. Tourist facilities are being expanded; tourism
is the leading foreign exchange earner. Major short-term concerns are
the rising fiscal deficit and the deterioration in the external
account balance. Grenada shares a common central bank and a common
currency with seven other members of the Organization of Eastern
Caribbean States (OECS).

@Guadeloupe:Economy

Economy - overview: The economy depends on agriculture, tourism, light
industry, and services. It also depends on France for large subsidies
and imports. Tourism is a key industry, with most tourists from the
US; an increasingly large number of cruise ships visit the islands.
The traditional sugarcane crop is slowly being replaced by other
crops, such as bananas (which now supply about 50% of export
earnings), eggplant, and flowers. Other vegetables and root crops are
cultivated for local consumption, although Guadeloupe is still
dependent on imported food, mainly from France. Light industry
features sugar and rum production. Most manufactured goods and fuel
are imported. Unemployment is especially high among the young.
Hurricanes periodically devastate the economy.

@Guam:Economy

Economy - overview: The economy depends mainly on US military spending
and on tourist revenue. Over the past 20 years, the tourist industry
has grown rapidly, creating a construction boom for new hotels and the
expansion of older ones. More than 1 million tourists visit Guam each
year. The industry suffered a setback in 1998 because of the
continuing Japanese recession; the Japanese normally make up almost
90% of the tourists. Most food and industrial goods are imported. Guam
faces the problem of building up the civilian economic sector to
offset the impact of military downsizing.

@Guatemala:Economy

Economy - overview: The agricultural sector accounts for one-fourth of
GDP, two-thirds of exports, and half of the labor force. Coffee,
sugar, and bananas are the main products. Manufacturing and
construction account for one-fifth of GDP. Since assuming office in
January 1996, former President ARZU worked to implement a program of
economic liberalization and political modernization. The signing of
the peace accords in December 1996, which ended 36 years of civil war,
removed a major obstacle to foreign investment. In 1998, Hurricane
Mitch caused relatively little damage to Guatemala compared to its
neighbors. Remaining challenges include beefing up government
revenues, negotiating further assistance from international donors,
and increasing the efficiency and openness of both government and
private financial operations. Growth should remain at the same level
in 2000 provided world agricultural prices do not plunge.

@Guernsey:Economy

Economy - overview: Financial services - banking, fund management,
insurance, etc. - account for about 55% of total income in this tiny
Channel Island economy. Tourism, manufacturing, and horticulture,
mainly tomatoes and cut flowers, have been declining. Light tax and
death duties make Guernsey a popular tax haven. The evolving economic
integration of the EU nations is changing the rules of the game under
which Guernsey operates.

@Guinea:Introduction

Background: Independent from France since 1958, Guinea did not hold
democratic elections until 1993 when Gen. Lansana CONTE (head of the
military government) was elected president in disputed balloting.
Security clampdowns continue, although not as severe as in earlier
decades. Reelected in 1998, the president faced growing criticism in
1999 for his jailing of a major opposition leader and widespread
economic malaise. Unrest in Sierra Leone also continued to threaten
Guinea's stability.

@Guinea:Economy

Economy - overview: Guinea possesses major mineral, hydropower, and
agricultural resources, yet remains a poor underdeveloped nation. The
agricultural sector employs 80% of the work force. Guinea possesses
over 25% of the world's bauxite reserves and is the second largest
bauxite producer. The mining sector accounted for about 75% of exports
in 1998. Long-run improvements in government fiscal arrangements,
literacy, and the legal framework are needed if the country is to move
out of poverty. The government made encouraging progress in budget
management in 1997-99. Even with a recovery in prices for some of
Guinea's main commodity exports, annual GDP is unlikely to increase by
more than 5% in 2000-2001.

@Guyana:Economy

Economy - overview: Severe drought and political turmoil contributed
to Guyana's negative growth of -1.8% for 1998 following six straight
years of growth of 5% or better. Growth came back to a positive 1.8%
in 1999. Underlying growth factors have included expansion in the key
agricultural and mining sectors, a more favorable atmosphere for
business initiative, a more realistic exchange rate, a moderate
inflation rate, and continued support by international organizations.
President JAGDEO, the former finance minister, is taking steps to
reform the economy, including drafting an investment code and
restructuring the inefficient and unresponsive public sector. Problems
include a shortage of skilled labor and an inadequate and poorly
maintained transportation system. Also, electricity has been in short
supply; the privatization of the sector in August 1999 is expected to
improve prospects. The government must persist in efforts to manage
its sizable external debt and extend its privatization program.

@Haiti:Economy

Economy - overview: About 80% of the population lives in abject
poverty. Nearly 70% of all Haitians depend on the agriculture sector,
which consists mainly of small-scale subsistence farming and employs
about two-thirds of the economically active work force. The country
has experienced little job creation since President PREVAL took office
in February 1996, although the informal economy is growing. Failure to
reach agreements with international sponsors have denied Haiti badly
needed budget and development assistance. Meeting aid conditions in
2000 will be especially challenging in the face of mounting popular
criticism of reforms.

@Honduras:Economy

Economy - overview: Honduras spent 1999 primarily recovering from
Hurricane Mitch, which killed more than 5,000 people and caused about
$3 billion in damage. Although it is slated to receive about $2.76
billion in international aid, the economy shrank 3% with widening
current account and fiscal deficits in 1999. It nevertheless met most
of its macroeconomic targets, and 2000 should see economic recovery as
reconstruction projects make progress and the agricultural sector
recovers. Honduras may also get relief from its $4.4 billion external
debt under the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative.

HONG KONG

@Hong Kong:Introduction

Background: Occupied by the UK in 1841, Hong Kong was formally ceded
by China the following year; various adjacent lands were added later
in the 19th century. Pursuant to an agreement signed by China and the
UK on 19 December 1984, Hong Kong became the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) of China on 1 July 1997. In this
agreement, China has promised that, under its "one country, two
systems" formula, China's socialist economic system will not be
practiced in Hong Kong and that Hong Kong will enjoy a high degree of
autonomy in all matters except foreign and defense affairs for the
next 50 years.

@Hong Kong:Economy

Economy - overview: Hong Kong has a bustling free market economy
highly dependent on international trade. Natural resources are
limited, and food and raw materials must be imported. Indeed, imports
and exports, including reexports, each exceed GDP in dollar value.
Even before Hong Kong reverted to Chinese administration on 1 July
1997 it had extensive trade and investment ties with China. Per capita
GDP compares with the level in the four big countries of Western
Europe. GDP growth averaged a strong 5% in 1989-97. The widespread
Asian economic difficulties in 1998 hit this trade-dependent economy
quite hard, with GDP down 5%. The economy is recovering, with growth
of 1.8% in 1999 to be followed by projected growth of 3.7% in 2000.

HUNGARY

@Hungary:Introduction

Background: Hungary was part of the polyglot Austro-Hungarian Empire,
which collapsed in World War I. It fell under communist rule following
World War II. A revolt in 1956 and an announced withdrawal from the
Warsaw Pact was met with massive military intervention by Moscow. In
the more open GORBACHEV years, Hungary led the movement to dissolve
the Warsaw Pact and steadily shifted toward multiparty democracy and a
market-oriented economy. Following the collapse of the USSR in 1991,
Hungary developed close political and economic ties to Western Europe.
It joined NATO in 1999 and is a frontrunner in a future expansion of
the EU.

@Iceland:Economy

Economy - overview: Iceland's Scandinavian-type economy is basically
capitalistic, yet with an extensive welfare system, low unemployment,
and remarkably even distribution of income. The economy depends
heavily on the fishing industry, which provides 70% of export earnings
and employs 12% of the work force. In the absence of other natural
resources (except for abundant hydrothermal and geothermal power),
Iceland's economy is vulnerable to changing world fish prices. The
economy remains sensitive to declining fish stocks as well as to drops
in world prices for its main exports: fish and fish products,
aluminum, and ferrosilicon. The center-right government plans to
continue its policies of reducing the budget and current account
deficits, limiting foreign borrowing, containing inflation, revising
agricultural and fishing policies, diversifying the economy, and
privatizing state-owned industries. The government remains opposed to
EU membership, primarily because of Icelanders' concern about losing
control over their fishing resources. Iceland's economy has been
diversifying into manufacturing and service industries in the last
decade, and new developments in software production, biotechnology,
and financial services are taking place. The tourism sector is also
expanding, with the recent trends in ecotourism and whale-watching.
Growth is likely to slow in 2000, to a still respectable 3.5%.

INDIA

@India:Introduction

Background: Nonviolent resistance to British colonialism under
Mohandas GANDHI and Jawaharlal NEHRU led to independence in 1947. The
subcontinent was divided into the secular state of India and the
smaller Muslim state of Pakistan. A third war between the two
countries in 1971 resulted in East Pakistan becoming the separate
nation of Bangladesh. Fundamental concerns in India include the
ongoing dispute with Pakistan over Kashmir, massive overpopulation,
environmental degradation, extensive poverty, and ethnic strife, all
this despite impressive gains in economic investment and output.

@India:Economy

Economy - overview: India's economy encompasses traditional village
farming, modern agriculture, handicrafts, a wide range of modern
industries, and a multitude of support services. More than a third of
the population is too poor to be able to afford an adequate diet, and
market surveys indicate that fewer than 5% of all households had an
annual income equivalent to $2,300 or more in 1995-96. India's
international payments position remained strong in 1999 with adequate
foreign exchange reserves, reasonably stable exchange rates, and
booming exports of software services. Lower production of some
nonfoodgrain crops offset recovery in industrial production. Strong
demand for India's high technology exports will bolster growth in
2000.

INDIAN OCEAN

@Indian Ocean:Introduction

Background: A spring 2000 decision by the International Hydrographic
Organization delimited a fifth world ocean from the southern portions
of the Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, and Pacific Ocean. The new ocean
extends from the coast of Antarctica north to 60 degrees south
latitude which coincides with the Antarctic Treaty Limit. The Indian
Ocean remains the third-largest of the world's five oceans (after the
Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean, but larger than the Southern Ocean
and Arctic Ocean).

@Indian Ocean:Geography

Location: body of water between Africa, the Southern Ocean, Asia, and
Australia

Geographic coordinates: 20 00 S, 80 00 E

Map references: World

Area:
total: 68.556 million sq km
note: includes Andaman Sea, Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal, Great
Australian Bight, Gulf of Aden, Gulf of Oman, Mozambique Channel,
Persian Gulf, Red Sea, Strait of Malacca, and other tributary water
bodies

Area - comparative: about 5.5 times the size of the US

Coastline: 66,526 km

Climate: northeast monsoon (December to April), southwest monsoon
(June to October); tropical cyclones occur during May/June and
October/November in the northern Indian Ocean and January/February in
the southern Indian Ocean

Terrain: surface dominated by counterclockwise gyre (broad, circular
system of currents) in the southern Indian Ocean; unique reversal of
surface currents in the northern Indian Ocean; low atmospheric
pressure over southwest Asia from hot, rising, summer air results in
the southwest monsoon and southwest-to-northeast winds and currents,
while high pressure over northern Asia from cold, falling, winter air
results in the northeast monsoon and northeast-to-southwest winds and
currents; ocean floor is dominated by the Mid-Indian Ocean Ridge and
subdivided by the Southeast Indian Ocean Ridge, Southwest Indian Ocean
Ridge, and Ninetyeast Ridge

Elevation extremes:
lowest point: Java Trench -7,258 m
highest point: sea level 0 m

Natural resources: oil and gas fields, fish, shrimp, sand and gravel
aggregates, placer deposits, polymetallic nodules

Environment - current issues: endangered marine species include the
dugong, seals, turtles, and whales; oil pollution in the Arabian Sea,
Persian Gulf, and Red Sea

Geography - note: major chokepoints include Bab el Mandeb, Strait of
Hormuz, Strait of Malacca, southern access to the Suez Canal, and the
Lombok Strait

@Indian Ocean:Government

Data code: none; the US Government has not approved a standard for
hydrographic codes - see the Cross-Reference List of Hydrographic
Codes appendix

@Indian Ocean:Economy

Economy - overview: The Indian Ocean provides major sea routes
connecting the Middle East, Africa, and East Asia with Europe and the
Americas. It carries a particularly heavy traffic of petroleum and
petroleum products from the oilfields of the Persian Gulf and
Indonesia. Its fish are of great and growing importance to the
bordering countries for domestic consumption and export. Fishing
fleets from Russia, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan also exploit the
Indian Ocean, mainly for shrimp and tuna. Large reserves of
hydrocarbons are being tapped in the offshore areas of Saudi Arabia,
Iran, India, and western Australia. An estimated 40% of the world's
offshore oil production comes from the Indian Ocean. Beach sands rich
in heavy minerals and offshore placer deposits are actively exploited
by bordering countries, particularly India, South Africa, Indonesia,
Sri Lanka, and Thailand.

INDONESIA

@Indonesia:Introduction

Background: The world's largest archipelago, Indonesia achieved
independence from the Netherlands in 1949. Current issues include:
implementing IMF-mandated reforms of the banking sector, effecting a
transition to a popularly elected government after years of rule by
dictators, addressing charges of cronyism and corruption among the
Chinese-dominated business class, dealing with alleged human rights
violations by the military, and resolving growing pressures for some
form of autonomy or independence in certain regions such as Aceh and
Irian Jaya. On 30 August 1999 a provincial referendum for independence
was overwhelmingly approved by the people of Timor Timur. Concurrence
followed by Indonesia's national legislature, and the name East Timor
was provisionally adopted. The independent status of East Timor has
yet to be formally established.

@Indonesia:Economy

Economy - overview: The Indonesian economy stabilized in 1999,
following the sharp contraction and high inflation of 1998. By
following tight monetary policy, the government reduced inflation from
over 70% in 1998 to 2% in 1999. Although interest rates spiked as high
as 70% in response to the monetary contraction, they fell rapidly to
the 10% to 15% range. The economy stopped its free-fall as GDP showed
some growth in the second half of 1999, although GDP for the year as a
whole showed no growth. The government managed to recapitalize a
handful of private banks and has begun recapitalizing the state-owned
banking sector. New lending, however, remains almost unavailable as
banks continue to be wary of issuing new debt in an environment where
little progress has been made in restructuring the huge burden of
outstanding debts. IMF payments were suspended late in 1999 as the
result of evidence that a private bank had illegally funneled payments
it received from the government to one of the political parties. The
government has forecast growth of 3.8% for FY00/01. The spread of
sectarian violence and continuing dissatisfaction with the pace of
bank and debt restructuring will make it difficult for Indonesia to
attract the private investment necessary to achieve this goal.

IRAN

@Iran:Introduction

Background: Known as Persia until 1935, Iran became an Islamic
republic in 1979 after the ruling shah was forced into exile.
Conservative clerical forces subsequently crushed westernizing liberal
elements. Militant Iranian students seized the US Embassy in Tehran on
4 November 1979 and held it until 20 January 1981. During 1980-88,
Iran fought a bloody, indecisive war with Iraq over disputed
territory. The key current issue is how rapidly the country should
open up to the modernizing influences of the outside world.

@Iran:Economy

Economy - overview: Iran's economy is a mixture of central planning,
state ownership of oil and other large enterprises, village
agriculture, and small-scale private trading and service ventures.
President KHATAMI has continued to follow the market reform plans of
former President RAFSANJANI and has indicated that he will pursue
diversification of Iran's oil-reliant economy although he has made
little progress toward that goal. The strong oil market in 1996 helped
ease financial pressures on Iran and allowed for Tehran's timely debt
service payments. Iran's financial situation tightened in 1997 and
deteriorated further in 1998 because of lower oil prices. The
subsequent zoom in oil prices in 1999 afforded Iran fiscal breathing
room but does not solve Iran's structural economic problems.

IRAQ

@Iraq:Introduction

Background: Formerly part of the Ottoman Empire, Iraq became an
independent kingdom in 1932. A "republic" was proclaimed in 1958, but
in actuality a series of military strongmen have ruled the country
since then, the latest being SADDAM Husayn. Territorial disputes with
Iran led to an inconclusive and costly eight-year war (1980-1988). In
August 1990 Iraq seized Kuwait, but was expelled by US-led, UN
coalition forces during January-February 1991. The victors did not
occupy Iraq, however, thus allowing the regime to stay in control.
Following Kuwait's liberation, the UN Security Council (UNSC) required
Iraq to scrap all weapons of mass destruction and long-range missiles
and to allow UN verification inspections. UN trade sanctions remain in
effect due to incomplete Iraqi compliance with relevant UNSC
resolutions.

@Iraq:Economy

Economy - overview: Iraq's economy is dominated by the oil sector,
which has traditionally provided about 95% of foreign exchange
earnings. In the 1980s, financial problems caused by massive
expenditures in the eight-year war with Iran and damage to oil export
facilities by Iran led the government to implement austerity measures,
borrow heavily, and later reschedule foreign debt payments; Iraq
suffered economic losses of at least $100 billion from the war. After
the end of hostilities in 1988, oil exports gradually increased with
the construction of new pipelines and restoration of damaged
facilities. Iraq's seizure of Kuwait in August 1990, subsequent
international economic sanctions, and damage from military action by
an international coalition beginning in January 1991 drastically
reduced economic activity. The government's policies of supporting
large military and internal security forces and of allocating
resources to key supporters of the regime have exacerbated shortages.
The implementation of the UN's oil-for-food program in December 1996
has helped improve economic conditions. For the first six six-month
phases of the program, Iraq was allowed to export limited amounts of
oil in exchange for food, medicine, and other humanitarian goods. In
December 1999, the UN Security Council authorized Iraq to export under
the oil-for-food program as much oil as required to meet humanitarian
needs. Oil exports are now about three-quarters their prewar level.
Per capita food imports have increased significantly, while medical
supplies and health care services are steadily improving. Per capita
output and living standards are still well below the prewar level, but
any estimates have a wide range of error.

@Ireland:Economy

Economy - overview: Ireland is a small, modern, trade-dependent
economy with growth averaging a robust 9% in 1995-99. Agriculture,
once the most important sector, is now dwarfed by industry, which
accounts for 39% of GDP and about 80% of exports and employs 28% of
the labor force. Although exports remain the primary engine for
Ireland's robust growth, the economy is also benefiting from a rise in
consumer spending and recovery in both construction and business
investment. Over the past decade, the Irish government has implemented
a series of national economic programs designed to curb inflation,
reduce government spending, and promote foreign investment. The
unemployment rate has been halved; job creation remains a primary
concern of government policy. Recent efforts have concentrated on
improving workers' qualifications and the education system. Ireland
joined in launching the euro currency system in January 1999 along
with 10 other EU nations. The construction and other sectors are
beginning to press against capacity, and growth is expected to drop in
2000, perhaps by 1 percentage point.

ISRAEL

@Israel:Introduction

Background: Following World War II, the British withdrew from their
mandate of Palestine, and the UN partitioned the area into Arab and
Jewish states, an arrangement rejected by the Arabs. Subsequently, the
Israelis defeated the Arabs in a series of wars without ending the
deep tensions between the two sides. The territories occupied by
Israel since the 1967 war are not included in the Isreal country
profile, unless otherwise noted. In keeping with the framework
established at the Madrid Conference in October 1991, bilateral
negotiations are being conducted between Israel and Palestinian
representatives (from the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip)
and Israel and Syria, to achieve a permanent settlement. On 25 April
1982, Israel withdrew from the Sinai pursuant to the 1979 Israel-Egypt
Peace Treaty. Outstanding territorial and other disputes with Jordan
were resolved in the 26 October 1994 Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace.

@Israel:Economy

Economy - overview: Israel has a technologically advanced market
economy with substantial government participation. It depends on
imports of crude oil, grains, raw materials, and military equipment.
Despite limited natural resources, Israel has intensively developed
its agricultural and industrial sectors over the past 20 years. Israel
is largely self-sufficient in food production except for grains.
Diamonds, high-technology equipment, and agricultural products (fruits
and vegetables) are leading exports. Israel usually posts sizable
current account deficits, which are covered by large transfer payments
from abroad and by foreign loans. Roughly half of the government's
external debt is owed to the US, which is its major source of economic
and military aid. The influx of Jewish immigrants from the former USSR
topped 750,000 during the period 1989-99, bringing the population of
Israel from the former Soviet Union to 1 million, one-sixth of the
total population, and adding scientific and professional expertise of
substantial value for the economy's future. The influx, coupled with
the opening of new markets at the end of the Cold War, energized
Israel's economy, which grew rapidly in the early 1990s. But growth
began slowing in 1996 when the government imposed tighter fiscal and
monetary policies and the immigration bonus petered out. Those
policies brought inflation down to record low levels in 1999 and,
coupled with improved prospects for the Middle East peace process, are
creating a climate for stronger GDP growth in the year 2000.

ITALY

@Italy:Introduction

Background: Italy became a nation-state belatedly - in 1861 when the
city-states of the peninsula and Sicily were united under King Victor
EMMANUEL. The Fascist dictatorship of Benito MUSSOLINI that took over
after World War I led to a disastrous alliance with Nazi Germany and
Italian defeat in World War II. Revival followed. Italy was a charter
member of NATO and the European Economic Community (EEC) and joined
the growing political and economic unification of Western Europe,
including the introduction of the euro in 1999. Persistent problems
include illegal immigration, the ravages of organized crime,
corruption, high unemployment, and the low incomes and technical
standards of southern Italy compared with the more prosperous north.

@Italy:Economy

Economy - overview: Italy has a diversified industrial economy with
approximately the same total and per capita output as France and the
UK. This capitalistic economy remains divided into a developed
industrial north, dominated by private companies, and a less developed
agricultural south, with more than 20% unemployment. Most raw
materials needed by industry and more than 75% of energy requirements
are imported. For several years Italy has adopted budgets compliant
with the requirements of the European Monetary Union (EMU);
representatives of government, labor, and employers also agreed to an
update of the 1993 "social pact," which has been widely credited with
having brought Italy's inflation into conformity with EMU
requirements. Italy must work to stimulate employment, promote wage
flexibility, hold down the growth in pensions, and tackle the informal
economy. Growth was 1.3% in 1999 and should edge up to 2.6% in 2000,
led by investment and exports.

@Jamaica:Economy

Economy - overview: Key sectors in this island economy are bauxite
(alumina and bauxite account for more than half of exports) and
tourism. Since assuming office in 1992, Prime Minister PATTERSON has
eliminated most price controls, streamlined tax schedules, and
privatized government enterprises. Continued tight monetary and fiscal
policies have helped slow inflation - although inflationary pressures
are mounting - and stabilize the exchange rate, but have resulted in
the slowdown of economic growth (moving from 1.5% in 1992 to 0.5% in
1995). In 1996, GDP showed negative growth (-1.4%) and remained
negative through 1999. Serious problems include: high interest rates;
increased foreign competition; the weak financial condition of
business in general resulting in receiverships or closures and
downsizings of companies; the shift in investment portfolios to
non-productive, short-term high yield instruments; a pressured,
sometimes sliding, exchange rate; a widening merchandise trade
deficit; and a growing internal debt for government bailouts to
various ailing sectors of the economy, particularly the financial
sector. Depressed economic conditions in 1999 led to increased civil
unrest, including a mounting crime rate. Jamaica's medium-term
prospects will depend upon encouraging investment in the productive
sectors, maintaining a competitive exchange rate, stabilizing the
labor environment, selling off reacquired firms, and implementing
proper fiscal and monetary policies.

JAPAN

@Japan:Introduction

Background: While retaining its time-honored culture, Japan rapidly
absorbed Western technology during the late 19th and early 20th
centuries. After its devastating defeat in World War II, Japan
recovered to become the second most powerful economy in the world and
a staunch ally of the US. While the emperor retains his throne as a
symbol of national unity, actual power rests in networks of powerful
politicians, bureaucrats, and business executives. The economy
experienced a major slowdown in the 1990s following three decades of
unprecedented growth.

@Japan:Economy

Economy - overview: Government-industry cooperation, a strong work
ethic, mastery of high technology, and a comparatively small defense
allocation (1% of GDP) have helped Japan advance with extraordinary
rapidity to the rank of second most technologically powerful economy
in the world after the US and third largest economy in the world after
the US and China. One notable characteristic of the economy is the
working together of manufacturers, suppliers, and distributors in
closely knit groups called keiretsu. A second basic feature has been
the guarantee of lifetime employment for a substantial portion of the
urban labor force. Both features are now eroding. Industry, the most
important sector of the economy, is heavily dependent on imported raw
materials and fuels. The much smaller agricultural sector is highly
subsidized and protected, with crop yields among the highest in the
world. Usually self-sufficient in rice, Japan must import about 50% of
its requirements of other grain and fodder crops. Japan maintains one
of the world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of
the global catch. For three decades overall real economic growth had
been spectacular: a 10% average in the 1960s, a 5% average in the
1970s, and a 4% average in the 1980s. Growth slowed markedly in
1992-95 largely because of the aftereffects of overinvestment during
the late 1980s and contractionary domestic policies intended to wring
speculative excesses from the stock and real estate markets. Growth
picked up to 3.9% in 1996, largely a reflection of stimulative fiscal
and monetary policies as well as low rates of inflation. But in
1997-98 Japan experienced a wrenching recession, centered about
financial difficulties in the banking system and real estate markets
and exacerbated by rigidities in corporate structures and labor
markets. In 1999 output started to stabilize as emergency government
spending began to take hold and business confidence gradually
improved. The crowding of habitable land area and the aging of the
population are two major long-run problems. Robotics constitutes a key
long-term economic strength, with Japan possessing 410,000 of the
world's 720,000 "working robots".

@Jersey:Economy

Economy - overview: The economy is based largely on international
financial services, agriculture, and tourism. Potatoes, cauliflower,
tomatoes, and especially flowers are important export crops, shipped
mostly to the UK. The Jersey breed of dairy cattle is known worldwide
and represents an important export income earner. Milk products go to
the UK and other EU countries. In 1996 the finance sector accounted
for about 60% of the island's output. Tourism, another mainstay of the
economy, accounts for 24% of GDP. In recent years, the government has
encouraged light industry to locate in Jersey, with the result that an
electronics industry has developed alongside the traditional
manufacturing of knitwear. All raw material and energy requirements
are imported, as well as a large share of Jersey's food needs. Light
taxes and death duties make the island a popular tax haven.

@Jordan:Introduction

Background: For most of its history since independence from British
administration in 1946, Jordan was ruled by King HUSSEIN (1953-1999).
A pragmatic ruler, he successfully navigated competing pressures from
the major powers (US, USSR, and UK), various Arab states, Israel, and
a large internal Palestinian population, through several wars and coup
attempts. In 1989 he resumed parliamentary elections and gradually
permitted political liberalization; in 1994 a formal peace treaty was
signed with Israel.

@Jordan:Economy

Economy - overview: Jordan is a small Arab country with inadequate
supplies of water and other natural resources such as oil. The Persian
Gulf crisis, which began in August 1990, aggravated Jordan's already
serious economic problems, forcing the government to shelve the IMF
program, stop most debt payments, and suspend rescheduling
negotiations. Aid from Gulf Arab states, worker remittances, and trade
contracted; and refugees flooded the country, producing serious
balance-of-payments problems, stunting GDP growth, and straining
government resources. The economy rebounded in 1992, largely due to
the influx of capital repatriated by workers returning from the Gulf.
After averaging 9% in 1992-95, GDP growth averaged only 2% during
1996-99. In an attempt to spur growth, King ABDALLAH has undertaken
limited economic reform, including partial privatization of some state
owned enterprises and Jordan's entry in January 2000 into the World
Trade Organization (WTrO). Debt, poverty, and unemployment are
fundamental ongoing economic problems.

KAZAKHSTAN

@Kazakhstan:Introduction

Background: During the 1950s and 1960s Soviet citizens were urged to
help settle the "New Lands" of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic.
The influx of immigrants (mostly Russians, but including some deported
minority nationalities) skewed the ethnic mixture and enabled
non-Kazakhs to outnumber natives. Independence has caused many of
these newcomers to emigrate. Current issues include: resolving ethnic
differences; speeding up market reforms; establishing stable relations
with Russia, China, and other foreign powers; and developing and
expanding the country's abundant energy resources.

@Kazakhstan:Geography

Location: Central Asia, northwest of China

border countries: China 1,533 km, Kyrgyzstan 1,051 km, Russia 6,846
km, Turkmenistan 379 km, Uzbekistan 2,203 km

Coastline: 0 km (landlocked)
note: Kazakhstan borders the Aral Sea, now split into two bodies of
water (1,070 km), and the Caspian Sea (1,894 km)

Maritime claims: none (landlocked)

Climate: continental, cold winters and hot summers, arid and semiarid

Terrain: extends from the Volga to the Altai Mountains and from the
plains in western Siberia to oases and desert in Central Asia

Elevation extremes:
lowest point: Vpadina Kaundy -132 m
highest point: Khan Tangiri Shyngy (Pik Khan-Tengri) 6,995 m

Natural resources: major deposits of petroleum, natural gas, coal,
iron ore, manganese, chrome ore, nickel, cobalt, copper, molybdenum,
lead, zinc, bauxite, gold, uranium

other: 16% (1996 est.)

Irrigated land: 22,000 sq km (1996 est.)

Natural hazards: earthquakes in the south, mud slides around Almaty

Environment - current issues: radioactive or toxic chemical sites
associated with its former defense industries and test ranges are
found throughout the country and pose health risks for humans and
animals; industrial pollution is severe in some cities; because the
two main rivers which flowed into the Aral Sea have been diverted for
irrigation, it is drying up and leaving behind a harmful layer of
chemical pesticides and natural salts; these substances are then
picked up by the wind and blown into noxious dust storms; pollution in
the Caspian Sea; soil pollution from overuse of agricultural chemicals
and salination from poor infrastructure and wasteful irrigation
practices

@Kazakhstan:Economy

Economy - overview: Kazakhstan, the second largest of the former
Soviet republics in territory, possesses enormous untapped fossil fuel
reserves as well as plentiful supplies of other minerals and metals.
It also has considerable agricultural potential with its vast steppe
lands accommodating both livestock and grain production. Kazakhstan's
industrial sector rests on the extraction and processing of these
natural resources and also on a relatively large machine building
sector specializing in construction equipment, tractors, agricultural
machinery, and some defense items. The breakup of the USSR and the
collapse of demand for Kazakhstan's traditional heavy industry
products have resulted in a sharp contraction of the economy since
1991, with the steepest annual decline occurring in 1994. In 1995-97
the pace of the government program of economic reform and
privatization quickened, resulting in a substantial shifting of assets
into the private sector. The December 1996 signing of the Caspian
Pipeline Consortium agreement to build a new pipeline from western
Kazakhstan's Tengiz oil field to the Black Sea increases prospects for
substantially larger oil exports in several years. Kazakhstan's
economy turned downward in 1998 with a 2.5% decline in GDP growth due
to slumping oil prices and the August financial crisis in Russia. A
bright spot in 1999 was the recovery of international oil prices,
which, combined with a well-timed tenge devaluation and a bumper grain
harvest, pulled the economy out of recession.

@Kenya:Economy

Economy - overview: Kenya is well placed to serve as an engine of
growth in East Africa, but its economy is stagnating because of poor
management and uneven commitment to reform. In 1993, the government of
Kenya implemented a program of economic liberalization and reform that
included the removal of import licensing, price controls, and foreign
exchange controls. With the support of the World Bank, IMF, and other
donors, the reforms led to a brief turnaround in economic performance
following a period of negative growth in the early 1990s. Kenya's real
GDP grew 5% in 1995 and 4% in 1996, and inflation remained under
control. Growth slowed in 1997-99 however. Political violence damaged
the tourist industry, and Kenya's Enhanced Structural Adjustment
Program lapsed due to the government's failure to maintain reform or
address public sector corruption. A new economic team was put in place
in 1999 to revitalize the reform effort, strengthen the civil service,
and curb corruption, but wary donors continue to question the
government's commitment to sound economic policy. Long-term barriers
to development include electricity shortages, the government's
continued and inefficient dominance of key sectors, endemic
corruption, and the country's high population growth rate.

@Kiribati:Introduction

Background: The Gilbert Islands were granted self-rule by the UK in
1971 and complete independence in 1979 under the new name of Kiribati.
The US relinquished all claims to the sparsely inhabited Phoenix and
Line Island groups in a 1979 treaty of friendship with Kiribati.

@Kiribati:Geography

Location: Oceania, group of islands in the Pacific Ocean, straddling
the equator, about one-half of the way from Hawaii to Australia; note

@Kiribati:Economy

Economy - overview: A remote country of 33 scattered coral atolls,
Kiribati has few national resources. Commercially viable phosphate
deposits were exhausted at the time of independence from the UK in
1979. Copra and fish now represent the bulk of production and exports.
The economy has fluctuated widely in recent years. Economic
development is constrained by a shortage of skilled workers, weak
infrastructure, and remoteness from international markets. Tourism
provides more than one-fifth of GDP. The financial sector is at an
early stage of development as is the expansion of private sector
initiatives. Foreign financial aid, largely from the UK and Japan, is
a critical supplement to GDP, equal to 25%-50% of GDP in recent years.
Remittances from workers abroad account for more than $5 million each
year.

@Korea:Economy

Economy - overview: North Korea ranks among the world's most centrally
planned and isolated economies. The resulting economic distortions and
the government's reluctance to publicize economic data limit the
amount of reliable information available. State-owned industry
produces nearly all manufactured goods, and the regime continues to
devote its focus on heavy and military industries at the expense of
light and consumer industries. Economic conditions remain stagnant at
best and the country's deepening economic slide has been fueled by
acute energy shortages, poorly maintained and aging industrial
facilities, and a lack of new investment. The agricultural outlook,
though slightly improved over previous years, remains weak. The
combined effects of serious fertilizer shortages, successive natural
disasters, and structural constraints - such as marginal arable land
and a short growing season - have reduced staple grain output to more
than 1 million tons less than what the country needs to meet even
minimum international requirements. The steady flow of international
food aid has been critical in meeting the population's basic food
needs. The impact of other forms of humanitarian assistance such as
medical supplies and agricultural assistance largely has been limited
to local areas. Even with aid, malnutrition rates are among the
world's highest and estimates of mortality range in the hundreds of
thousands as a direct result of starvation or famine-related diseases.

@Kuwait:Economy

Economy - overview: Kuwait is a small, relatively open economy with
proved crude oil reserves of about 94 billion barrels - 10% of world
reserves. Petroleum accounts for nearly half of GDP, 90% of export
revenues, and 75% of government income. Kuwait lacks water and has
practically no arable land, thus preventing development of
agriculture. With the exception of fish, it depends almost wholly on
food imports. About 75% of potable water must be distilled or
imported. Higher oil prices reduced the budget deficit from $5.5
billion to $3 billion in 1999, and prices are expected to remain
relatively strong throughout 2000. The government is proceeding slowly
with reforms. It inaugurated Kuwait's first free-trade zone in 1999
and will continue discussions with foreign oil companies to develop
fields in the northern part of the country.

@Kyrgyzstan:Economy

Economy - overview: Kyrgyzstan is a small, poor, mountainous country
with a predominantly agricultural economy. Cotton, wool, and meat are
the main agricultural products and exports. Industrial exports include
gold, mercury, uranium, and electricity. Kyrgyzstan has been one of
the most progressive countries of the former Soviet Union in carrying
out market reforms. Following a successful stabilization program,
which lowered inflation from 88% in 1994 to 15% for 1997, attention is
turning toward stimulating growth. Much of the government's stock in
enterprises has been sold. Drops in production had been severe since
the breakup of the Soviet Union in December 1991, but by mid-1995
production began to recover and exports began to increase. Pensioners,
unemployed workers, and government workers with salary arrears
continue to suffer. Foreign assistance played a substantial role in
the country's economic turnaround in 1996-97. The government has
adopted a series of measures to combat such severe problems as
excessive external debt, inflation, inadequate revenue collection, and
the spillover from Russia's economic disorders. Kyrgyzstan had
moderate growth in 1999 of 3.4% with a similar rate expected for 2000.

@Laos:Economy

Economy - overview: The government of Laos - one of the few remaining
official communist states - began decentralizing control and
encouraging private enterprise in 1986. The results, starting from an
extremely low base, were striking - growth averaged 7% in 1988-96.
Since mid-1996, however, reform efforts have slowed, and the economy
has suffered as a result. Because Laos depends heavily on its trade
with Thailand, it was further damaged by the regional financial crisis
beginning in 1997. From June 1997 to June 1999 the Lao kip lost 87%,
and reached a crisis point in September 1999 when it fluctuated
wildly, falling from 3,500 kip to the dollar to 9,000 kip to the
dollar in a matter of weeks. Now that the currency has stabilized,
however, the government seems content to let the current situation
persist, despite 140% inflation in 1999 and limited foreign exchange
reserves. A landlocked country with a primitive infrastructure, Laos
has no railroads, a rudimentary road system, and limited external and
internal telecommunications. Electricity is available in only a few
urban areas. Subsistence agriculture accounts for half of GDP and
provides 80% of total employment. For the foreseeable future the
economy will continue to depend on aid from the IMF and other
international sources; Japan is currently the largest bilateral aid
donor; aid from the former USSR/Eastern Europe has been cut sharply.
As in many developing countries, deforestation and soil erosion will
hamper efforts to attain a high rate of GDP growth.

1999 to begin accession talks in early 2000. Unemployment reached 9.6%
in 1999, up from 9.2% in 1998 and 6.7% in 1997. Privatization of large
state-owned utilities, especially the energy sector, faced more delays
in 1999, but is expected to accelerate in the next two years. Latvia
projects 3.5% GDP growth, 3% inflation, and a 2% fiscal deficit in

LEBANON

@Lebanon:Introduction

Background: Lebanon has made progress toward rebuilding its political
institutions and regaining its national sovereignty since 1991 and the
end of the devastating 16-year civil war. Under the Ta'if Accord - the
blueprint for national reconciliation - the Lebanese have established
a more equitable political system, particularly by giving Muslims a
greater say in the political process while institutionalizing
sectarian divisions in the government. Since the end of the war, the
Lebanese have conducted several successful elections, most of the
militias have been weakened or disbanded, and the Lebanese Armed
Forces (LAF) have extended central government authority over about
two-thirds of the country. Hizballah, the radical Shi'a party, retains
its weapons. Foreign forces still occupy areas of Lebanon. Israel
maintains troops in southern Lebanon and continues to support a proxy
militia, the Army of South Lebanon (ASL), along a narrow stretch of
territory contiguous to its border. Syria maintains about 25,000
troops in Lebanon based mainly in Beirut, North Lebanon, and the Bekaa
Valley. Syria's troop deployment was legitimized by the Arab League
during Lebanon's civil war and in the Ta'if Accord. Damascus justifies
its continued military presence in Lebanon by citing the continued
weakness of the LAF, Beirut's requests, and the failure of the
Lebanese Government to implement all of the constitutional reforms in
the Ta'if Accord.

@Lebanon:Economy

Economy - overview: The 1975-91 civil war seriously damaged Lebanon's
economic infrastructure, cut national output by half, and all but
ended Lebanon's position as a Middle Eastern entrepot and banking hub.
Peace has enabled the central government to restore control in Beirut,
begin collecting taxes, and regain access to key port and government
facilities. Economic recovery has been helped by a financially sound
banking system and resilient small- and medium-scale manufacturers,
with family remittances, banking services, manufactured and farm
exports, and international aid as the main sources of foreign
exchange. Lebanon's economy has made impressive gains since the launch
of "Horizon 2000," the government's $20 billion reconstruction program
in 1993. Real GDP grew 8% in 1994 and 7% in 1995 before Israel's
Operation Grapes of Wrath in April 1996 stunted economic activity.
Real GDP grew at an average annual rate of less than 3% per year for
1997 and 1998 and only 1% in 1999. During 1992-98, annual inflation
fell from more than 100% to 5%, and foreign exchange reserves jumped
to more than $6 billion from $1.4 billion. Burgeoning capital inflows
have generated foreign payments surpluses, and the Lebanese pound has
remained relatively stable. Progress also has been made in rebuilding
Lebanon's war-torn physical and financial infrastructure. Solidere, a
$2-billion firm, is managing the reconstruction of Beirut's central
business district; the stock market reopened in January 1996; and
international banks and insurance companies are returning. The
government nonetheless faces serious challenges in the economic arena.
It has had to fund reconstruction by tapping foreign exchange reserves
and boosting borrowing. Reducing the government budget deficit is a
major goal of the LAHUD government. The stalled peace process and
ongoing violence in southern Lebanon could lead to wider hostilities
that would disrupt vital capital inflows. Furthermore, the gap between
rich and poor has widened in the 1990's, resulting in grassroots
dissatisfaction over the skewed distribution of the reconstruction's
benefits and leading the government to shift its focus from rebuilding
infrastructure to improving living conditions.

@Lesotho:Economy

Economy - overview: Small, landlocked, and mountainous, Lesotho's only
important natural resource is water. Its economy is based on
subsistence agriculture, livestock, and remittances from miners
employed in South Africa. The number of such mine workers has declined
steadily over the past several years. In 1996 their remittances added
about 33% to GDP compared with the addition of roughly 67% in 1990. A
small manufacturing base depends largely on farm products which
support the milling, canning, leather, and jute industries.
Agricultural products are exported primarily to South Africa. Proceeds
from membership in a common customs union with South Africa form the
majority of government revenue. Although drought has decreased
agricultural activity over the past few years, completion of a major
hydropower facility in January 1998 now permits the sale of water to
South Africa, generating royalties that will be an important source of
income for Lesotho. The pace of parastatal privatization has increased
in recent years. Civil disorder in September 1998 destroyed 80% of the
commercial infrastructure in Maseru and two other major towns. Most
firms were not covered by insurance, and the rebuilding of small and
medium business has been a significant challenge in terms of both
economic growth and employment levels. Output dropped 10% in 1998 and
recovered slowly in 1999.

@Liberia:Economy

Economy - overview: A civil war in 1989-96 destroyed much of Liberia's
economy, especially the infrastructure in and around Monrovia. Many
businessmen fled the country, taking capital and expertise with them.
Some returned during 1997. Many will not return. Richly endowed with
water, mineral resources, forests, and a climate favorable to
agriculture, Liberia had been a producer and exporter of basic
products, while local manufacturing, mainly foreign owned, had been
small in scope. The democratically elected government, installed in
August 1997, inherited massive international debts and currently
relies on revenues from its maritime registry to provide the bulk of
its foreign exchange earnings. The restoration of the infrastructure
and the raising of incomes in this ravaged economy depend on the
implementation of sound macro- and micro-economic policies of the new
government, including the encouragement of foreign investment.

LIBYA

@Libya:Introduction

Background: Since he took power in a 1969 military coup, Col. Muammar
Abu Minyar al-QADHAFI has espoused his own political system - a
combination of socialism and Islam - which he calls the Third
International Theory. Viewing himself as a revolutionary leader, he
used oil funds during the 1970s and 1980s to promote his ideology
outside Libya, even supporting subversives and terrorists abroad to
hasten the end of Marxism and capitalism. Libyan military adventures
failed, e.g., the prolonged foray of Libyan troops into the Aozou
Strip in northern Chad was finally repulsed in 1987. Libyan support
for terrorism decreased after UN sanctions were imposed in 1992. Those
sanctions were suspended in April 1999.

@Libya:Economy

Economy - overview: The socialist-oriented economy depends primarily
upon revenues from the oil sector, which contributes practically all
export earnings and about one-quarter of GDP. These oil revenues and a
small population give Libya one of the highest per capita GDPs in
Africa, but little of this income flows down to the lower orders of
society. In this statist society, import restrictions and inefficient
resource allocations have led to periodic shortages of basic goods and
foodstuffs. The nonoil manufacturing and construction sectors, which
account for about 20% of GDP, have expanded from processing mostly
agricultural products to include the production of petrochemicals,
iron, steel, and aluminum. Climatic conditions and poor soils severely
limit farm output, and Libya imports about 75% of its food
requirements. Higher oil prices in 1999 led to an increase in export
revenues and helped to stimulate the economy. Following the suspension
of UN sanctions in 1999, Libya has been trying to increase its
attractiveness to foreign investors, and several foreign companies
have visited in search of contracts.

@Liechtenstein:Economy

Economy - overview: Despite its small size and limited natural
resources, Liechtenstein has developed into a prosperous, highly
industrialized, free-enterprise economy with a vital financial service
sector and living standards on a par with the urban areas of its large
European neighbors. Low business taxes - the maximum tax rate is 18% -
and easy incorporation rules have induced about 73,700 holding or
so-called letter box companies to establish nominal offices in
Liechtenstein, providing 30% of state revenues. The country
participates in a customs union with Switzerland and uses the Swiss
franc as its national currency. It imports more than 90% of its energy
requirements. Liechtenstein has been a member of the European Economic
Area (an organization serving as a bridge between European Free Trade
Association (EFTA) and EU) since May 1995. The government is working
to harmonize its economic policies with those of an integrated Europe.

@Lithuania:Economy

Economy - overview: Lithuania, the Baltic state that has conducted the
most trade with Russia, faced its own economic and financial crisis in
1999 as a result of the government's wrongfooted economic policies and
its inadequate response to the August 1998 Russian financial crisis.
Preliminary figures indicate 3% negative GDP growth, 10% unemployment
- the highest level since independence in 1991 - and a budget deficit
estimated at between 8 and 9% of GDP. The policies that Prime Minister
KUBILIUS implemented upon taking the helm in November 1999 underscore
a commitment to fiscal restraint, economic stabilization, and
accelerated reforms. The austere 2000 budget in based on a 2% GDP
growth forecast, 3% inflation, and a 2.8% budget deficit. Lithuania
was invited at the Helsinki EU summit in December 1999 to begin EU
accession talks in early 2000. Privatization of the large state-owned
utilities, particularly in the energy sector, and reducing the high
current account deficit remain challenges for the coming year.

@Luxembourg:Introduction

Background: Founded in 963, Luxembourg became a grand duchy in 1815
and an independent state under the Netherlands. It lost more than half
of its territory to Belgium in 1839, but gained a larger measure of
autonomy. Full independence was attained in 1867. Overrun by Germany
in both World Wars, it ended its neutrality in 1948 when it entered
into the Benelux Customs Union and when it joined NATO the following
year. In 1957, Luxembourg became one of the six founding countries of
the European Economic Community (later the European Union) and in 1999
it joined the euro currency area.

MACAU

@Macau:Introduction

Background: Colonized by the Portuguese in the 16th century, Macau was
the first European settlement in the Far East. Pursuant to an
agreement signed by China and Portugal on 13 April 1987, Macau became
the Macau Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China on 20 December
1999. China has promised that, under its "one country, two systems"
formula, China's socialist economic system will not be practiced in
Macau and that Macau will enjoy a high degree of autonomy in all
matters except foreign and defense affairs.

@Macau:Economy

Economy - overview: The economy is based largely on tourism (including
gambling) and textile and fireworks manufacturing. Efforts to
diversify have spawned other small industries - toys, artificial
flowers, and electronics. The tourist sector has accounted for roughly
25% of GDP, and the clothing industry has provided about three-fourths
of export earnings; the gambling industry probably represents over 40%
of GDP. Macau depends on China for most of its food, fresh water, and
energy imports. Japan and Hong Kong are the main suppliers of raw
materials and capital goods. Output dropped 4% in 1998 and the economy
remained weak in 1999. Macau reverted to Chinese administration on 20
December 1999. Gang violence, a dark spot in the economy, probably
will be reduced in 2000 to the advantage of the tourism sector.

@Madagascar:Economy

Economy - overview: Madagascar faces problems of chronic malnutrition,
underfunded health and education facilities, a roughly 3% annual
population growth rate, and severe loss of forest cover, accompanied
by erosion. Agriculture, including fishing and forestry, is the
mainstay of the economy, accounting for 34% of GDP and contributing
more than 70% to export earnings. Industry features textile
manufacturing and the processing of agricultural products. Growth in
output in 1992-97 averaged less than the growth rate of the
population. Growth has been held back by antigovernment strikes and
demonstrations, a decline in world coffee demand, and the erratic
commitment of the government to economic reform. Formidable obstacles
stand in the way of Madagascar's realizing its considerable growth
potential; the extent of government reforms, outside financial aid,
and foreign investment will be key determinants. Growth should be in
the 5% range in 2000-01.

@Malaysia:Economy

Economy - overview: Malaysia made a quick economic recovery in 1999
from its worst recession since independence in 1957. GDP grew 5%,
responding to a dynamic export sector, which grew over 10% and fiscal
stimulus from higher government spending. The large export surplus has
enabled the country to build up its already substantial financial
reserves, to $31 billion at yearend 1999. This stable macroeconomic
environment, in which both inflation and unemployment stand at 3% or
less, has made possible the relaxation of most of the capital controls
imposed by the government in 1998 to counter the impact of the Asian
financial crisis. Government and private forecasters expect Malaysia
to continue this trend in 2000, predicting GDP to grow another 5% to
6%. While Malaysia's immediate economic horizon looks bright, its
long-term prospects are clouded by the lack of reforms in the
corporate sector, particularly those dealing with competitiveness and
high corporate debt.

@Maldives:Economy

Economy - overview: Tourism, Maldives largest industry, accounts for
20% of GDP and more than 60% of the Maldives' foreign exchange
receipts. Over 90% of government tax revenue comes from import duties
and tourism-related taxes. Almost 400,000 tourists visited the islands
in 1998. Fishing is a second leading sector. The Maldivian Government
began an economic reform program in 1989 initially by lifting import
quotas and opening some exports to the private sector. Subsequently,
it has liberalized regulations to allow more foreign investment.
Agriculture and manufacturing continue to play a minor role in the
economy, constrained by the limited availability of cultivable land
and the shortage of domestic labor. Most staple foods must be
imported. Industry, which consists mainly of garment production, boat
building, and handicrafts, accounts for about 18% of GDP. Maldivian
authorities worry about the impact of erosion and possible global
warming on their low-lying country; 80% of the area is one meter or
less above sea level.

@Mali:Economy

Economy - overview: Mali is among the poorest countries in the world,
with 65% of its land area desert or semidesert. Economic activity is
largely confined to the riverine area irrigated by the Niger. About
10% of the population is nomadic and some 80% of the labor force is
engaged in farming and fishing. Industrial activity is concentrated on
processing farm commodities. Mali is heavily dependent on foreign aid
and vulnerable to fluctuations in world prices for cotton, its main
export. In 1997, the government continued its successful
implementation of an IMF-recommended structural adjustment program
that is helping the economy grow, diversify, and attract foreign
investment. Mali's adherence to economic reform, and the 50%
devaluation of the African franc in January 1994, has pushed up
economic growth. Several multinational corporations increased gold
mining operations in 1996-98, and the government anticipates that Mali
will become a major Sub-Saharan gold exporter in the next few years.
Annual growth should remain in the 5-6% range in 2000-01, and
inflation should drop under 3%.

@Malta:Economy

Economy - overview: Major resources are limestone, a favorable
geographic location, and a productive labor force. Malta produces only
about 20% of its food needs, has limited freshwater supplies, and has
no domestic energy sources. The economy is dependent on foreign trade,
manufacturing (especially electronics and textiles), and tourism; the
state-owned Malta drydocks employs about 3,800 people. In 1999, over 1
million tourists visited the island. Per capita GDP of $13,800 places
Malta in the ranks of the less affluent EU countries. The island is
divided politically over the question of joining the EU. The sizable
budget deficit remains a key concern.

@Marshall Islands:Economy

Economy - overview: US Government assistance is the mainstay of this
tiny island economy. Agricultural production is concentrated on small
farms, and the most important commercial crops are coconuts, tomatoes,
melons, and breadfruit. Small-scale industry is limited to
handicrafts, fish processing, and copra. The tourist industry, now a
small source of foreign exchange employing less than 10% of the labor
force, remains the best hope for future added income. The islands have
few natural resources, and imports far exceed exports. Under the terms
of the Compact of Free Association, the US provides roughly $65
million in annual aid. Negotiations were underway in 1999 for an
extended agreement. Government downsizing, drought, a drop in
construction, and the decline in tourism and foreign investment due to
the Asian financial difficulties caused GDP to fall in 1996-98.

@Martinique:Economy

Economy - overview: The economy is based on sugarcane, bananas,
tourism, and light industry. Agriculture accounts for about 6% of GDP
and the small industrial sector for 11%. Sugar production has
declined, with most of the sugarcane now used for the production of
rum. Banana exports are increasing, going mostly to France. The bulk
of meat, vegetable, and grain requirements must be imported,
contributing to a chronic trade deficit that requires large annual
transfers of aid from France. Tourism has become more important than
agricultural exports as a source of foreign exchange. The majority of
the work force is employed in the service sector and in
administration.

MAURITANIA

@Mauritania:Introduction

Background: Independent from France in 1960, Mauritania annexed the
southern third of the former Spanish Sahara (now Western Sahara) in
1976, but relinquished it after three years of raids by the Polisario
guerrilla front seeking independence for the territory. Opposition
parties were legalized and a new constitution approved in 1991. Two
multiparty presidential elections since then were widely seen as being
flawed; Mauritania remains, in reality, a one-party state. The country
continues to experience ethnic tensions between its black minority
population and the dominant Maur (Arab-Berber) populace.

@Mauritania:Economy

Economy - overview: A majority of the population still depends on
agriculture and livestock for a livelihood, even though most of the
nomads and many subsistence farmers were forced into the cities by
recurrent droughts in the 1970s and 1980s. Mauritania has extensive
deposits of iron ore, which account for almost 50% of total exports.
The decline in world demand for this ore, however, has led to cutbacks
in production. The nation's coastal waters are among the richest
fishing areas in the world, but overexploitation by foreigners
threatens this key source of revenue. The country's first deepwater
port opened near Nouakchott in 1986. In recent years, drought and
economic mismanagement have resulted in a buildup of foreign debt. In
March 1999, the government signed an agreement with a joint World
Bank-IMF mission on a $54 million enhanced structural adjustment
facility (ESAF). The economic objectives have been set for 1999-2002.
Privatization remains one of the key issues. Mauritania is unlikely to
meet ESAF's annual GDP growth objectives of 4%-5%.

GDP: purchasing power parity - $4.9 billion (1999 est.)

@Mauritius:Economy

Economy - overview: Since independence in 1968, Mauritius has
developed from a low income, agriculturally based economy to a middle
income diversified economy with growing industrial, financial, and
tourist sectors. For most of the period, annual growth has been of the
order of 5% to 6%. This remarkable achievement has been reflected in
increased life expectancy, lowered infant mortality, and a much
improved infrastructure. Sugarcane is grown on about 90% of the
cultivated land area and accounts for 25% of export earnings. A
record-setting drought severely damaged the sugar crop in 1999,
however. The government's development strategy centers on foreign
investment. Mauritius has attracted more than 9,000 offshore entities,
many aimed at commerce in India and South Africa, and investment in
the banking sector alone has reached over $1 billion. Economic
performance in 1991-99 continued strong with solid growth and low
unemployment.

requirements, mainly from France. The economy and future development
of the island are heavily dependent on French financial assistance, an
important supplement to GDP. Mayotte's remote location is an obstacle

MEXICO

@Mexico:Introduction

Background: The site of advanced Amerindian civilizations, Mexico came
under Spanish rule for three centuries before achieving independence
early in the 19th century. A devaluation of the peso in late 1994
threw Mexico into economic turmoil, triggering the worst recession in
over half a century. The nation continues to make an impressive
recovery. Ongoing economic and social concerns include low real wages,
underemployment for a large segment of the population, inequitable
income distribution, and few advancement opportunities for the largely
Amerindian population in the impoverished southern states.

@Mexico:Economy

Economy - overview: Mexico has a free market economy with a mixture of
modern and outmoded industry and agriculture, increasingly dominated
by the private sector. The number of state-owned enterprises in Mexico
has fallen from more than 1,000 in 1982 to fewer than 200 in 1999. The
ZEDILLO administration is privatizing and expanding competition in sea
ports, railroads, telecommunications, electricity, natural gas
distribution, and airports. A strong export sector helped to cushion
the economy's decline in 1995 and led the recovery in 1996-99. Private
consumption became the leading driver of growth, accompanied by
increased employment and higher wages. Mexico still needs to overcome
many structural problems as it strives to modernize its economy and
raise living standards. Income distribution is very unequal, with the
top 20% of income earners accounting for 55% of income. Trade with the
US and Canada has nearly doubled since NAFTA was implemented in 1994.
Mexico is pursuing additional trade agreements with most countries in
Latin America and has signed a free trade deal with the EU to lessen
its dependence on the US. The government is pursuing conservative
economic policies in 2000 to avoid another end-of-term economic
crisis, but it still projects an economic growth rate of 4.5% because
of the strong US economy and high oil prices.

@Moldova:Economy

Economy - overview: Moldova enjoys a favorable climate and good
farmland but has no major mineral deposits. As a result, the economy
depends heavily on agriculture, featuring fruits, vegetables, wine,
and tobacco. Moldova must import all of its supplies of oil, coal, and
natural gas, largely from Russia. Energy shortages contributed to
sharp production declines after the breakup of the Soviet Union in
1991. As part of an ambitious reform effort, Moldova introduced a
stable convertible currency, freed all prices, stopped issuing
preferential credits to state enterprises, backed steady land
privatization, removed export controls, and freed interest rates. Yet
these efforts could not offset the impact of political and economic
difficulties, both internal and regional. In 1998, the economic
troubles of Russia, by far Moldova's leading trade partner, were a
major cause of the 8.6% drop in GDP; the value of the currency in
relation to the dollar fell by half. In 1999, GDP fell again, by 4.4%,
the fifth drop in the past six years; exports were down, and energy
supplies continued erratic. GDP is expected to remain at about the
same level in 2000.

Economy - overview: Monaco, situated on the French Mediterranean
coast, is a popular resort, attracting tourists to its casino and
pleasant climate. The Principality has successfully sought to
diversify into services and small, high-value-added, nonpolluting
industries. The state has no income tax and low business taxes and
thrives as a tax haven both for individuals who have established
residence and for foreign companies that have set up businesses and
offices. The state retains monopolies in a number of sectors,
including tobacco, the telephone network, and the postal service.
Living standards are high, roughly comparable to those in prosperous
French metropolitan areas. Monaco does not publish national income

MONGOLIA

@Mongolia:Introduction

Background: Long a province of China, Mongolia won its independence in
1921 with Soviet backing. A communist regime was installed in 1924.
During the early 1990s, the ex-communist Mongolian People's
Revolutionary Party (MPRP) gradually yielded its monopoly on power. In
1996, the Democratic Union Coalition (DUC) defeated the MPRP in a
national election and has attempted to establish a number of reforms
to modernize the economy. However, many former communists retain key
posts and implementation has been difficult.

Environment - current issues: limited natural fresh water resources;
policies of the former communist regime promoting rapid urbanization
and industrial growth have raised concerns about their negative
effects on the environment; the burning of soft coal in power plants
and the lack of enforcement of environmental laws have severely
polluted the air in Ulaanbaatar; deforestation, overgrazing, the
converting of virgin land to agricultural production have increased
soil erosion from wind and rain; desertification and mining activities
have also had a deleterious effect on the environment

@Mongolia:Economy

Economy - overview: Economic activity traditionally has been based on
agriculture and breeding of livestock. Mongolia also has extensive
mineral deposits: copper, coal, molybdenum, tin, tungsten, and gold
account for a large part of industrial production. Soviet assistance,
at its height one-third of GDP, disappeared almost overnight in
1990-91, at the time of the dismantlement of the USSR. Mongolia was
driven into deep recession, which was prolonged by the Mongolian
People's Revolutionary Party's (MPRP) reluctance to undertake serious
economic reform. The Democratic Union Coalition (DUC) government has
embraced free-market economics, easing price controls, liberalizing
domestic and international trade, and attempting to restructure the
banking system and the energy sector. Major domestic privatization
programs have been undertaken, as well as fostering of foreign
investment through international tender of the oil distribution
company, a leading cashmere company, and banks. Reform has been held
back by the ex-communist MPRP opposition and by the political
instability brought about through four successive governments under
the DUC. Economic growth picked up in 1997-99 after stalling in 1996
due to a series of natural disasters and declines in world prices of
copper and cashmere. Public revenues and exports collapsed in 1998 and
1999 due to the repercussions of the Asian financial crisis. In August
and September 1999, the economy suffered from a temporary Russian ban
on exports of oil and oil products. Mongolia joined the World Trade
Organization (WTrO) in 1997. The international donor community pledged
over $300 million per year at the last Consultative Group Meeting,
held in Ulaanbaatar in June 1999.

@Montserrat:Economy

Economy - overview: Severe volcanic activity, which began in July
1995, put a damper on this small, open economy throughout 1996-99. A
catastrophic eruption in June 1997 closed the air and sea ports,
causing further economic and social dislocation. Two-thirds of the
12,000 inhabitants fled the island. Some began to return in 1998, but
lack of housing limited the number. The agriculture sector continued
to be affected by the lack of suitable land for farming and the
destruction of crops. Construction was the dominant activity in 1997
and 1998. GDP declined again in 1998. Prospects for the economy depend
largely on developments in relation to the volcano and on public
sector construction activity. The UK committed about $100 million in
1996-98 to help reconstruct the economy and has programmed additional
aid for 1999-2001.

@Morocco:Economy

Economy - overview: Morocco faces the problems typical of developing
countries - restraining government spending, reducing constraints on
private activity and foreign trade, and achieving sustainable economic
growth. Since the early 1980s the government has pursued an economic
program toward these objectives with the support of the IMF, the World
Bank, and the Paris Club of creditors. The dirham is now fully
convertible for current account transactions; reforms of the financial
sector have been implemented; and state enterprises are being
privatized. Drought conditions depressed activity in the key
agricultural sector, and contributed to an economic slowdown in 1999.
Favorable rainfalls have led Morocco to predict a growth of 6% for
2000. Formidable long-term challenges include: servicing the external
debt; preparing the economy for freer trade with the EU; and improving
education and attracting foreign investment to improve living
standards and job prospects for Morocco's youthful population.

MOZAMBIQUE

@Mozambique:Introduction

Background: Almost five centuries as a Portuguese colony came to a
close with independence in 1975. Large-scale emigration by whites,
economic dependence on South Africa, a severe drought, and a prolonged
civil war hindered the country's development. The ruling party
formally abandoned Marxism in 1989, and a new constitution the
following year provided for multiparty elections and a free market
economy. A UN-negotiated peace agreement with rebel forces ended the
fighting in 1992.

@Mozambique:Economy

Economy - overview: Before the peace accord of October 1992,
Mozambique's economy was devastated by a protracted civil war and
socialist mismanagement. In 1994, it ranked as one of the poorest
countries in the world. Since then, Mozambique has undertaken a series
of economic reforms. Almost all aspects of the economy have been
liberalized to some extent. More than 900 state enterprises have been
privatized. Pending are tax and much needed commercial code reform, as
well as greater private sector involvement in the transportation,
telecommunications, and energy sectors. Since 1996, inflation has been
low and foreign exchange rates stable. Albeit from a small base,
Mozambique's economy grew at an annual 10% rate in 1997-99, one of the
highest growth rates in the world. Still, the country depends on
foreign assistance to balance the budget and to pay for a trade
imbalance in which imports outnumber exports by five to one or more.
The medium-term outlook for the country looks bright, as trade and
transportation links to South Africa and the rest of the region are
expected to improve and sizable foreign investments materialize. Among
these investments are metal production (aluminum, steel), natural gas,
power generation, agriculture (cotton, sugar), fishing, timber, and
transportation services. Additional exports in these areas should
bring in needed foreign exchange. In addition, Mozambique is on track
to receive a formal cancellation of a large portion of its external
debt through a World Bank initiative.

@Namibia:Economy

Economy - overview: The economy is heavily dependent on the extraction
and processing of minerals for export. Mining accounts for 20% of GDP.
Namibia is the fourth-largest exporter of nonfuel minerals in Africa
and the world's fifth-largest producer of uranium. Rich alluvial
diamond deposits make Namibia a primary source for gem-quality
diamonds. Namibia also produces large quantities of lead, zinc, tin,
silver, and tungsten. Half of the population depends on agriculture
(largely subsistence agriculture) for its livelihood. Namibia must
import some of its food. Although per capita GDP is four times the per
capita GDP of Africa's poorer countries, the majority of Namibia's
people live in pronounced poverty because of large-scale unemployment,
the great inequality of income distribution, and the large amount of
wealth going to foreigners. The Namibian economy has close links to
South Africa. GDP growth should improve in 2000-01, because of gains
in the diamond and fish sectors. Agreement has been reached on the
privatization of several more enterprises in coming years, which
should stimulate long-run foreign investment.

NAURU

@Nauru:Introduction

Background: Nauru's phosphate deposits began to be mined early in the
20th century by a German-British consortium; the island was occupied
by Australian forces in World War I. Upon achieving independence in
1968, Nauru became the smallest independent republic in the world; it
joined the UN in 1999.

@Nauru:Economy

Economy - overview: Revenues of this tiny island come from exports of
phosphates, but reserves are expected to be exhausted in the year
2000. Phosphates have given Nauruans one of the highest per capita
incomes in the Third World, with estimates of GDP varying widely. Few
other resources exist, thus most necessities must be imported,
including fresh water from Australia. The rehabilitation of mined land
and the replacement of income from phosphates are serious long-term
problems. Substantial amounts of phosphate income are invested in
trust funds to help cushion the transition. The government also has
been borrowing heavily from the trusts to finance fiscal deficits. To
cut costs the government has called for a freezing of wages, a
reduction of over-staffed public service departments, privatization of
numerous government agencies, and closure of some overseas consulates.
In recent years Nauru has encouraged the registration of offshore
banks and corporations. Tens of billions of dollars have been
channeled through their accounts.

@Netherlands Antilles:Economy

Economy - overview: Tourism, petroleum transshipment, and offshore
finance are the mainstays of this small economy, which is closely tied
to the outside world. The islands enjoy a high per capita income and a

@Netherlands:Economy

Economy - overview: The Netherlands is a prosperous and open economy
in which the government has successfully reduced its role since the
1980s. Industrial activity is predominantly in food processing,
chemicals, petroleum refining, and electrical machinery. A highly
mechanized agricultural sector employs no more than 4% of the labor
force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry
and for exports. The Dutch rank third worldwide in value of
agricultural exports, behind the US and France. The Netherlands
successfully addressed the issue of public finances and stagnating job
growth long before its European partners. This has helped cushion the
economy from a slowdown in the euro area. Strong 3.8% GDP growth in
1998 was followed by an only slightly lower 3.4% expansion in 1999.
The outlook remains favorable, with real GDP growth in 2000 projected
at 3.25%, along with a small budget surplus. The Dutch were among the
first 11 EU countries establishing the euro currency zone on 1 January
1999.

@New Caledonia:Economy

Economy - overview: New Caledonia has more than 20% of the world's
known nickel resources. In recent years, the economy has suffered
because of depressed international demand for nickel, the principal
source of export earnings. Only a negligible amount of the land is
suitable for cultivation, and food accounts for about 20% of imports.
In addition to nickel, the substantial financial support from France
and tourism are keys to the health of the economy. The situation in
1998 was clouded by the spillover of financial problems in East Asia
and by lower prices for nickel. Nickel prices jumped in 1999, and
large additions were made to capacity.

@New Zealand:Economy

Economy - overview: Since 1984 the government has accomplished major
economic restructuring, moving an agrarian economy dependent on
concessionary British market access toward a more industrialized, free
market economy that can compete globally. This dynamic growth has
boosted real incomes, broadened and deepened the technological
capabilities of the industrial sector, and contained inflationary
pressures. Inflation remains among the lowest in the industrial world.
Per capita GDP has been moving up toward the levels of the big West
European economies. New Zealand's heavy dependence on trade leaves its
growth prospects vulnerable to economic performance in Asia, Europe,
and the US. Moderate growth probably will characterize 2000.

NICARAGUA

@Nicaragua:Introduction

Background: Settled as a colony of Spain in the 1520s, Nicaragua
gained its independence in 1821. Violent opposition to governmental
manipulation and corruption spread to all classes by 1978 and resulted
in a short-lived civil war that brought the Marxist Sandinista
guerrillas to power in 1979. Nicaraguan aid to leftist rebels in El
Salvador caused the US to sponsor anti-Sandinista contra guerrillas
through much of the 1980s. Free elections in 1990 and again in 1996
saw the Sandinistas defeated. The country has slowly rebuilt its
economy during the 1990s, but was hard hit by Hurricane Mitch in 1998.

@Nicaragua:Economy

Economy - overview: Nicaragua is one of the hemisphere's poorest
countries, with low per capita income, flagging socio-economic
indicators, and huge external debt. The country has made significant
progress toward macro-economic stabilization over the past few years -
even with the damage caused by Hurricane Mitch in the fall of 1998.
International aid, debt relief, and continued foreign investment have
contributed to the stabilization process. GDP grew 6.3% in 1999, while
inflation remained about 12%, and unemployment dropped. Nicaragua may
qualify for the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative,
though aid is conditioned on improving governability, the openness of
government financial operations, poverty alleviation, and human
rights.

institutionalizing democracy. In addition, the OBASANJO administration
must defuse longstanding ethnic and religious tensions, if it is to
build a sound foundation for economic growth and political stability.

@Nigeria:Economy

Economy - overview: The oil-rich Nigerian economy, long hobbled by
political instability, corruption, and poor macroeconomic management,
is undergoing substantial economic reform under the new civilian
administration. Nigeria's former military rulers failed to diversify
the economy away from overdependence on the capital-intensive oil
sector, which provides 20% of GDP, 95% of foreign exchange earnings,
and about 65% of budgetary revenues. The largely subsistence
agricultural sector has not kept up with rapid population growth, and
Nigeria, once a large net exporter of food, now must import food. In
2000, Nigeria is likely to receive a debt-restructuring deal with the
Paris club and a $1 billion loan from the IMF, both contingent on
economic reforms. Increased foreign investment combined with high
world oil prices should push growth to over 5% in 2000-01.

1999 were followed by the creation of a National Reconciliation
Council that effected a transition to civilian rule in December 1999.

@Niger:Economy

Economy - overview: Niger is a poor, landlocked Sub-Saharan nation,
whose economy centers on subsistence agriculture, animal husbandry,
reexport trade, and increasingly less on uranium, its major export
since the 1970s. The 50% devaluation of the West African franc in
January 1994 boosted exports of livestock, cowpeas, onions, and the
products of Niger's small cotton industry. The government relies on
bilateral and multilateral aid - which was suspended following the
April 1999 coup d'etat - for operating expenses and public investment.
Short-term prospects depend on upcoming negotiations with the World
Bank and the IMF on debt relief and extended aid.

@Niue:Economy

Economy - overview: The economy is heavily dependent on aid and
remittances from New Zealand. Government expenditures regularly exceed
revenues, and the shortfall is made up by grants from New Zealand
which are used to pay wages to public employees. Niue has cut
government expenditures by reducing the public service by almost half.
The agricultural sector consists mainly of subsistence gardening,
although some cash crops are grown for export. Industry consists
primarily of small factories to process passion fruit, lime oil,
honey, and coconut cream. The sale of postage stamps to foreign
collectors is an important source of revenue. The island in recent
years has suffered a serious loss of population because of migration
of Niueans to New Zealand. Efforts to increase GDP include the
promotion of tourism and a financial services industry.

@Northern Mariana Islands:Introduction

Background: Under US administration as part of the UN Trust Territory
of the Pacific, the people of the Northern Mariana Islands decided in
the 1970s not to seek independence but instead to forge closer links
with the US. Negotiations for territorial status began in 1972. A
covenant to establish a commonwealth in political union with the US
was approved in 1975. A new government and constitution went into

@Northern Mariana Islands:Economy

Economy - overview: The economy benefits substantially from financial
assistance from the US. The rate of funding has declined as locally
generated government revenues have grown. An agreement for the years
1986 to 1992 entitled the islands to $228 million for capital
development, government operations, and special programs. Since 1992,
funding has been extended one year at a time. The commonwealth
received $27.7 million from FY93/94 through FY95/96. For FY96/97
through FY02/03, funding of $11 million will be provided for
infrastructure, with an equal local match. A rapidly growing chief
source of income is the tourist industry, which now employs about 50%
of the work force. Japanese tourists predominate. The agricultural
sector is of minor importance and is made up of cattle ranches and
small farms producing coconuts, breadfruit, tomatoes, and melons.
Garment production is the fastest growing industry with employment of
12,000 mostly Chinese workers and shipments of $1 billion to the US in
1998 under duty and quota exemptions.

NORWAY

@Norway:Introduction

Background: Despite its neutrality, Norway was not able to avoid
occupation by Germany in World War II. In 1949, neutrality was
abandoned and Norway became a member of NATO. Discovery of oil and gas
in adjacent waters in the late 1960s boosted Norway's economic
fortunes. The current focus is on containing spending on the extensive
welfare system and planning for the time when petroleum reserves are
depleted. In referenda held in 1972 and 1994, Norway rejected joining
the EU.

@Norway:Economy

Economy - overview: The Norwegian economy is a prosperous bastion of
welfare capitalism, featuring a combination of free market activity
and government intervention. The government controls key areas, such
as the vital petroleum sector (through large-scale state enterprises),
and extensively subsidizes agriculture, fishing, and areas with sparse
resources. The extensive welfare system helps propel public sector
expenditures to more than 50% of GDP. A major shipping nation, with a
high dependence on international trade, Norway is basically an
exporter of raw materials and semiprocessed goods. The country is
richly endowed with natural resources - petroleum, hydropower, fish,
forests, and minerals - and is highly dependent on its oil production
and international oil prices. Only Saudi Arabia exports more oil than
Norway. Norway imports more than half its food needs. Oslo opted to
stay out of the EU during a referendum in November 1994. Growth was a
meager 0.8% in 1999 because of weak private consumption and anemic
investment activity in the oil and other sectors. Growth should pick
up in 2000, perhaps to 2.7%. Despite their high per capita income and
generous welfare benefits, Norwegians worry about that time in the
next two decades when the oil and gas begin to run out.

PACIFIC OCEAN

@Pacific Ocean:Introduction

Background: A spring 2000 decision by the International Hydrographic
Organization delimited a fifth world ocean from the southern portions
of the Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, and Pacific Ocean. The new ocean
extends from the coast of Antarctica north to 60 degrees south
latitude which coincides with the Antarctic Treaty Limit. The Pacific
Ocean remains the largest of the world's five oceans (followed by the
Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Southern Ocean, and Arctic Ocean).

@Pacific Ocean:Geography

Location: body of water between the Southern Ocean, Asia, Australia,
and the Western Hemisphere

Geographic coordinates: 0 00 N, 160 00 W

Map references: World

Area:
total: 155.557 million sq km
note: includes Bali Sea, Bering Sea, Bering Strait, Coral Sea, East
China Sea, Flores Sea, Gulf of Alaska, Gulf of Tonkin, Java Sea,
Philippine Sea, Savu Sea, Sea of Japan, Sea of Okhotsk, South China
Sea, Tasman Sea, Timor Sea, and other tributary water bodies

Area - comparative: about 15 times the size of the US; covers about
28% of the global surface; larger than the total land area of the
world

Coastline: 135,663 km

Climate: planetary air pressure systems and resultant wind patterns
exhibit remarkable uniformity in the south and east; trade winds and
westerly winds are well-developed patterns, modified by seasonal
fluctuations; tropical cyclones (hurricanes) may form south of Mexico
from June to October and affect Mexico and Central America;
continental influences cause climatic uniformity to be much less
pronounced in the eastern and western regions at the same latitude in
the North Pacific Ocean; the western Pacific is monsoonal - a rainy
season occurs during the summer months, when moisture-laden winds blow
from the ocean over the land, and a dry season during the winter
months, when dry winds blow from the Asian landmass back to the ocean;
tropical cyclones (typhoons) may strike southeast and east Asia from
May to December

Terrain: surface currents in the northern Pacific are dominated by a
clockwise, warm-water gyre (broad circular system of currents) and in
the southern Pacific by a counterclockwise, cool-water gyre; in the
northern Pacific, sea ice forms in the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk
in winter; in the southern Pacific, sea ice from Antarctica reaches
its northernmost extent in October; the ocean floor in the eastern
Pacific is dominated by the East Pacific Rise, while the western
Pacific is dissected by deep trenches, including the Mariana Trench,
which is the world's deepest

Elevation extremes:
lowest point: Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench -10,924 m
highest point: sea level 0 m

Natural resources: oil and gas fields, polymetallic nodules, sand and
gravel aggregates, placer deposits, fish

Natural hazards: surrounded by a zone of violent volcanic and
earthquake activity sometimes referred to as the "Pacific Ring of
Fire"; subject to tropical cyclones (typhoons) in southeast and east
Asia from May to December (most frequent from July to October);
tropical cyclones (hurricanes) may form south of Mexico and strike
Central America and Mexico from June to October (most common in August
and September); cyclical El Nino phenomenon occurs off the coast of
Peru, when the trade winds slacken and the warm Equatorial
countercurrent moves south, killing the plankton that is the primary
food source for anchovies; consequently, the anchovies move to better
feeding grounds, causing resident marine birds to starve by the
thousands because of the loss of their food source; ships subject to
superstructure icing in extreme north from October to May; persistent
fog in the northern Pacific can be a maritime hazard from June to
December

Environment - current issues: endangered marine species include the
dugong, sea lion, sea otter, seals, turtles, and whales; oil pollution
in Philippine Sea and South China Sea

Geography - note: the major chokepoints are the Bering Strait, Panama
Canal, Luzon Strait, and the Singapore Strait; the Equator divides the
Pacific Ocean into the North Pacific Ocean and the South Pacific
Ocean; dotted with low coral islands and rugged volcanic islands in
the southwestern Pacific Ocean

@Pacific Ocean:Government

Data code: none; the US Government has not approved a standard for
hydrographic codes - see the Cross-Reference List of Hydrographic
Codes appendix

@Pacific Ocean:Economy

Economy - overview: The Pacific Ocean is a major contributor to the
world economy and particularly to those nations its waters directly
touch. It provides low-cost sea transportation between East and West,
extensive fishing grounds, offshore oil and gas fields, minerals, and
sand and gravel for the construction industry. In 1996, over 60% of
the world's fish catch came from the Pacific Ocean. Exploitation of
offshore oil and gas reserves is playing an ever-increasing role in
the energy supplies of Australia, NZ, China, US, and Peru. The high
cost of recovering offshore oil and gas, combined with the wide swings
in world prices for oil since 1985, has slowed but not stopped new
drillings.

PAKISTAN

@Pakistan:Introduction

Background: The separation in 1947 of British India into the Muslim
state of Pakistan (with two sections West and East) and largely Hindu
India was never satisfactorily resolved. A third war between these
countries in 1971 resulted in East Pakistan seceding and becoming the
separate nation of Bangladesh. A dispute over the state of Kashmir is
ongoing. In response to Indian nuclear weapons testing, Pakistan
conducted its own tests in 1998.

@Pakistan:Economy

Economy - overview: Pakistan is a poor, heavily populated country,
suffering from internal political disputes, lack of foreign
investment, and a costly confrontation with neighboring India.
Pakistan's economic outlook continues to be marred by its weak foreign
exchange position, notably its continued reliance on international
creditors for hard currency inflows. The MUSHARRAF government faces
$32 billion in external debt and has nearly completed rescheduling
with Paris Club members and other bilateral creditors. Foreign loans
and grants provide approximately 25% of government revenue, but debt
service obligations total nearly 50% of government expenditure. The
IMF has remained silent on future disbursements from its $1.56 billion
bailout package initiated in 1999, and other international financial
institutions are gauging the current administration's resolve to
implement necessary fiscal reforms. MUSHARRAF's ambitious economic
agenda includes measures to widen the tax net, privatize public sector
assets, and improve its balance of trade position. Pakistan has made
privatization a cornerstone of economic revival, but may have
difficulty attracting new investors until it receives positive
endorsement from the World Bank. The Bank has withheld its approval
pending resolution of the pricing dispute between the government and
independent power producers.

PANAMA

@Panama:Introduction

Background: With US backing, Panama seceded from Colombia in 1903 and
promptly signed a treaty with the US allowing for the construction of
a canal and US sovereignty over a strip of land on either side of the
structure (the Panama Canal Zone). The Panama Canal was built by the
US Army Corps of Engineers between 1904 and 1914. On 7 September 1977,
an agreement was signed for the complete transfer of the Canal from
the US to Panama by 1999. Certain portions of the Zone and increasing
responsibility over the Canal were turned over in the intervening
years. With US help, dictator Manuel NORIEGA was deposed in 1989. The
entire Panama Canal, the area supporting the Canal, and remaining US
military bases were turned over to Panama on 31 December 1999.

@Panama:Economy

Economy - overview: Because of its key geographic location, Panama's
economy is service-based, heavily weighted toward banking, commerce,
and tourism. The hand-over of the canal and military installations by
the US has given rise to new construction projects. The MOSCOSO
administration inherited an economy that is much more structurally
sound and liberalized than the one inherited by its predecessor. Even
though export demand is likely to remain slack in some key markets -
especially the Andean countries - GDP growth in 2000 probably will be
3% to 4%. Key reform initiatives from the previous administration -
including the privatization of public utilities - remain uncompleted.
Although President MOSCOSO is unlikely to overturn any previous
reforms, her populist leanings make it unlikely any new initiatives
will be undertaken in the near future. Indeed, the government has
failed to formulate a comprehensive economic policy framework, and the
only concrete step it has taken by yearend 1999 has been a hike in
agricultural tariffs.

PAPUA NEW GUINEA

@Papua New Guinea:Introduction

Background: The eastern half of the island of New Guinea - second
largest in the world - was divided between Germany (north) and the UK
(south) in 1885. The latter area was transferred to Australia in 1902,
which occupied the northern portion during World War I and continued
to administer the combined areas until independence in 1975. A
nine-year secessionist revolt on the island of Bougainville ended in
1997, after claiming some 20,000 lives.

@Afghanistan:Economy

Economy-overview: Afghanistan is an extremely poor, landlocked
country, highly dependent on farming and livestock raising (sheep and
goats). Economic considerations have played second fiddle to political
and military upheavals during more than 18 years of war, including the
nearly 10-year Soviet military occupation (which ended 15 February
1989). During the war one-third of the population fled the country,
with Pakistan and Iran sheltering a combined peak of more than 6
million refugees. Now, only 750,000 registered Afghan refugees remain
in Pakistan and about 1.2 million in Iran. Another 1 million have
probably moved into and around urban areas within Afghanistan. Gross
domestic product has fallen substantially over the past 18 years
because of the loss of labor and capital and the disruption of trade
and transport. Much of the population continues to suffer from
insufficient food, clothing, housing, and medical care. Inflation
remains a serious problem throughout the country, with one estimate
putting the rate at 240% in Kabul in 1996. Numerical data are likely
to be either unavailable or unreliable.

@Albania:Economy

Economy-overview: An extremely poor country by European standards,
Albania is making the difficult transition to a more open-market
economy. The economy rebounded in 1993-95 after a severe depression
accompanying the collapse of the previous centrally planned system in
1990 and 1991. However, a weakening of government resolve to maintain
stabilization policies in the election year of 1996 contributed to
renewal of inflationary pressures, spurred by the budget deficit which
exceeded 12%. The collapse of financial pyramid schemes in early
1997-which had attracted deposits from a substantial portion of
Albania's adult population - triggered severe social unrest which led
to more than 1,500 deaths, widespread destruction of property, and an
8% drop in GDP. The new government installed in July 1997 has taken
strong measures to restore public order and to revive economic
activity and trade. The economy continues to be bolstered by
remittances of some 20% of the labor force which works abroad, mostly
in Greece and Italy. These remittances supplement GDP and help offset
the large foreign trade deficit. Most agricultural land was privatized
in 1992, substantially improving peasant incomes.

@Algeria:Economy

Economy-overview: The hydrocarbons sector is the backbone of the
economy, accounting for roughly 57% of government revenues, 25% of
GDP, and almost all export earnings. Algeria has the fifth-largest
reserves of natural gas in the world and is the second largest gas
exporter; it ranks fourteenth for oil reserves. Algiers' efforts to
reform one of the most centrally planned economies in the Arab world
began after the 1986 collapse of world oil prices plunged the country
into a severe recession. In 1989, the government launched a
comprehensive, IMF-supported program to achieve economic stabilization
and to introduce market mechanisms into the economy. Despite
substantial progress toward economic adjustment, in 1992 the reform
drive stalled as Algiers became embroiled in political turmoil. In
September 1993, a new government was formed, and one priority was the
resumption and acceleration of the structural adjustment process.
Burdened with a heavy foreign debt, Algiers concluded a one-year
standby arrangement with the IMF in April 1994 and the following year
signed onto a three-year extended fund facility. Progress on economic
reform, a Paris Club debt rescheduling in 1995, and oil and gas sector
expansion have contributed to a recovery since 1995. Investments in
developing hydrocarbon resources are likely to maintain growth and
export earnings. Continuing but gradual government efforts to attract
foreign and domestic investment outside that sector seek to diversify
the economy and tackle problems of high unemployment and falling
living standards, problems as yet untouched by the macroeconomic
turnaround.

@American Samoa:Economy

Economy-overview: This is a traditional Polynesian economy in which
more than 90% of the land is communally owned. Economic activity is
strongly linked to the US, with which American Samoa conducts the
great bulk of its foreign trade. Tuna fishing and tuna processing
plants are the backbone of the private sector, with canned tuna the
primary export. Transfers from the US Government add substantially to
American Samoa's economic well-being. According to one observer,
attempts by the government to develop a larger and broader economy are
restrained by Samoa's remote location, its limited transportation, and
its devastating hurricanes. Tourism, a developing sector, may be held
back in 1998 by the financial difficulties in East Asia.

@Andorra:Economy

Economy-overview: Tourism, the mainstay of Andorra's tiny, well-to-do
economy, accounts for roughly 80% of GDP. An estimated 10 million
tourists visit annually, attracted by Andorra's duty-free status and
by its summer and winter resorts. Andorra's comparative advantage has
recently eroded as the economies of neighboring France and Spain have
been opened up, providing broader availability of goods and lower
tariffs. The banking sector, with its "tax haven" status, also
contributes substantially to the economy. Agricultural production is
limited by a scarcity of arable land, and most food has to be
imported. The principal livestock activity is sheep raising.
Manufacturing consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars, and furniture.
Andorra is a member of the EU Customs Union and is treated as an EU
member for trade in manufactured goods (no tariffs) and as a non-EU
member for agricultural products.

ANGOLA

Introduction

Current issues: Civil war has been the norm since independence from
Portugal on 11 November 1975. A cease-fire between the government and
(UNITA) lasted from 31 May 1991 until October 1992 when UNITA refused
to accept its defeat in internationally monitored elections and
fighting resumed throughout much of the country. The two sides signed
another peace accord on 20 November 1994 and the cease-fire is
generally holding, but military tensions and banditry persist. The
peace accord provided for the integration of former UNITA insurgents
into the Angolan armed forces and the government. A Government of
National Unity and Reconciliation was installed in April 1997 and
military integration was declared complete in June 1997, although
UNITA filled fewer than half of the military positions allocated to
the rebels. Efforts which began in May 1997 to extend government into
UNITA-occupied areas are proceeding slowly. The original 7,200-man UN
peacekeeping force began a phased drawdown in late 1996 and all UN
military components are scheduled to depart by 30 June 1998 except for
through 1998.

natural resources, output per capita is among the world's lowest.
Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for 85% of the
population. Oil production and the supporting activities are vital to
the economy, contributing about 50% to GDP. Notwithstanding the
signing of a peace accord in November 1994, sporadic violence
continues, millions of land mines remain, and many farmers are
reluctant to return to their fields. As a result, much of the
country's food must still be imported. To take advantage of its rich
resources-gold, diamonds, extensive forests, Atlantic fisheries,
arable land, and large oil deposits-Angola will need to implement the
peace agreement and reform government policies. Despite the high
inflation and political difficulties, total output grew an estimated
9% in 1996, largely due to increased oil production and higher oil
prices.

@Anguilla:Economy

Economy-overview: Anguilla has few natural resources, and the economy
depends heavily on high-class tourism, offshore banking, lobster
fishing, and remittances from emigrants. The economy, and especially
the tourism sector, suffered a setback in late 1995 due to the effects
of Hurricane Luis in September but recovered in 1996. Anguillan
officials have put substantial effort into developing the offshore
financing sector. A comprehensive package of financial services
legislation was enacted in late 1994. In the medium term, prospects
for the economy will depend on the tourism sector and, therefore, on
continuing income growth in the industrialized nations.

Government type: Antarctic Treaty Summary-The Antarctic Treaty, signed
on 1 December 1959 and entered into force on 23 June 1961, establishes
the legal framework for the management of Antarctica. Administration
is carried out through consultative member meetings-the 18th Antarctic
Treaty Consultative Meeting was in Japan in April 1993. Currently,
there are 42 treaty member nations: 26 consultative and 16 acceding.
Consultative (voting) members include the seven nations that claim
portions of Antarctica as national territory (some claims overlap) and
19 nonclaimant nations. The US and some other nations that have made
no claims have reserved the right to do so. The US does not recognize
the claims of others. The year in parentheses indicates when an
acceding nation was voted to full consultative (voting) status, while
no date indicates the country was an original 1959 treaty signatory.
Claimant nations are-Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, New Zealand,
Norway, and the UK. Nonclaimant consultative nations are-Belgium,
Brazil (1983), China (1985), Ecuador (1990), Finland (1989), Germany
(1981), India (1983), Italy (1987), Japan, South Korea (1989),
Netherlands (1990), Peru (1989), Poland (1977), South Africa, Spain
(1988), Sweden (1988), Uruguay (1985), the US, and Russia. Acceding
(nonvoting) members, with year of accession in parentheses,
are-Austria (1987), Bulgaria (1978), Canada (1988), Colombia (1988),
Cuba (1984), Czech Republic (1993), Denmark (1965), Greece (1987),
Guatemala (1991), Hungary (1984), North Korea (1987), Papua New Guinea
(1981), Romania (1971), Slovakia (1993), Switzerland (1990), and
Ukraine (1992). Article 1-area to be used for peaceful purposes only;
military activity, such as weapons testing, is prohibited, but
military personnel and equipment may be used for scientific research
or any other peaceful purpose; Article 2-freedom of scientific
investigation and cooperation shall continue; Article 3-free exchange
of information and personnel in cooperation with the UN and other
international agencies; Article 4-does not recognize, dispute, or
establish territorial claims and no new claims shall be asserted while
the treaty is in force; Article 5-prohibits nuclear explosions or
disposal of radioactive wastes; Article 6-includes under the treaty
all land and ice shelves south of 60 degrees 00 minutes south; Article
7-treaty-state observers have free access, including aerial
observation, to any area and may inspect all stations, installations,
and equipment; advance notice of all activities and of the
introduction of military personnel must be given; Article 8-allows for
jurisdiction over observers and scientists by their own states;
Article 9-frequent consultative meetings take place among member
nations; Article 10-treaty states will discourage activities by any
country in Antarctica that are contrary to the treaty; Article
11-disputes to be settled peacefully by the parties concerned or,
ultimately, by the ICJ; Articles 12, 13, 14-deal with upholding,
interpreting, and amending the treaty among involved nations; other
agreements-more than 170 recommendations adopted at treaty
consultative meetings and ratified by governments include-Agreed
Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora (1964);
Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals (1972); Convention
on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (1980); a
mineral resources agreement was signed in 1988 but was subsequently
rejected; the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic
Treaty was signed 4 October 1991 and entered into force 14 January
1998; this agreement provides for the protection of the Antarctic
environment through five specific annexes on marine pollution, fauna,
and flora, environmental impact assessments, waste management, and
protected areas; it also prohibits all activities relating to mineral
resources except scientific research; 27 parties have ratified the
Protocol as of April 1998

Legal system: US law, including certain criminal offenses by or
against US nationals, such as murder, may apply to areas not under
jurisdiction of other countries. Some US laws directly apply to
Antarctica. For example, the Antarctic Conservation Act, 16 U.S.C.
section 2401 et seq., provides civil and criminal penalties for the
following activities, unless authorized by regulation of statute: the
taking of native mammals or birds; the introduction of nonindigenous
plants and animals; entry into specially protected or scientific
areas; the discharge or disposal of pollutants; and the importation
into the US of certain items from Antarctica. Violation of the
Antarctic Conservation Act carries penalties of up to $10,000 in fines
and one year in prison. The Departments of Treasury, Commerce,
Transportation, and Interior share enforcement responsibilities.
Public Law 95-541, the US Antarctic Conservation Act of 1978, requires
expeditions from the US to Antarctica to notify, in advance, the
Office of Oceans and Polar Affairs, Room 5801, Department of State,
Washington, DC 20520, which reports such plans to other nations as
required by the Antarctic Treaty. For more information, contact Permit
Office, Office of Polar Programs, National Science Foundation,

@Antigua and Barbuda:Economy

Economy-overview: Tourism continues to be by far the dominant activity
in the economy accounting directly or indirectly to more than half of
GDP. Increased tourist arrivals have helped spur growth in the
construction and transport sectors. The dual island nation's
agricultural production is mainly directed to the domestic market; the
sector is constrained by the limited water supply and labor shortages
that reflect the pull of higher wages in tourism and construction.
Manufacturing comprises enclave-type assembly for export with major
products being bedding, handicrafts, and electronic components.
Prospects for economic growth in the medium term will continue to
depend on income growth in the industrialized world, especially in the
US, which accounts for about half of all tourist arrivals.

note: includes Baffin Bay, Barents Sea, Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea,
East Siberian Sea, Greenland Sea, Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Kara Sea,
Laptev Sea, Northwest Passage, and other tributary water bodies

Area-comparative: slightly less than 1.5 times the size of the US;
smallest of the world's four oceans (after Pacific Ocean, Atlantic
Ocean, and Indian Ocean)

Coastline: 45,389 km

Climate: polar climate characterized by persistent cold and relatively
narrow annual temperature ranges; winters characterized by continuous
darkness, cold and stable weather conditions, and clear skies; summers
characterized by continuous daylight, damp and foggy weather, and weak

@Argentina:Economy

Economy-overview: Argentina benefits from rich natural resources, a
highly literate population, an export-oriented agricultural sector,
and a diversified industrial base. Nevertheless, following decades of
mismanagement and statist policies, the economy in the late 1980s was
plagued with huge external debts and recurring bouts of
hyperinflation. Elected in 1989, in the depths of recession, President
MENEM has implemented a comprehensive economic restructuring program
that has put Argentina on a path of stable, sustainable growth.
Argentina's currency has traded at par with the US dollar since April
1991, and inflation has fallen to its lowest level in 50 years.
Argentines have responded to price stability by repatriating capital
and investing in domestic industry. Growth averaged more than 8%
between 1991 and 1994, then fell 4.6% in 1995, largely in reaction to
the Mexican peso crisis. The economy has since recovered strongly.
However, unemployment remains nearly 14%, and Buenos Aires still
depends on foreign capital to meet the bulk of its financing needs.
The IMF has urged additional economic reforms to ensure equitable
long-term growth.

ARMENIA

Introduction

Current issues: Armenia's leaders remain preoccupied by Armenia's
10-year conflict with Azerbaijan over the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave.
Although a cease-fire has been in effect since May 1994, the sides
have not made substantial progress toward a peaceful resolution. In
January 1998, differences between President TER-PETROSSIAN and members
of his cabinet over the Nagorno-Karabakh peace process came to a head.
With the prime minister and defense and security ministers arrayed
against him, an isolated TER-PETROSSIAN resigned the presidency on 3
February 1998. Robert KOCHARIAN, TER-PETROSSIAN's prime minister, was
elected president in March 1998. Concerns about Armenia's economic
performance rose in 1997 with a slowdown in growth and an increase in
inflation.

@Armenia:Economy

Economy-overview: Under the old Soviet central planning system,
Armenia had developed a modern industrial sector, supplying machine
tools, textiles, and other manufactured goods to sister republics in
exchange for raw materials and energy. Since the implosion of the USSR
in December 1991, Armenia has switched to small-scale agriculture away
from the large agroindustrial complexes of the Soviet area. The
agricultural sector has long-term needs for more investment and
updated technology. The privatization of industry has been at a slower
pace, but ahead of most of the rest of the CIS. Armenia is a food
importer and its mineral deposits (gold, bauxite) are small. The
ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan over the ethnic Armenian-dominated
region of Nagorno-Karabakh and the embargoes imposed by Azerbaijan and
Turkey contributed to a severe economic decline in the early 1990s. By
1994, however, the Armenian Government had launched an ambitious
IMF-sponsored economic program that has resulted in positive growth
rates in 1995-97. Armenia also managed to slash inflation and to
privatize most small and medium-sized enterprises. The chronic energy
shortages Armenia suffered in recent years has been partially offset
by the energy supplied by one of its nuclear power plants at Metsamor,
which in 1996 supplied about 40% of the country's energy needs,
according to the Armenian Government. Moreover, Armenia is expanding
its energy imports from Iran.

@Aruba:Economy

Economy-overview: Tourism is the mainstay of the Aruban economy,
although offshore banking and oil refining and storage are also
important. The rapid growth of the tourism sector over the last decade
has resulted in a substantial expansion of other activities.
Construction has boomed, with hotel capacity five times the 1985
level. In addition, the reopening of the country's oil refinery in
1993, a major source of employment and foreign exchange earnings, has
further spurred growth. Aruba's small labor force and less than 1%
unemployment rate have led to a large number of unfilled job vacancies
despite sharp rises in wage rates in recent years.

@Australia:Economy

Economy-overview: Australia has a prosperous Western-style capitalist
economy, with a per capita GDP at the level of the highly
industrialized West European countries. Rich in natural resources,
Australia is a major exporter of agricultural products, minerals,
metals, and fossil fuels. Commodities account for 57% of the value of
total exports, so that a downturn in world commodity prices can have a
big impact on the economy. The government is pushing for increased
exports of manufactured goods, but competition in international
markets continues to be severe. Australia has suffered from the low
growth and high unemployment characterizing the OECD countries in the
early 1990s, but the economy has expanded at reasonably steady rates
in recent years. In addition to high unemployment, short-term economic
problems include a balancing of output growth and inflationary
pressures and the stimulation of exports to offset rising imports,
especially given the economic crisis in Asia.

@Austria:Economy

Economy-overview: Austria, a member of the European Union since 1
January 1995, has a well-developed market economy with a high standard
of living. With exports of goods and services reaching over 40% of
GDP, Austria's economy is closely integrated with other EU member
countries, especially with Germany. Austria's entry into the EU has
drawn an influx of foreign investors attracted by Austria's access to
the single European market. Austria is well on its way to meeting all
Maastricht convergence criteria for monetary union, through
privatization efforts, the 1996-98 budget consolidation programs, and
austerity measures, which were expected to bring total public sector
deficit down to 3% of GDP in 1997 and public debt in line with the 60%
of GDP required by the EU. Cuts mainly affect the civil service and
Austria's generous social system, the two major causes of the
government deficit. To meet increased competition from both the EU and
Central European countries, Austria will need to emphasize
knowledge-based sectors of the economy and deregulate the service
sector, particularly telecommunications and the energy sector.
Economic prospects are expected to brighten in 1998 with GDP growth
projected to be 2.5%.

AZERBAIJAN

Introduction

Current issues: Azerbaijan continues to be plagued by an unresolved
10-year-old conflict with Armenian separatists over its
Nagorno-Karabakh region. The Karabakh Armenians have declared
independence and seized almost 20% of the country's territory,
creating almost 1 million Azerbaijani refugees in the process. Both
sides have generally observed a Russian-mediated cease-fire in place
since May 1994.

@Azerbaijan:Geography

Location: Southwestern Asia, bordering the Caspian Sea, between Iran
and Russia

Environment-current issues: local scientists consider the Abseron
(Apsheron) Peninsula (including Baku and Sumqayit) and the Caspian Sea
to be the ecologically most devastated area in the world because of
severe air, water, and soil pollution; soil pollution results from the
use of DDT as a pesticide and also from toxic defoliants used in the
production of cotton

@Azerbaijan:Economy

Economy-overview: Azerbaijan is less developed industrially than
either Armenia or Georgia, the other Transcaucasian states. It
resembles the Central Asian states in its majority nominally Muslim
population, high structural unemployment, and low standard of living.
The economy's most prominent products are oil, cotton, and gas.
Production from the Caspian oil and gas field has been in decline for
several years, but the negotiation of more than a dozen
production-sharing arrangements (PSAs) with foreign firms, which have
thus far committed $30 billion to oil field development, should
generate the funds needed to spur future industrial development. Oil
production under the first of these PSAs, with the Azerbaijan
International Operating Company, began in November 1997. Azerbaijan
shares all the formidable problems of the ex-Soviet republics in
making the transition from a command to a market economy, but its
considerable energy resources brighten its long-term prospects. Baku
has only recently begun making progress on economic reform, and old
economic ties and structures are slowly being replaced. A major
short-term obstacle to economic progress, including stepped up foreign
investment, is the continuing conflict with Armenia over the ethnic
Armenian-dominated region of Nagorno-Karabakh. Trade with Russia and
the other former Soviet republics is declining in importance while
trade is building up with the nations of Europe, Turkey, Iran, and the
UAE. A serious long-term challenge is the maintenance of the
competitiveness of non-oil exports in world markets.

@Bahamas, The:Economy

Economy-overview: The Bahamas is a stable, developing nation with an
economy heavily dependent on tourism and offshore banking. Tourism
alone accounts for more than 50% of GDP and directly or indirectly
employs 40% of the archipelago's labor force. Moderate growth in
tourism receipts and a boom in construction of new hotels, resorts,
and residences led to an increase of the country's GDP by an estimated
3.5% in 1997. Manufacturing and agriculture together contribute less
than 10% of GDP and show little growth despite government incentives
aimed at those sectors. Overall growth prospects in the short run will
depend heavily on the fortunes of the tourism sector and continued
income growth in the US, which accounts for the majority of tourist
visitors.

@Bahrain:Economy

Economy-overview: In Bahrain, petroleum production and processing
account for about 60% of export receipts, 60% of government revenues,
and 30% of GDP. Economic conditions have fluctuated with the changing
fortunes of oil since 1985, for example, during and following the Gulf
crisis of 1990-91. With its highly developed communication and
transport facilities, Bahrain is home to numerous multinational firms
with business in the Gulf. A large share of exports consists of
petroleum products made from imported crude. Construction proceeds on
several major industrial projects. Unemployment, especially among the
young, and the depletion of both oil and underground water resources
are major long-term economic problems.

@Bangladesh:Economy

Economy-overview: Despite sustained domestic and international efforts
to improve economic and demographic prospects, Bangladesh remains one
of the world's poorest, most densely populated, and least developed
nations. Annual GDP growth has averaged over 4% in recent years from a
low base. Its economy is largely agricultural, with the cultivation of
rice the single most important activity in the economy. Major
impediments to growth include frequent cyclones and floods, the
inefficiency of state-owned enterprises, a rapidly growing labor force
that cannot be absorbed by agriculture, delays in exploiting energy
resources (natural gas), inadequate power supplies, and slow
implementation of economic reforms. Frequent strikes that crippled the
economy in 1995 and early 1996 subsided after Prime Minister Sheikh
HASINA Wajed's Awami League government assumed power in mid-1996,
allowing a return to normal economic activity. The current government
has made some headway improving the climate for foreign investors and
liberalizing the capital markets; for example, it has negotiated with
foreign firms for oil and gas exploration, better countrywide
distribution of cooking gas, and the construction of natural gas
pipelines and power plants. Progress on other economic reforms has
been halting because of opposition from the bureaucracy, public sector
unions, and other vested interest groups.

@Barbados:Economy

dependent on sugarcane cultivation and related activities, but
production in recent years has diversified into manufacturing and
tourism. The start of the Port Charles Marina project in Speightstown
helped the tourism industry continue to expand in 1996-97. The
government continues its efforts to reduce the unacceptably high
unemployment rate, encourage direct foreign investment, and privatize
remaining state-owned enterprises.

@Belarus:Economy

Economy-overview: The Belarusian government has revived economic
output since mid-1996 by pursuing a policy of rapid credit expansion,
ending years of cumulative decline. Real GDP increased by 2.6% in 1996
and the growth rate tripled in 1997. Lack of profitability and
resurgent inflation-which increased from an average monthly rate of
2.8% in 1996 to 4.4% in 1997-however, have kept enterprises from
making much needed capital investments. As a result, infrastructure
and equipment stocks have continued to deteriorate. Belarus has seen
little structural reform since 1995, when LUKASHENKO launched the
country on the path of "market socialism." Privatization of
enterprises controlled by the central government virtually ceased in
1996. As of May 1997, only about 10% of all enterprises under central
government control had been privatized. In addition, LUKASHENKO has
re-imposed administrative control over prices and the national
currency's exchange rate, and expanded the state's right to intervene
arbitrarily in the management of private enterprise. Lack of
structural reform, and a climate hostile to business, have inhibited
foreign investment in Belarus in 1995-97. In 1995 Belarus ranked
second to last among the 15 former Soviet republics in terms of the
average amount of foreign investment it attracted per capita. Although
it moved up to 11th place in 1996, this was largely due to inflows
from Russia related to the construction of the Yamal natural gas
pipeline. Belarus's trade deficit has grown steadily over the past
three years - from 8% of total trade turnover in 1995 to 14% in the
first quarter of 1997 - despite the government's efforts to promote
exports and limit imports. Given Belarus's limited fiscal reserve, a
continued growth in the trade deficit will increase vulnerability to a
balance of payments crisis.

@Belgium:Economy

Economy-overview: This highly developed private enterprise economy has
capitalized on its central geographic location, highly developed
transport network, and diversified industrial and commercial base.
Industry is concentrated mainly in the populous Flemish area in the
north, although the government is encouraging reinvestment in the
southern region of Walloon. With few natural resources, Belgium must
import substantial quantities of raw materials and export a large
volume of manufactures, making its economy unusually dependent on the
state of world markets. Two-thirds of its trade is with other EU
countries. The economy grew at a strong 4% annual pace during the
period 1988-90, slowed to 1% in 1991-92, dropped by 1.5% in 1993,
recovered with moderate 2.3% growth in 1994 and 1995, and fell off
again to 1.4% in 1996, with continued substantial unemployment.
Belgium's public debt fell from 127% of GDP in 1996 to 124% in 1997,
and the government is trying to control its expenditures to bring the
figure more into line with other industrialized countries. GDP growth
of 2.5% is forecast for 1998.

@Belize:Economy

Economy-overview: The small, essentially private enterprise economy is
based primarily on agriculture, agro-based industry, and
merchandising, with tourism and construction assuming greater
importance. Sugar, the chief crop, accounts for more than one-third of
exports, while the banana industry is the country's largest employer.
The government's tough austerity program in 1997 resulted in an
economic slowdown that is likely to continue in 1998. Political
tension in the run-up to the elections will tend to discourage
investment, already suffering as a result of tight monetary and fiscal
policies. The trade deficit has been growing, mostly as a result of
low export prices for sugar and bananas and could increase further if
a pre-election boost in government spending leads to a rise in
imports. The ruling in 1997 by the World Trade Organization against
the European Union's banana import regime-which had granted Belize
preferential treatment - is also hurting the prospects for growth, and
could contribute to an increase in already high unemployment.

@Benin:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy of Benin remains underdeveloped and
dependent on subsistence agriculture, cotton production, and regional
trade. Growth in real output, which had averaged a sound 4% during
1990-95, rose to 5.5% in 1996 and was targeted at 4.8% for 1997. Rapid
population growth offset much of this growth in output. Inflation
jumped to 55% in 1994 (compared to 3% in 1993) following the 50%
currency devaluation in January 1994, but has subsided over the past
three years, with a target of 3.5% inflation in 1997. Commercial and
transport activities, which make up a large part of GDP, are extremely
vulnerable to developments in Nigeria, particularly fuel shortages.
Support by the Paris Club and official bilateral creditors has eased
the external debt situation in recent years. The government, still
burdened with money-losing state enterprises and a bloated civil
service, has been gradually implementing a World Bank supported
structural adjustment program since 1991.

@Bermuda:Economy

Economy-overview: Bermuda enjoys one of the highest per capita incomes
in the world, having successfully exploited its location by providing
financial services for international firms and luxury tourist
facilities for 360,000 visitors annually. The tourist industry, which
accounts for an estimated 28% of GDP, attracts 84% of its business
from North America. The industrial sector is small, and agriculture is
severely limited by a lack of suitable land. About 80% of food needs
are imported. International business contributes over 60% of Bermuda's
economic output; a failed independence vote in late 1995 can be
partially attributed to Bermudian fears of scaring away foreign firms.

@Bhutan:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy, one of the world's smallest and least
developed, is based on agriculture and forestry, which provide the
main livelihood for 90% of the population and account for about 40% of
GDP. Agriculture consists largely of subsistence farming and animal
husbandry. Rugged mountains dominate the terrain and make the building
of roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive. The economy
is closely aligned with India's through strong trade and monetary
links. The industrial sector is technologically backward, with most
production of the cottage industry type. Most development projects,
such as road construction, rely on Indian migrant labor. Bhutan's
hydropower potential and its attraction for tourists are key
resources. The Bhutanese Government has made some progress in
expanding the nation's productive base and improving social welfare.
Model education, social, and environment programs in Bhutan are
underway with support from multilateral development organizations.
Each economic program takes into account the government's desire to
protect the country's environment and cultural traditions. GDP growth
averaged 5% per year in 1991-95, with information not yet available
for 1996-97. Detailed controls and uncertain policies in areas like
industrial licensing, trade, labor, and finance continue to hamper
foreign investment.

@Bolivia:Economy

Economy-overview: With its long history of semifeudal social controls,
dependence on volatile prices for its mineral exports, and bouts of
hyperinflation, Bolivia has remained one of the poorest and least
developed Latin American countries. However, Bolivia has experienced
generally improving economic conditions since the PAZ Estenssoro
administration (1985-89) introduced market-oriented policies which
reduced inflation from 11,700% in 1985 to about 20% in 1988. PAZ
Estenssoro was followed as president by Jaime PAZ Zamora (1989-93) who
continued the free-market policies of his predecessor, despite
opposition from his own party and from Bolivia's once powerful labor
movement. By maintaining fiscal discipline, PAZ Zamora helped reduce
inflation to 9.3% in 1993, while GDP grew by an annual average of
3.25% during his tenure. President SANCHEZ DE LOZADA (1993-1997) vowed
to advance the market-oriented economic reforms he helped launch as
PAZ Estenssoro's planning minister. His successes included the signing
of a free trade agreement with Mexico and the Southern Cone Common
Market (Mercosur) as well as the privatization of the state airline,
phone company, railroad, electric power company, and oil company.
Furthermore, SANCHEZ DE LOZADA sponsored legislation creating private
social security accounts for all adult Bolivians and capitalized these
new accounts with the state's remaining 50% share in the privatized
companies. Hugo BANZER Suarez took office in August 1997 and has
proclaimed his commitment to the economic reforms of the previous
administration.

BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA

Introduction

Current issues: On 21 November 1995, in Dayton, Ohio, the former
Yugoslavia's three warring parties signed a peace agreement that
brought to a halt over three years of interethnic civil strife in
Bosnia and Herzegovina (the final agreement was signed in Paris on 14
December 1995). The Dayton Agreement, signed then by Bosnian President
IZETBEGOVIC, Croatian President TUDJMAN, and Serbian President
MILOSEVIC, divides Bosnia and Herzegovina roughly equally between the
Muslim/Croat Federation and the Bosnian Serbs while maintaining
Bosnia's currently recognized borders. In 1995-96, a NATO-led
international peacekeeping force (IFOR) of 60,000 troops served in
Bosnia to implement and monitor the military aspects of the agreement.
IFOR was succeeded by a smaller, NATO-led Stabilization Force (SFOR)
whose mission is to deter renewed hostilities. SFOR will remain in
place until June 1998. A High Representative appointed by the UN
Security Council is responsible for civilian implementation of the
accord, including monitoring implementation, facilitating any
difficulties arising in connection with civilian implementation, and
coordinating activities of the civilian organizations and agencies in
Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Bosnian conflict began in the spring of
1992 when the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina held a referendum
on independence and the Bosnian Serbs - supported by neighboring
Serbia-responded with armed resistance aimed at partitioning the
republic along ethnic lines and joining Serb-held areas to form a
"greater Serbia." In March 1994, Bosnia's Muslims and Croats reduced
the number of warring factions from three to two by signing an
agreement in Washington creating their joint Muslim/Croat Federation
of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Federation, formed by the Muslims and
Croats in March 1994, is one of two entities (the other being the
Bosnian Serb-led Republika Srpska) that comprise Bosnia and
Herzegovina.

Government-note: Until declaring independence in spring 1992, Bosnia
and Herzegovina existed as a republic in the former Yugoslavia. Bosnia
was partitioned by fighting during 1992-95 and governed by competing
ethnic factions. Bosnia's current governing structures were created by
the Dayton Accords, the 1995 peace agreement which was officially
signed in Paris on 14 December 1995 by Bosnian President IZETBEGOVIC,
Croatian President TUDJMAN, and Serbian President MILOSEVIC. This
agreement retained Bosnia's exterior border and created a joint
multi-ethnic and democratic government. This national government-based
on proportional representation similar to that which existed in the
former socialist regime-is charged with conducting foreign, economic,
and fiscal policy. The Dayton Accords also recognized a second tier of
government, comprised of two entities-a joint Muslim/Croat Federation
and the Bosnian Serb Republika Srpska (RS)-each presiding over roughly
one-half the territory. The Federation and RS governments are charged
with overseeing internal functions. As mandated by the Dayton Accords,
the Bosnians on 14 September 1996 participated in the first post-war
elections of national, entity, and cantonal leaders. The Bosnians have
been slow to form and install new joint institutions. A new Federation
cabinet was sworn in 18 December 1996 and the new Bosnian central
government cabinet was confirmed on 3 January 1997. The Bosnians on
13-14 September 1997 participated in municipal elections, postponed in
1996 because of voter registration irregularities.

@Bosnia and Herzegovina:Economy

Economy-overview: Bosnia and Herzegovina ranked next to The Former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as the poorest republic in the old
Yugoslav federation. Although agriculture has been almost all in
private hands, farms have been small and inefficient, and the republic
traditionally has been a net importer of food. Industry has been
greatly overstaffed, one reflection of the rigidities of communist
central planning and management. TITO had pushed the development of
military industries in the republic with the result that Bosnia hosted
a large share of Yugoslavia's defense plants. The bitter interethnic
warfare in Bosnia caused production to plummet by 80% from 1990 to
1995, unemployment to soar, and human misery to multiply. With an
uneasy peace in place, output has recovered in 1996-97 at high
percentage rates on a low base, but remains less than half the 1990
level. The country, especially in the Muslim-Croat area, receives
substantial amounts of humanitarian aid from the international
community. Wide regional differences in war damage and access to the
outside world have resulted in substantial variations in living
conditions among local areas and individual families.

@Botswana:Economy

Economy-overview: Agriculture still provides a livelihood for more
than 80% of the population but supplies only about 50% of food needs
and accounts for only 4% of GDP. Subsistence farming and cattle
raising predominate. Diamond mining and tourism also are important to
the economy. The sector is plagued by erratic rainfall and poor soils.
Substantial mineral deposits were found in the 1970s and the mining
sector grew from 25% of GDP in 1980 to 35% in 1997. Unemployment
officially is 21% but unofficial estimates place it closer to 40%. On
the plus side is the substantial positive trade balance.

@Brazil:Economy

Economy-overview: Possessing large and well-developed agricultural,
mining, manufacturing, and service sectors, Brazil's economy outweighs
that of all other South American countries and is expanding its
presence in world markets. Prior to the institution of a stabilization
plan-the Plano Real (Real Plan) in mid-1994, stratospheric inflation
rates had disrupted economic activity and discouraged foreign
investment. Since then, tight monetary policy has brought inflation
under control-consumer prices increased by less than 5% in 1997
compared to more than 1,000% in 1994. At the same time, GDP growth
slowed from 5.7% in 1994 to about 3.0% in 1997 due to tighter credit.
The strong currency, another cornerstone of the Real Plan, has
encouraged imports-contributing to a growing trade deficit-and
restrained export growth. Brazil's more stable economy allowed it to
weather the fallout in 1995 from the Mexican peso crisis relatively
well. Record levels of foreign investment have flowed in, helping
support the Real Plan through financial shocks in October-November
1997 that occurred in the wake of the Asian financial crisis. These
shocks caused Brazil's foreign exchange reserves to drop by $8 billion
to $52 billion and the stock market to decline by about 25%, although
it still ended up more than 30% for the year. President CARDOSO
remains committed to defending the Real Plan, but he faces several key
challenges domestically and abroad. His package of fiscal reforms
requiring constitutional amendments has progressed slowly through the
balkanized Brazilian legislature; in their absence, the government
continues to run deficits and has limited room to relax its interest
and exchange rate policies if it wants to keep inflation under
control. Some foreign investors remain concerned about the viability
of Brazil's exchange rate policy because of the country's fiscal and
current account deficits. The government thus has to contend with the
possibility of capital flight or a speculative attack that could draw
down foreign reserves to a critical level and force a devaluation.

@British Virgin Islands:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy, one of the most prosperous in the
Caribbean, is highly dependent on tourism, which generates an
estimated 45% of the national income. In 1985, the government began
offering offshore registration to companies wishing to incorporate in
the islands, and incorporation fees now generate substantial revenues.
An estimated 210,000 companies were on the offshore registry by
yearend 1996. The adoption of a comprehensive insurance law in late
1994, which provides a blanket of confidentiality with regulated
statutory gateways for investigation of criminal offenses, is expected
to make the British Virgin Islands even more attractive to
international business. Livestock raising is the most important
agricultural activity; poor soils limit the islands' ability to meet
domestic food requirements. Because of traditional close links with
the US Virgin Islands, the British Virgin Islands has used the dollar
as their currency since 1959.

@Brunei:Economy

Economy-overview: This small, wealthy economy is a mixture of foreign
and domestic entrepreneurship, government regulation and welfare
measures, and village tradition. It is almost totally supported by
exports of crude oil and natural gas, with revenues from the petroleum
sector accounting for perhaps half of GDP. Per capita GDP is far above
most other Third World countries, and substantial income from overseas
investment supplements income from domestic production. The government
provides for all medical services and subsidizes food and housing. The
government is beginning to show progress on its basic policy of
diversifying the economy away from oil and gas. Brunei's leaders are
concerned that steadily increased integration in the world economy
will undermine internal social cohesion.

@Bulgaria:Economy

Economy-overview: One of the poorest countries of central Europe,
Bulgaria has slowly been moving from its old command economy towards a
market-oriented economy. The economy faced a major crisis in 1996,
marked by a banking system in turmoil, a depreciating currency, and
contracting production and foreign trade. Foreign exchange reserves
dwindled to $518 million, while dramatically hiked interest rates
added to the domestic debt burden and stifled growth. GDP fell by 11%
in 1996, after experiencing 2.0% growth in 1995. Privatization of
state-owned industries stagnated, although the first auction of a mass
privatization program was undertaken in late 1996. Lagging progress on
structural reforms led to postponement of IMF disbursements under a
$580 million standby loan agreed to in July 1996. In November 1996,
the IMF proposed a currency board as Bulgaria's best chance to restore
confidence in the lev, eliminate unnecessary spending, and avoid
hyperinflation. The board was set up on 1 July 1997. Its establishment
was followed by a reduction in inflation and interest rates and by a
rise in foreign investment. Simultaneously the government pledged to
sell off some of the most attractive state assets. GDP in 1997 dropped
7.4%, but is expected to rebound to an estimated 2% in 1998. Other
government objectives include: the completion of land reform, the
privatization and strengthening of the banking system, and the
modernization of the legal environment of business.

@Burma:Economy

Economy-overview: Burma has a mixed economy with private activity
dominant in agriculture, light industry, and transport, and with
substantial state-controlled activity, mainly in energy, heavy
industry, and the rice trade. Government policy in the last nine
years, 1989-97, has aimed at revitalizing the economy after three
decades of tight central planning. Thus, private activity has markedly
increased; foreign investment has been encouraged, so far with
moderate success; and efforts continue to increase the efficiency of
state enterprises. Published estimates of Burma's foreign trade are
greatly understated because of the volume of black-market trade. A
major ongoing problem is the failure to achieve monetary and fiscal
stability. Although Burma remains a poor Asian country, its rich
resources furnish the potential for substantial long-term increases in
income, exports, and living standards.

BURUNDI

Introduction

Current issues: in a number of waves since October 1993, hundreds of
thousands of refugees have fled the ethnic violence between the Hutu
and Tutsi factions in Burundi and crossed into Rwanda, Tanzania, and
Zaire (now called Democratic Republic of the Congo); since October
1996, an estimated 92,000 Hutu refuguees have been forced to return to
Burundi by Tutsi rebel forces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
leaving an estimated 35,000 still dispersed there; in Burundi, the
ethnic violence between the Hutus and the Tutsis continued in 1996,
causing an additional 150,000 Hutus to flee to Tanzania, thus raising
their numbers in that country to about 250,000

@Burundi:Economy

Economy-overview: Burundi is a landlocked, resource-poor country in an
early stage of economic development. The economy is predominately
agricultural with roughly 90% of the population dependent on
subsistence agriculture. Its economic health depends on the coffee
crop, which accounts for 80% of foreign exchange earnings. The ability
to pay for imports therefore rests largely on the vagaries of the
climate and the international coffee market. As part of its economic
reform agenda, launched in February 1991 with IMF and World Bank
support, Burundi is trying to diversify its agricultural exports,
attract foreign investment in industry, and modernize government
budgetary practices. Since October 1993 the nation has suffered from
massive ethnic-based violence which has resulted in the death of
perhaps 100,000 persons and the displacement of a million others.
Foods, medicines, and electricity remain in short supply. An
impoverished and disorganized government can hardly implement the
needed reform programs.

@Cambodia:Economy

Economy-overview: After four years of solid macroeconomic performance,
Cambodia's economy slowed dramatically in 1997 due to the twin shocks
of the regional economic crisis and the July violence and political
infighting. Economic growth fell from 6.5% in 1996 to 1.5% in 1997,
foreign investment slowed, and tourism declined 16% from 1996 levels.
Despite these difficulties, inflation accelerated only slightly to
9.5%; the government managed to keep the national budget in balance
even with increased expenditures on the military and police; and the
economy ran a small balance of payments surplus. The future payments
could be adversely affected by the currency crises in Thailand,
Malaysia, and Indonesia, which tends to make Cambodia's exports more
expensive at the same time imports from these countries become
cheaper. The long-term development of the economy after decades of war
remains a daunting challenge. Human resource levels in the population
are low, particularly in the poverty-ridden countryside. The almost
total lack of basic infrastructure in the countryside will continue to
hinder development. Recurring political instability hinders foreign
investment. Corruption and inexperience among Cambodia's government
officials will serve as a further drag on the economy.

@Cameroon:Economy

Economy-overview: Because of its oil resources and favorable
agricultural conditions, Cameroon has one of the best-endowed primary
commodity economies in sub-Saharan Africa. Still, it faces many of the
serious problems facing other underdeveloped countries, such as a
top-heavy civil service and a generally unfavorable climate for
business enterprise. The development of the oil sector led to rapid
economic growth between 1970 and 1985. Growth came to an abrupt halt
in 1986, precipitated by steep declines in the prices of major
exports: petroleum, coffee, and cocoa. Export earnings were cut by
almost one-third, and inefficiencies in fiscal management were
exposed. Since 1990, the government has embarked on various IMF and
World Bank programs designed to spur business investment, increase
efficiency in agriculture, improve trade, and recapitalize the
nation's banks. The government, however, failed to press forward
vigorously with these programs. The latest enhanced structural
adjustment agreement was signed in October 1997; the parties hope this
will prove more successful, yet government mismanagement remains a
problem. Inflation, which rose to 48% after the devaluation of 1994,
has been brought back under control. Progress toward privatization of
remaining state industry remains slow. President BIYA's new government
of December 1997 has replaced old hands in the government economic
control structure with promising technocrats.

@Canada:Economy

Economy-overview: As an affluent, high-tech industrial society, Canada
today closely resembles the US in its market-oriented economic system,
pattern of production, and high living standards. Since World War II,
the impressive growth of the manufacturing, mining, and service
sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural economy into
one primarily industrial and urban. Canada started the 1990s in
recession, and real rates of growth have averaged only 1.1% so far
this decade. Because of slower growth, Canada still faces high
unemployment-especially in Quebec and the Maritime Provinces-and a
large public sector debt. With its great natural resources, skilled
labor force, and modern capital plant, however, Canada will enjoy
better economic prospects in the future. The continuing constitutional
impasse between English- and French-speaking areas is raising the
possibility of a split in the federation, making foreign investors
somewhat edgy.

@Cape Verde:Economy

Economy-overview: Cape Verde's low per capita GDP reflects a poor
natural resource base, serious water shortages exacerbated by cycles
of long-term drought, and a high birth rate. The economy is
service-oriented, with commerce, transport, and public services
accounting for almost 70% of GDP. Although nearly 70% of the
population lives in rural areas, the share of agriculture in GDP in
1995 was only 8%, of which fishing accounts for 1.5%. About 90% of
food must be imported. The fishing potential, mostly lobster and tuna,
is not fully exploited. Cape Verde annually runs a high trade deficit,
financed by foreign aid and remittances from emigrants; remittances
constitute a supplement to GDP of more than 20%. Economic reforms,
launched by the new democratic government in 1991, are aimed at
developing the private sector and attracting foreign investment to
diversify the economy. Prospects for 1998 depend heavily on the
maintenance of aid flows, remittances, and the momentum of the
government's development program.

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC

Introduction

Current issues: In 1996, the Central African Republic experienced
three mutinies by dissident elements of the armed forces, which
demanded back pay as well as political and military reforms.
Continuing violence in 1997 between the government and rebel military
groups over pay issues, living conditions, and lack of opposition
party representation in the government has destroyed many businesses
in the capital, reducing tax revenues and exacerbating the
government's problems in meeting expenses.

@Central African Republic:Economy

Economy-overview: Subsistence agriculture, together with forestry,
remains the backbone of the economy of the Central African Republic
(CAR), with more than 70% of the population living in outlying areas.
The agricultural sector generates half of GDP. Timber has accounted
for about 16% of export earnings and the diamond industry for nearly
54%. Important constraints to economic development include the CAR's
landlocked position, a poor transportation system, a largely unskilled
work force, and a legacy of misdirected macroeconomic policies. The
50% devaluation of the currencies of 14 Francophone African nations on
12 January 1994 had mixed effects on the CAR's economy. Diamond,
timber, coffee, and cotton exports increased, leading an estimated
rise of GDP of 7% in 1994 and nearly 5% in 1995. Military rebellions
and social unrest in 1996 were accompanied by widespread destruction
of property and a drop in GDP of 1%. Ongoing violence between the
government and rebel military groups over pay issues, living
conditions, and political representation has destroyed many businesses
in the capital, reduced tax revenues for the government, and delayed
negotiations for an IMF financial aid agreement.

CHAD

Introduction

Historical perspective: In December 1990, after Chad had endured
decades of civil warfare among ethnic groups as well as invasions by
Libya, former northern guerrilla leader Idriss DEBY seized control of
the government. His transitional government eventually suppressed or
came to terms with most political-military groups, settled the
territorial dispute with Libya on terms favorable to Chad, drafted a
democratic constitution which was ratified by popular referendum in
March 1996, held multiparty national presidential elections in June
and July 1996 (DEBY won with 67% of the vote), and held multiparty
elections for the National Assembly in January and February 1997, in
which Idriss DEBY's party, Patriotic Salvation Movement or MPS, won a
majority of the seats.

@Chad:Economy

Economy-overview: Landlocked Chad's economic development suffers from
it's geographic remoteness, drought, lack of infrastructure, and
political turmoil. About 85% of the population depends on agriculture,
including the herding of livestock. Of Africa's Francophone countries,
Chad benefited least from the 50% devaluation of their currencies in
January 1994. Financial aid from the World Bank, the African
Development Fund, and other sources is directed largely at the
improvement of agriculture, especially livestock production. Lack of
financing, however, is stalling the development of a southern oil
field and the construction of a proposed oil pipeline through
Cameroon.

@Chile:Economy

Economy-overview: Chile has a prosperous, essentially free market
economy. Civilian governments - which took over from the military in
March 1990-have continued to reduce the government's role in the
economy while shifting the emphasis of public spending toward social
programs. Growth in real GDP averaged more than 7.0% in 1991-1997, and
inflation is nearing a 40-year low. Chile's currency and foreign
reserves also are strong, as sustained foreign capital
inflows-including significant direct investment-have more than offset
current account deficits and public debt buybacks. President FREI, who
took office in March 1994, has placed improving Chile's education
system and developing foreign export markets at the top of his
economic agenda. Despite this progress, the Chilean economy remains
largely dependent on a few sectors-particularly copper mining,
fishing, and forestry. Success in meeting the government's goal of
sustained annual economic growth of 5% depends largely on world prices
for these commodities, continued foreign investor confidence, and the
government's ability to maintain a conservative fiscal stance. In
1996, Chile became an associate member of Mercosur and concluded a
Free Trade Agreement with Canada.

@China:Economy

Economy-overview: Beginning in late 1978 the Chinese leadership has
been trying to move the economy from a sluggish Soviet-style centrally
planned economy to a more market-oriented economy but still within a
rigid political framework of Communist Party control. To this end the
authorities switched to a system of household responsibility in
agriculture in place of the old collectivization, increased the
authority of local officials and plant managers in industry, permitted
a wide variety of small-scale enterprise in services and light
manufacturing, and opened the economy to increased foreign trade and
investment. The result has been a quadrupling of GDP since 1978.
Agricultural output doubled in the 1980s, and industry also posted
major gains, especially in coastal areas near Hong Kong and opposite
Taiwan, where foreign investment helped spur output of both domestic
and export goods. On the darker side, the leadership has often
experienced in its hybrid system the worst results of socialism
(bureaucracy, lassitude, corruption) and of capitalism (windfall gains
and stepped-up inflation). Beijing thus has periodically backtracked,
retightening central controls at intervals. In 1992-97 annual growth
of GDP accelerated, particularly in the coastal areas-averaging about
10% annually according to official figures. In late 1993 China's
leadership approved additional long-term reforms aimed at giving still
more play to market-oriented institutions and at strengthening the
center's control over the financial system; state enterprises would
continue to dominate many key industries in what was now termed "a
socialist market economy." In 1995-97 inflation dropped sharply,
reflecting tighter monetary policies and stronger measures to control
food prices. At the same time, the government struggled to (a) collect
revenues due from provinces, businesses, and individuals; (b) reduce
corruption and other economic crimes; and (c) keep afloat the large
state-owned enterprises, most of which had not participated in the
vigorous expansion of the economy and many of which have been losing
the ability to pay full wages and pensions. From 60 to 100 million
surplus rural workers are adrift between the villages and the cities,
many subsisting through part-time low-paying jobs. Popular resistance,
changes in central policy, and loss of authority by rural cadres have
weakened China's population control program, which is essential to
maintaining growth in living standards. Another long-term threat to
continued rapid economic growth is the deterioration in the
environment, notably air pollution, soil erosion, and the steady fall
of the water table especially in the north. China continues to lose
arable land because of erosion and economic development; furthermore,
the regime gives insufficient priority to agricultural research. The
next few years may witness increasing tensions between a highly
centralized political system and an increasingly decentralized
economic system. Rapid economic growth likely will continue but at a
declining rate. Hong Kong's reversion on 1 July 1997 to Chinese
administration will strengthen the already close ties between the two
economies.

@Colombia:Economy

Economy-overview: Columbia is recovering from a short recession that
began in late 1996 - resulting from tight monetary policy to drive
down inflation, declining business confidence related to President
SAMPER's political difficulties, and a slowdown in exports stemming
from an appreciation of the peso and a recession in neighboring
Venezuela. Although 1997's 3.1% GDP growth rate represented an
improvement over 1996, it ranked among the lowest in Latin America and
was substantially lower than the average annual growth rate exceeding
4% that Colombia posted for several decades prior to SAMPER's
election. Colombia's next president will inherit a variety of economic
problems. Most notably, the unemployment rate is at its highest level
this decade, risks for the export sector and foreign investors are
rising as a result of increasing guerrilla violence and a volatile
exchange rate, and the fiscal deficit has more than tripled since
1994.

COMOROS

Introduction

Historical perspective: Comoros has had difficulty in achieving
political stability, having endured 18 coups or attempted coups since
receiving independence from France in 1975. Most recently, in August
1997, the islands of Anjouan and Moheli declared their independence
from Comoros. An attempt in September 1997 by the government to
reestablish control over the rebellious islands by force failed, and
presently the Organization of African Unity is brokering negotiations
to effect a reconciliation.

@Comoros:Economy

Economy-overview: One of the world's poorest countries, Comoros is
made up of three islands that have inadequate transportation links, a
young and rapidly increasing population, and few natural resources.
The low educational level of the labor force contributes to a
subsistence level of economic activity, high unemployment, and a heavy
dependence on foreign grants and technical assistance. Agriculture,
including fishing, hunting, and forestry, is the leading sector of the
economy. It contributes 40% to GDP, employs 80% of the labor force,
and provides most of the exports. The country is not self-sufficient
in food production; rice, the main staple, accounts for the bulk of
imports. The government is struggling to upgrade education and
technical training, to privatize commercial and industrial
enterprises, to improve health services, to diversify exports, to
promote tourism, and to reduce the high population growth rate.
Continued foreign support is essential if the goal of 4% annual GDP
growth is to be maintained in the late 1990s.

@Congo, Democratic Republic of the:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy of Democratic Republic of the Congo-a
nation endowed with vast potential wealth-has declined significantly
since the mid-1980s. The new government has instituted a tight fiscal
policy that has curbed inflation and currency depreciation. Plans are
underway to introduce a new national currency. Most formal
transactions are conducted in hard currency but a barter economy
flourishes in all but the largest cities. Most individuals and
families survive through subsistence farming or petty trade.
International investors show renewed interest, especially in the
mining and telecommunications sectors. However, poor infrastructure,
an uncertain legal framework, corruption and lack of transparency in
government economic policy remain a brake on investment and growth. A
number of IMF and World Bank missions have met with the new government
to help it develop a coherent economic plan.

@Congo, Republic of the:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy is a mixture of village agriculture and
handicrafts, an industrial sector based largely on oil, support
services, and a government characterized by budget problems and
overstaffing. Oil has supplanted forestry as the mainstay of the
economy, providing about 90% of government revenues and exports. In
the early 1980s, rapidly rising oil revenues enabled the government to
finance large-scale development projects with GDP growth averaging 5%
annually, one of the highest rates in Africa. Subsequently, falling
oil prices cut GDP growth by half. Moreover, the government has
mortgaged a substantial portion of its oil earnings, contributing to
the government's shortage of revenues. The 12 January 1994 devaluation
of Franc Zone currencies by 50% resulted in inflation of 61% in 1994
but inflation has subsided since. Economic reform efforts continue
with the support of international organizations, notably the World
Bank and the IMF.

@Cook Islands:Economy

Economy-overview: Like many other South Pacific island nations, the
Cook Islands' economic development is hindered by the isolation of the
country from foreign markets, lack of natural resources, periodic
devastation from natural disasters, and inadequate infrastructure.
Agriculture provides the economic base with major exports made up of
copra and citrus fruit. Manufacturing activities are limited to
fruit-processing, clothing, and handicrafts. Trade deficits are made
up for by remittances from emigrants and by foreign aid,
overwhelmingly from New Zealand. In 1996, the government declared
bankruptcy, citing a $120 million public debt. Efforts to exploit
tourism potential and expanding the mining and fishing industries have
not been enough to adequately deal with the financial crisis. In an
effort to stem further erosion of the economy, the government slashed
public service salaries by 50%, condensed the number of government
ministries from 52 to 22, reduced the number of civil servants by more
than half, began selling government assets, and closed all overseas
diplomatic posts except for the one in New Zealand.

safety net has been put in place. Recent trends, however, have been
disappointing. Economic growth slipped from 4.3% in 1994 to 2.5% in
1995, and to 0.9% in 1996, and then rebounded in 1997 to 3%. Inflation
rose to 22.5% in 1995 from 13.5% in 1994, receded to 17.5% in 1996,
then dropped to 11.2% in 1997. Unemployment appears moderate at 5.7%,
but substantial underemployment continues. Furthermore, substantial
government deficits have undermined efforts to maintain the quality of
social services. The government thus faces a formidable set of
problems: to curb inflation, reduce the deficit, encourage domestic
savings, and improve public sector efficiency while increasing the
role of the private sector, all this in harmony with IMF agreements.
One important positive development-the infusion of more than $200
million in 1997 by microchip giant Intel and the anticipated
attraction of other high-tech firms to Costa Rica will help stimulate
growth and employment over the next several years.

@Cote d'Ivoire:Economy

Economy-overview: Cote d'Ivoire is among the world's largest producers
and exporters of coffee, cocoa beans, and palm oil. Consequently, the
economy is highly sensitive to fluctuations in international prices
for these products and to weather conditions. Despite attempts by the
government to diversify the economy, it is still largely dependent on
agriculture and related activities, which engage roughly 85% of the
population. After several years of lagging performance, the Ivorian
economy began a comeback in 1994, due to improved prices for cocoa and
coffee, growth in nontraditional primary exports such as pineapples
and rubber, limited trade and banking liberalization, offshore oil and
gas discoveries, and generous external financing and debt rescheduling
by multilateral lenders and France. The 50% devaluation of Franc Zone
currencies on 12 January 1994 caused a one-time jump in the inflation
rate to 26% in 1994, but the rate fell to 7% in 1996 and an estimated
3.4% in 1997. Moreover, government adherence to donor-mandated reforms
led to a jump in growth rates-6.5% in GDP in 1996 and again in 1997.

@Croatia:Economy

Economy-overview: Before the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the Republic
of Croatia, after Slovenia, was the most prosperous and industrialized
area, with a per capita output perhaps one-third above the Yugoslav
average. Croatia faces considerable economic problems stemming from:
the legacy of longtime communist mismanagement of the economy; damage
during the internecine fighting to bridges, factories, power lines,
buildings, and houses; the large refugee and displaced population,
both Croatian and Bosnian; and the disruption of economic ties.
Western aid and investment, especially in the tourist and oil
industries, would help restore the economy. The government has been
successful in some reform efforts-partially macroeconomic
stabilization policies-and it has normalized relations with its
creditors. Yet it still is struggling with privatization of large
state enterprises and with bank reform.

@Cuba:Economy

Economy-overview: The state plays the primary role in the economy and
controls practically all foreign trade. The government has undertaken
several reforms in recent years to stem excess liquidity, increase
labor incentives, and alleviate serious shortages of food, consumer
goods, and services. The liberalized agricultural markets introduced
in October 1994, at which state and private farmers sell above-quota
production at unrestricted prices, have broadened legal consumption
alternatives and reduced black market prices. Government efforts to
lower subsidies to unprofitable enterprises and to shrink the money
supply caused the semi-official exchange rate for the Cuban peso to
move from a peak of 120 to the dollar in the summer of 1994 to 23 to
the dollar by yearend 1997. New taxes introduced in 1996 helped drive
down the number of self-employed workers from 208,000 in January 1996
to 176,000 by September 1997. Havana announced in 1995 that GDP
declined by 35% during 1989-93, the result of lost Soviet aid and
domestic inefficiencies. The drop in GDP apparently halted in 1994,
when Cuba reported 0.7% growth, followed by increases of 2.5% in 1995
and 7.8% in 1996. Growth slowed again in 1997, to 2.5%, in part due to
a poor sugar harvest. Export earnings declined 3% in 1997, to $1.9
billion, the result of lower sugar export volume and lower world
prices for nickel and sugar. Imports remained unchanged in 1997 at
$3.2 billion. Tourism plays a key role in foreign currency earnings.
The disparity between those at the top of the ladder and those at the
bottom has increased markedly in the past 10 years. Living standards
for the average Cuban remain at a depressed level compared with 1990.

@Cyprus:Economy

Economy-overview: The Greek Cypriot economy is small and prosperous,
but highly susceptible to external shocks. Industry contributes 22% to
GDP and employs 25% of the labor force, while the service sector
contributes 73% to GDP and employs 62% of the labor force. Erratic
growth rates in the 1990s reflect the economy's vulnerability to
swings in tourist arrivals, caused by political instability on the
island and fluctuations in economic conditions in Western Europe. The
Turkish Cypriot economy has about one-third the per capita GDP of the
south. Because it is recognized only by Turkey, it has had much
difficulty arranging foreign financing, and foreign firms have
hesitated to invest there. The economy remains heavily dependent on
agriculture and government service, which together employ about half
of the work force. Moreover, the small, vulnerable economy has
suffered because the Turkish lira is legal tender. To compensate for
the economy's weakness, Turkey provides direct and indirect aid to
nearly every sector. In January 1997, Turkey signed a $250 million
economic cooperation accord with the Turkish Cypriot area to support
tourism, education, and industry.

Czech economic troubles, which culminated in a currency crisis in May.
The currency was forced out of its fluctuation band as investors
worried that the current account deficit, which reached about 8% of
GDP in 1996, would become unsustainable. After expending $3 billion in
vain to support the currency, the central bank let it float. The
growing current account imbalance reflected a surge in domestic demand
and poor export performance, as wage increases outpaced productivity.
The government was forced to introduce two austerity packages later in
the spring which cut government spending by 2.5% of GDP. A tough 1998
budget continues the painful medicine. These problems were compounded
in the summer of 1997 by unprecedented flooding which inundated much
of the eastern part of the country. Czech difficulties in 1997
contrast with earlier achievements of strong GDP growth, a balanced
budget, and inflation and unemployment that were among the lowest in
the region. The Czech economy's transition problems continue to be too
much direct and indirect government influence on the privatized
economy, the sometimes ineffective management of privatized firms, and
a shortage of experienced financial analysts for the banking system.
Prague forecasts a balanced budget, 2.2% GDP growth, 5.2%
unemployment, and 10% inflation for 1998.

@Denmark:Economy

Economy-overview: This thoroughly modern market economy features
high-tech agriculture, up-to-date small-scale and corporate industry,
extensive government welfare measures, comfortable living standards,
and high dependence on foreign trade. Denmark is a net exporter of
food. The center-left coalition government will concentrate on
reducing the persistently high unemployment rate and the budget
deficit as well as following the previous government's policies of
maintaining low inflation and a current account surplus. The coalition
also vows to maintain a stable currency. The coalition has lowered
marginal income taxes while maintaining overall tax revenues; boosted
industrial competitiveness through labor market and tax reforms and
increased research and development funds; and improved welfare
services for the neediest while cutting paperwork and delays. Prime
Minister RASMUSSEN's reforms focus on adapting Denmark to the criteria
for European integration by 1999; Copenhagen has won from the European
Union (EU) the right to opt out of the European Monetary Union (EMU).
Denmark is, in fact, one of the few EU countries likely to fit into
the EMU on time. Growth may fall off slightly to 2.8% in 1998, and
inflation may rise to 2.5%.

@Djibouti:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy is based on service activities connected
with the country's strategic location and status as a free trade zone
in northeast Africa. Two-thirds of the inhabitants live in the capital
city, the remainder being mostly nomadic herders. Scanty rainfall
limits crop production to fruits and vegetables, and most food must be
imported. Djibouti provides services as both a transit port for the
region and an international transshipment and refueling center. It has
few natural resources and little industry. The nation is, therefore,
heavily dependent on foreign assistance to help support its balance of
payments and to finance development projects. An unemployment rate of
40% to 50% continues to be a major problem. Per capita consumption
dropped an estimated 35% over the last seven years because of
recession, civil war, and a high population growth rate (including
immigrants and refugees). Faced with a multitude of economic
difficulties, the government has fallen in arrears on long-term
external debt and has been struggling to meet the stipulations of
foreign aid donors.

@Dominica:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy is dependent on agriculture and thus is
highly vulnerable to climatic conditions, notably tropical storms.
Agriculture, primarily bananas, accounts for 26% of GDP and employs
40% of the labor force. Development of the tourist industry remains
difficult because of the rugged coastline, lack of beaches, and the
lack of an international airport. Hurricane Luis devastated the
country's banana crop in September 1995; tropical storms had wiped out
one-quarter of the crop in 1994 as well. The government is attempting
to develop an offshore financial industry in order to diversify the
island's production base.

@Dominican Republic:Economy

Economy-overview: Economic reforms launched in late 1994 contributed
to exchange rate stabilization, reduced inflation, and strong GDP
growth in 1995-96. In 1996, there was increased mineral and petroleum
exploration, and a new investment law that allows for repatriation of
capital dividends has drawn more investment to the island. Upon coming
to power in August 1996, President FERNANDEZ nevertheless inherited a
trouble-ridden economy hampered by a pressured peso, a large external
debt, nearly bankrupt state-owned enterprises, and a manufacturing
sector hindered by daily power outages. In December, FERNANDEZ
presented a bold economic reform package-including such reforms as the
devaluation of the peso, income tax cuts, a 50% increase in sales
taxes, reduced import tariffs, and increased gasoline prices-in an
attempt to create a market-oriented economy that can compete
internationally. Even though reforms are moving ahead at a slow pace,
the economy grew vigorously in 1997, with tourism and
telecommunications leading the advance. The government is working to
increase electric generating capacity, a key to continued economic
growth.

@Ecuador:Economy

Economy-overview: Ecuador has substantial oil resources and rich
agricultural areas. As an exporter of primary products such as oil,
bananas, and shrimp, fluctuations in world market prices can have a
substantial domestic impact. Growth has been uneven in recent years as
the government has repeatedly initiated ill-conceived fiscal
stabilization measures. The populist government of Abdala BUCARAM
Ortiz proposed a major currency reform in 1996, but popular discontent
with new austerity measures and rampant official corruption undermined
his government's position. Congress replaced BUCARAM with Fabian
ALARCON in February 1997. ALARCON has adopted a minimalist economic
program that puts off major decisions until the next elected
government takes office in August 1998. Ecuador joined the World Trade
Organization in 1996, but has failed to comply with many of its
accession commitments. Growth slowed to 2.0% in 1996, due to a lack of
investment caused by political uncertainty and high domestic interest
rates, but economic activity picked up in 1997. Exports and economic
growth in 1998 may be adversely affected by lower world oil prices
and, to a smaller extent, by El Nino.

@Egypt:Economy

Economy-overview: At the end of the 1980s, Egypt faced problems of low
productivity and poor economic management, compounded by the adverse
social effects of excessive population growth, high inflation, and
massive urban overcrowding. In the face of these pressures, in 1991
Egypt undertook wide-ranging macroeconomic stabilization and
structural reform measures. This reform effort has been supported by
three successive IMF arrangements, the last of which was concluded in
October 1996. Egypt's reform efforts-and its participation in the Gulf
war coalition-also led to massive debt relief under the Paris Club
arrangements. Although the pace of reform has been uneven and slower
than envisaged under the IMF programs, substantial progress has been
made in improving macroeconomic performance. Budget deficits have been
slashed while foreign reserves in 1997 were at an all-time high. And
Egypt has been moving toward a more decentralized, market-oriented
economy. These economic reforms and growing investment opportunities
have prompted increasing foreign investment, but incoming capital has
largely been concentrated in stock market portfolio flows. Egypt's
economy also has been hit by a sharp downturn in tourism-a key foreign
exchange and job producing sector-following the 17 November 1997
massacre of foreign tourists at Luxor. Although Egypt will probably
regain these revenues over time, the slump in tourism is likely to
slow the GDP growth rate in 1998.

@El Salvador:Economy

Economy-overview: In 1997 the government emphasized a fixed exchange
rate, along with conservative monetary and fiscal policies to promote
foreign investment. Inflation fell to an unprecedented low of 2%.
Exports reached a record level and were the main engine of growth.
Productivity in other sectors remained weaker, however. For the last
few years, El Salvador has experienced sizable deficits in both its
trade and its fiscal accounts. The trade deficit has been offset by
remittances from the large number of Salvadorans living abroad and
from external aid. The deficit is expected to increase in 1998 as
imports continue to rise. San Salvador is stepping up its
privatization efforts in 1998 to increase revenues. Late in 1997 the
legislative assembly approved a privatization law that will facilitate
the sale of the state-owned telephone company sometime in 1998. The
government also plans to privatize pension funds later in the year.

@Equatorial Guinea:Economy

Economy-overview: The discovery and exploitation of large oil reserves
have contributed to dramatic economic growth in recent years. Farming,
forestry, and fishing are also major components of GDP. Subsistence
farming predominates. Although pre-independence Equatorial Guinea
counted on cocoa production for hard currency earnings, the
deterioration of the rural economy under successive brutal regimes has
diminished potential for agriculture-led growth. A number of aid
programs sponsored by the World Bank and the IMF have been cut off
since 1993 because of the government's gross corruption and
mismanagement. Businesses, for the most part, are owned by government
officials and their family members. Undeveloped natural resources
include titanium, iron ore, manganese, uranium, and alluvial gold. The
country responded favorably to the devaluation of the CFA franc in
January 1994.

Introduction

Historical perspective: On 29 May 1991, ISAIAS Afworki, secretary
general of the People's Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ), which
then served as the country's legislative body, announced the formation
of the Provisional Government in Eritrea (PGE) in preparation for the

@Eritrea:Economy

Economy-overview: With independence from Ethiopia on 27 April 1993,
Eritrea faced the bitter economic problems of a small, desperately
poor African country. The economy is largely based on subsistence
agriculture, with over 70% of the population involved in farming and
herding. The small industrial sector consists mainly of light
industries with outmoded technologies. Domestic output (GDP) is
substantially augmented by worker remittances from abroad. Government
revenues come from custom duties and taxes on income and sales. Road
construction is a top domestic priority. Eritrea has inherited the
entire coastline of Ethiopia and has long-term prospects for revenues
from the development of offshore oil fields, offshore fishing, and
tourism. Eritrea's economic future depends on its ability to master
fundamental social and economic problems, e.g., overcoming illiteracy,
promoting job creation, expanding technical training, attracting
foreign investment, and streamlining the bureaucracy.

@Estonia:Economy

Economy-overview: In 1997 Estonia's continued implementation of market
economic reforms, disciplined fiscal and monetary policies, and a
liberal free trade regime resulted in GDP growth of 10% and a drop in
inflation to 11.2%. Estonia can point to its inclusion among the first
group of Central and East European countries to begin EU accession
talks in 1998 as its most significant economic achievement in 1997.
Other economic strengths include solid investment grade rating from
both Standard and Poors and Moody's, government revenue collection in
excess of projections by more than 6%, growth in exports at a faster
rate than imports, and record levels of foreign direct investment,
among the highest per capita in Central and East Europe. Estonia
privatized its shipping company in 1997, but failed to make as much
progress privatizing other large infrastructure/utility companies,
such as Eesti Energia and the Oil Shale company, which it plans to
privatize in the next two years. The growing current account deficit,
which stood at nearly 10% of GDP at yearend 1997, remains a serious
concern. In 1998, GDP is expected to grow by 5.5% and inflation to
fall 10%.

@Ethiopia:Economy

Economy-overview: Ethiopia remains one of the poorest and least
developed countries in the world. Its economy is based on agriculture,
which accounts for more than half of GDP, 90% of exports, and 80% of
total employment; coffee generates 60% of export earnings. The
agricultural sector suffers from frequent periods of drought, poor
cultivation practices, and deterioration of internal security
conditions. The manufacturing sector is heavily dependent on inputs
from the agricultural sector. Over 90% of large-scale industry, but
less than 10% of agriculture, is state-run. The government is
considering selling off a portion of state-owned plants and is
implementing reform measures that are gradually liberalizing the
economy. A major medium-term problem is the improvement of roads,
water supply, and other parts of an infrastructure badly neglected
during years of civil strife.

@Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas):Economy

Economy-overview: The economy was formerly based on agriculture,
mainly sheep farming, which directly or indirectly employs most of the
work force. Dairy farming supports domestic consumption; crops furnish
winter fodder. Exports feature shipments of high-grade wool to the UK
and the sale of postage stamps and coins. Rich stocks of fish in the
surrounding waters are not presently exploited by the islanders. So
far, efforts to establish a domestic fishing industry have been
unsuccessful. The economy has diversified since 1987, when the
government began selling fishing licenses to foreign trawlers
operating within the Falklands exclusive fishing zone; overfishing is
a growing problem. These license fees total more than $40 million per
year and support the island's health, education, and welfare system.
To encourage tourism, the Falkland Islands Development Corporation has
built three lodges for visitors attracted by the abundant wildlife and
trout fishing. The islands are now self-financing except for defense.
The British Geological Survey announced a 200-mile oil exploration
zone around the islands in 1993, and early seismic surveys suggest
substantial reserves capable of producing 500,000 barrels per day. An
agreement between Argentina and the UK in 1995 seeks to defuse
licensing and sovereignty conflicts that would dampen foreign interest
in exploiting potential oil reserves.

@Faroe Islands:Economy

Economy-overview: The Faroese economy in 1995 and 1996 saw a
noticeable upturn after several years of decline brought on by a drop
in fish catches and declining prices and by over-spending by the
Faroese Home Rule Government (FHRG). In the early 1990s, property
values plummeted, and the FHRG had to bail out and merge the two
largest Faroese banks. Fishing is now improving; wage costs are
increasing; the FHRG's budget is almost in balance; and the large
foreign debt has come down significantly. Nevertheless, the total
dependence on fishing makes the Faroese economy extremely vulnerable,
and the reduction in the foreign debt is at the cost of low
investment. Oil finds close to the Faroese area give hope for deposits
in the immediate Faroese area, which may lay the basis for an eventual
economic rebound. The Faroese are supported by a substantial annual
subsidy from Denmark.

@Fiji:Economy

Economy-overview: Fiji, endowed with forest, mineral, and fish
resources, is one of the most developed of the Pacific island
economies, though still with a large subsistence sector. Sugar exports
and a growing tourist industry are the major sources of foreign
exchange. Sugar processing makes up one-third of industrial activity.
Roughly 250,000 tourists visit each year. Political uncertainty and
drought, however, contribute to substantial fluctuations in earnings
from tourism and sugar and to the emigration of skilled workers.
Fiji's growth slowed in 1997 because the sugar industry suffered from
low world prices and rent disputes between farmers and landowners.

@Finland:Economy

Economy-overview: Finland has a highly industrialized, largely
free-market economy, with per capita output roughly that of the UK,
France, Germany, and Italy. Its key economic sector is
manufacturing-principally the wood, metals, and engineering
industries. Trade is important, with the export of goods representing
about 30% of GDP. Except for timber and several minerals, Finland
depends on imports of raw materials, energy, and some components for
manufactured goods. Because of the climate, agricultural development
is limited to maintaining self-sufficiency in basic products.
Forestry, an important export earner, provides a secondary occupation
for the rural population. The economy has come back from the recession
of 1990-92, which had been caused by economic overheating, depressed
foreign markets, and the dismantling of the barter system between
Finland and the former Soviet Union under which Soviet oil and gas had
been exchanged for Finnish manufactured goods. The Finns voted in an
October 1994 referendum to enter the EU, and Finland officially joined
the Union on 1 January 1995. Attempts to cut the unacceptably high
rate of unemployment and increasing integration with Western Europe
will dominate the economic picture over the next few years. Despite
high unemployment and moderate GDP growth of 3.9% anticipated for
1998, inflation is forecast to rise to 2.5%

GDP: purchasing power parity-$102.1 billion (1997 est.)

@France:Economy

Economy-overview: One of the four West European trillion-dollar
economies, France matches a growing services sector with a diversified
industrial base and substantial agricultural resources. Services now
account for more than 70% of GDP, while industry generates about
one-quarter of GDP and more than 80% of export earnings. The
government retains considerable influence over key segments of each
sector, with majority ownership of railway, electricity, aircraft, and
telecommunication firms. It nevertheless has been slowly relaxing its
control over these sectors since the early 1990s, most recently
selling 23% of France Telecom. The government also plans to sell its
stakes in Air France and in the insurance, banking, and defense
industries. Meanwhile, large tracts of fertile land, the application
of modern technology, and subsidies have combined to make France the
leading agricultural producer in Western Europe. A major exporter of
wheat and dairy products, France is virtually self-sufficient in
agriculture. The economy expanded by 2.3% last year, following a 1.3%
gain in 1996. Persistently high unemployment still poses a major
problem for the government, however, as does the need to control
government spending to keep the economy internationally competitive
and meet membership qualifications for the European Economic and
Monetary Union (EMU) which is slated to introduce a common European
currency in January 1999. Succeeding governments have shied away from
cutting exceptionally generous social welfare benefits or the enormous
state bureaucracy, preferring to pare defense spending and raise taxes
to keep the deficit down. The JOSPIN administration has pledged both
to lower unemployment and bring France into EMU, pinning its hopes for
new jobs on economic growth and on legislation to gradually reduce the
workweek from 39 to 35 hours by 2002.

@French Guiana:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy is tied closely to that of France
through subsidies and imports. Besides the French space center at
Kourou, fishing and forestry are the most important economic
activities, with exports of fish and fish products (mostly shrimp)
accounting for more than 60% of total revenue in 1992. The large
reserves of tropical hardwoods, not fully exploited, support an
expanding sawmill industry that provides sawn logs for export.
Cultivation of crops is limited to the coastal area, where the
population is largely concentrated. French Guiana is heavily dependent
on imports of food and energy. Unemployment is a serious problem,
particularly among younger workers.

@French Polynesia:Economy

Economy-overview: Since 1962, when France stationed military personnel
in the region, French Polynesia has changed from a subsistence economy
to one in which a high proportion of the work force is either employed
by the military or supports the tourist industry. Tourism accounts for
about 20% of GDP and is a primary source of hard currency earnings.
The small manufacturing sector primarily processes agricultural
products. The territory will continue to benefit from a five-year
(1994-98) development agreement with France aimed principally at
creating new jobs.

@Gabon:Economy

Economy-overview: Gabon enjoys a per capita income four times that of
most nations of sub-Saharan Africa. This has supported a sharp decline
in extreme poverty but because of high income inequality a large
proportion of the population remains poor. Gabon depended on timber
and manganese until oil was discovered offshore in the early 1970s.
The oil sector now accounts for 50% of GDP. Gabon continues to face
fluctuating prices for its oil, timber, manganese, and uranium
exports. Despite the abundance of natural wealth and a manageable rate
of population growth, the economy is hobbled by poor fiscal
management. In 1992, the fiscal deficit widened to 2.4% of GDP, and
Gabon failed to settle arrears on its bilateral debt, leading to a
cancellation of rescheduling agreements with official and private
creditors. Devaluation of its Francophone currency by 50% on 12
January 1994 sparked a one-time inflationary surge, to 35%; the rate
dropped to 6% in 1996. The IMF provided a one-year standby arrangement
in 1994-95 and a three-year Enhanced Financing Facility (EFF) at near
commercial rates beginning in late 1995. Those agreements mandate
progress in privatization and fiscal discipline. France provided
additional financial support in January 1997 after Gabon had met IMF
targets for mid-1996. In 1997, an IMF mission to Gabon chastened the
government for overspending on off-budget items, overborrowing from
the central bank, and slipping on its schedule for privatization and
administrative reform (such as reduced public sector employment and
salary growth).

@Gambia, The:Economy

Economy-overview: The Gambia has no important mineral or other natural
resources and has a limited agricultural base. About 75% of the
population depends on crops and livestock for its livelihood.
Small-scale manufacturing activity features the processing of peanuts,
fish, and hides. Reexport trade normally constitutes a major segment
of economic activity, but the 50% devaluation of the CFA franc in
January 1994 made Senegalese goods more competitive and hurt the
reexport trade. The Gambia has benefited from a rebound in tourism
after its decline in response to the military's takeover in July 1994.
Short-run economic progress remains highly dependent on sustained
bilateral and multilateral aid and on responsible government economic
management.

GAZA STRIP

Introduction

Current issues: The Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles on Interim
Self-Government Arrangements ("the DOP"), signed in Washington on 13
September 1993, provides for a transitional period not exceeding five
years of Palestinian interim self-government in the Gaza Strip and the
West Bank. Permanent status negotiations began on 5 May 1996, but have
not resumed since the initial meeting. Under the DOP, Israel agreed to
transfer certain powers and responsibilities to the Palestinian
Authority, which includes a Palestinian Legislative Council elected in
January 1996, as part of interim self-governing arrangements in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip. A transfer of powers and responsibilities
for the Gaza Strip and Jericho took place pursuant to the Israel-PLO 4
May 1994 Cairo Agreement on the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area and in
additional areas of the West Bank pursuant to the Israel-PLO 28
September 1995 Interim Agreement and the Israel-PLO 15 January 1997
Protocol Concerning Redeployment in Hebron. The DOP provides that
Israel will retain responsibility during the transitional period for
external security and for internal security and public order of
settlements and Israelis. Permanent status is to be determined through
direct negotiations.

@Gaza Strip:Economy

Economy-overview: Economic progress in the Gaza Strip has been
hampered by tight Israeli security restrictions. In 1991 roughly 40%
of Gaza Strip workers were employed across the border by Israeli
industrial, construction, and agricultural enterprises, with worker
remittances supplementing GDP by roughly 50%. Gaza has depended upon
Israel for nearly 90% of its external trade. The Persian Gulf crisis
and its aftershocks have dealt blows to Gaza since August 1990. Worker
remittances from the Gulf states have dropped, unemployment and
popular unrest have increased, and living standards have fallen. The
redeployment of Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip in May 1994 has added
to the set of adjustment problems. This series of disruptions has
meant a sharp decline in employment in Israel since 1991 and a drop in
GDP as a whole. An estimated 378,000 persons were in refugee camps in
1996.

GEORGIA

Introduction

Current issues: Beset by ethnic and civil strife since independence in
1991, Georgia began to stabilize in 1994. Separatist conflicts in
Abkhazia and South Ossetia have been dormant since spring 1994,
although political settlements remain elusive. Russian peacekeepers
are deployed in both regions and a UN Observer Mission is operating in
Abkhazia. As a result of these conflicts, Georgia still has about
250,000 internally displaced people. In 1995, Georgia adopted a new
constitution and conducted generally free and fair nationwide
presidential and parliamentary elections. In 1996, the government
focused its attention to implementing an ambitious economic reform
program and professionalizing its parliament. Violence and organized
crime were sharply curtailed in 1995 and 1996, but corruption remains
rife. In 1997, SHEVARDNADZE succeeded in bringing international
attention to the Abkhazia conflict. The UN sponsored two meetings on
the subject, but a resolution is still far off. Georgia also took some
steps in 1997 to reduce its dependence on Russia, acquiring coastal
patrol boats it hopes to use to replace the current Russian border
units on the Black Sea coast. The year 1997 also saw a sharpening of
rhetoric-especially from parliament-against Russia's continued
military presence on Georgian territory.

@Georgia:Economy

Economy-overview: Georgia's economy has traditionally revolved around
Black Sea tourism; cultivation of citrus fruits, tea, and grapes;
mining of manganese and copper; and output of a small industrial
sector producing wine, metals, machinery, chemicals, and textiles. The
country imports the bulk of its energy needs, including natural gas
and oil products. Its only sizable internal energy resource is
hydropower. Despite the severe damage the economy has suffered due to
civil strife, Georgia, with the help of the IMF and World Bank, has
made substantial economic gains in 1995-97, increasing GDP growth and
slashing inflation. Georgia still suffers from energy shortages,
although energy deliveries are steadily improving. Georgia is pinning
its hopes for long-term recovery on the development of an
international transportation corridor through the key Black Sea ports
of P'ot'i and Bat'umi. The construction of a Caspian oil pipeline
through Georgia-scheduled to open in early 1999-should spur greater
western investment in the economy. A growing trade deficit, continuing
problems with corruption, and political uncertainties cloud the

@Germany:Economy

Economy-overview: In 1997 the German economy, the world's third most
powerful, benefited from robust exports, particularly to other members
of the EU and the US, as well as strengthening equipment investment.
But anemic private consumption and a contraction in the construction
industry limited the expansion. Unemployment continued to set post-war
monthly records through the end of 1997 and averaged 4.3 million for
the year. In preparation for the 1 January 1999 start of the European
Monetary Union, the government has made major efforts in 1996-97 to
reduce the fiscal deficit. This effort has been complicated by growing
unemployment, an erosion of the tax base, and the continuing transfer
of roughly $100 billion a year to eastern Germany to refurbish this
ex-communist area. In recent years business and political leaders have
become increasingly concerned about Germany's decline in
attractiveness as an investment target. They cite increasing
preference by German companies to locate new manufacturing facilities
in foreign countries, including the US, rather than in Germany, to be
closer to the markets and to avoid Germany's high tax rates, high wage
costs, rigid labor structures, and extensive regulations. For similar
reasons foreign investment in Germany has been lagging in recent
years.

@Ghana:Economy

Economy-overview: Well endowed with natural resources, Ghana has twice
the per capita output of the poorer countries in West Africa. Even so,
Ghana remains heavily dependent on international financial and
technical assistance. Gold, timber, and cocoa production are major
sources of foreign exchange. The domestic economy continues to revolve
around subsistence agriculture, which accounts for 41% of GDP and
employs 60% of the work force, mainly small landholders. In 1995-97,
Ghana made mixed progress under a three-year structural adjustment
program in cooperation with the IMF. On the minus side, public sector
wage increases and regional peacekeeping commitments have led to
continued inflationary deficit financing, depreciation of the cedi,
and rising public discontent with Ghana's austerity measures.

@Gibraltar:Economy

Economy-overview: Gibraltar benefits from an extensive shipping trade,
offshore banking, and its position as an international conference
center. The British military presence has been sharply reduced and now
contributes about 11% to the local economy. The financial sector
accounts for 15% of GDP; tourism (more than 5 million visitors in
1995), shipping services fees, and duties on consumer goods also
generate revenue. Because more than 70% of the economy is in the
public sector, changes in government spending have a major impact on
the level of employment.

@Greece:Economy

Economy-overview: Greece has a mixed capitalist economy with the
public sector accounting for roughly half of GDP. Tourism provides a
major portion of foreign exchange. Greece is among the poorest EU
countries in terms of per capita income; Athens continues to rely
heavily on EU aid, which currently amounts to about 4.5% of GDP.
Macroeconomic problems include the huge public sector, substantial
budget and balance of payments deficits, and 10% unemployment.
Economic growth is strengthening, and the government's strict fiscal
and monetary policies are responsible for the decline in inflation and
the budget deficit. Despite widespread protests from labor unions and
farmers over austerity, the government is taking further steps to
enhance revenue collection and reduce expenditures to prepare Greece
for participation in the EU's single currency by 2001. Greece entered
the exchange rate mechanism-a requirement for European Monetary Union
(EMU) membership-in March 1998. GDP growth is projected at 3.5% for

@Greenland:Economy

Economy-overview: Greenland suffered negative economic growth in the
early 1990s, but since 1993 the economy has improved. The Greenland
Home Rule Government (GHRG) has pursued a light fiscal policy since
the late 1980s which has helped create surpluses in the public budget
and low inflation. Since 1990, Greenland has registered a foreign
trade deficit following the closure of the last remaining lead and
zinc mine in 1989. Greenland today is critically dependent on fishing
and fish exports; the shrimp fishery is by far the largest income
earner. Despite resumption of several interesting hydrocarbon and
minerals exploration activities, it will take several years before
production can materialize. Tourism is the only sector offering any
near-term potential and even this is limited due to a short season and
high costs. The public sector, including publicly owned enterprises
and the municipalities, plays the dominant role in Greenland's
economy. About half the government revenues come from grants from the
Danish Government, an important supplement of GDP.

@Grenada:Economy

Economy-overview: The agriculturally based economy was hurt in 1996 by
the emergence of the pink mealy bug, which destroyed much of the cocoa
harvest. Bananas, a major foreign exchange earner, also suffered due
to falling prices, low production, and poor quality. Tourism, the
leading foreign exchange earner, continued to do well, as did
manufacturing. Construction boomed in 1996 due to concessions for low
and middle income mortgages. The government introduced a 5% tax on
electricity and telephones and doubled the general consumption tax,
which caused a small rise in the inflation rate. The tourist industry
faces stiff competition over the next few years.

@Guadeloupe:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy depends on agriculture, tourism, light
industry, and services. It is also dependent upon France for large
subsidies and imports. Tourism is a key industry, with most tourists
from the US; an increasingly large number of cruise ships visit the
islands. The traditional sugarcane crop is slowly being replaced by
other crops, such as bananas (which now supply about 50% of export
earnings), eggplant, and flowers. Other vegetables and root crops are
cultivated for local consumption, although Guadeloupe is still
dependent on imported food, mainly from France. Light industry
features sugar and rum production. Most manufactured goods and fuel
are imported. Unemployment is especially high among the young.

boom for new hotels and the expansion of older ones. More than one
million tourists visit Guam each year. Most food and industrial goods
are imported, with about 75% from the US. Guam faces the problem of
building up the civilian economic sector to offset the impact of
military downsizing.

@Guatemala:Economy

Economy-overview: The agricultural sector accounts for one-fourth of
GDP and two-thirds of exports and employs more than half of the labor
force. Coffee, sugar, and bananas are the main products. Manufacturing
and construction account for one-fifth of GDP. Since assuming office
in January 1996, President ARZU has worked to implement a program of
economic liberalization and political modernization. The signing of
the Peace Accords in December 1996, which ended 36 years of civil war,
removed a major obstacle to foreign investment. In 1997, Guatemala met
its economic targets when GDP growth accelerated to 4.1% and inflation
fell to 9%. The government also increased tax revenues-historically
the lowest in Latin America-to 9% of GDP and created a new tax
administration. It also successfully placed $150 million in
dollar-denominated notes in the international markets. Debt service
costs should decline in 1998. Remaining challenges for the
administration in 1998 include completing a deal with the IMF and
stabilizing monetary policy. Throughout 1997, the Central Bank
maintained a tight money supply, helping to control inflation, but it
also caused high interest rates and led to operating losses for the
bank. Early in 1998, it relaxed its monetary policy in an effort to
correct these problems, but increased pressure on the quetzal has
prompted the bank to intervene to prop up its value.

@Guinea:Economy

Economy-overview: Although possessing major mineral, hydropower, and
agricultural resources, Guinea remains one of the poorest countries in
the world. The agricultural sector employs 80% of the work force.
Guinea possesses over 25% of the world's bauxite reserves and is the
second largest bauxite producer. The mining sector accounted for about
75% of exports in 1995. Long-run improvements in government fiscal
arrangements, literacy, and the legal framework are needed if the
country is to move out of poverty. The government made encouraging
progress in budget management in 1997. Except in the mining industry,
foreign investment remains minimal.

@Guinea-Bissau:Economy

Economy-overview: One of the 20 poorest countries in the world,
Guinea-Bissau depends mainly on farming and fishing. Cashew crops have
increased remarkably in recent years, and the country now ranks sixth
in cashew production. Guinea-Bissau exports fish and seafood along
with small amounts of peanuts, palm kernels, and timber. Rice is the
major crop and staple food. Trade reform and price liberalization are
the most successful part of the country's structural adjustment
program under IMF sponsorship. The tightening of monetary policy and
the development of the private sector have begun to reinvigorate the
economy. Inflation dropped sharply in the first quarter of 1997.
Membership in the WAMU (West African Monetary Union), begun in May
1997, should help support 5% annual growth and contribute to fiscal
discipline. Because of high costs, the development of petroleum,
phosphate, and other mineral resources is not a near-term prospect.

@Guyana:Economy

Economy-overview: In 1997, Guyana, one of the poorest countries in the
Western Hemisphere, posted its sixth straight year of economic growth
of 5% or better, with the advance led by gold and bauxite mining and
by sugar growing. Favorable growth factors have included expansion in
the key agricultural and mining sectors, a more favorable atmosphere
for business initiative, a more realistic exchange rate, a moderate
inflation rate, and the continued support of international
organizations. Serious underlying economic problems will continue.
Electric power has been in short supply and constitutes a major
barrier to future gains in national output. The government must
persist in efforts to manage its sizable external debt and extend its
privatization program.

@Haiti:Economy

Economy-overview: About 75% of the population lives in abject poverty.
Nearly 70% of all Haitians depend on the agriculture sector, which
consists mainly of small-scale subsistence farming and employs about
two-thirds of the economically active work force. The country has
experienced little or no job creation since President PREVAL took
office in February 1996, although the informal economy is growing.
Failure to reach agreements with international sponsors have denied
Haiti badly needed budget and development assistance. Meeting aid
conditions in 1998 will be especially challenging in the face of
mounting popular criticism of reforms.

@Honduras:Economy

Economy-overview: In 1994 the REINA administration inherited an
economy in the grips of stagflation due to an unprecedented energy
crisis, declining agricultural output, and extravagant public
expenditures. In response the REINA administration cut the fiscal
deficit and enacted a number of structural reforms including passage
of a modern financial sector reform law in 1995 and a central bank
reform law in 1996. As a result, Honduras finished 1997 with improved
GDP growth and a decreasing rate of inflation. The newly elected
FLORES administration faces pressure from the international financial
community and the IMF to further decrease the fiscal deficit and
implement key reforms, including the privatization of state
enterprises such as Hondutel. Tegucigalpa will probably implement
tighter fiscal and monetary policies to keep inflation low and meet
commitments to the IMF. This may slow GDP growth to 3.5% in 1998.
Moreover, wage increases for public-sector employees, agreed to in
1997, will make it difficult for FLORES to make headway on the fiscal
deficit and inflation.

@Hong Kong:Economy

Economy-overview: Hong Kong has a bustling free market economy highly
dependent on international trade. Natural resources are limited, and
food and raw materials must be imported. Indeed, imports and exports,
including reexports, each exceed GDP in dollar value. Real GDP growth
averaged a remarkable 8% in 1987-88, slowed to 3.0% in 1989-90, and
picked up to 4.2% in 1991, 5.0% in 1992, 5.2% in 1993, 5.5% in 1994,
4.8% in 1995, 4.7% in 1996, and an estimated 5.5% in 1997. A shortage
of labor continues to put upward pressure on prices and the cost of
living. Even before Hong Kong reverted to Chinese administration on 1
July 1997 it had extensive trade and investment ties with China.

@Hungary:Economy

Economy-overview: Hungary has consolidated its March 1995
stabilization program and undergone enough restructuring to become an
established market economy. The country appears to have entered a
period of sustainable growth, gradually falling inflation, and stable
external balances. The government's main economic priorities are to
complete structural reforms, particularly the implementation of the
1997 pension reform act (the first in the region), taxation reform,
and planning for comprehensive health care, local government finance
reform, and the reform of education at all levels. Foreign investment
has totaled more than $17 billion through 1997. In recognition of
Hungary's improved macro-economic situation, all major credit-rating
agencies listed the country's foreign currency debt issuances as
investment grade in 1996. The current IMF stand-by arrangement expired
in February 1998, and Budapest and the IMF agree that there is no need
to renew it. The OECD welcomed Hungary as a member in May 1996, and in
December 1997 the EU invited Hungary to begin the accession process.

@Iceland:Economy

Economy-overview: Iceland's Scandinavian-type economy is basically
capitalistic, yet with an extensive welfare system, low unemployment,
and remarkably even distribution of income. The economy depends
heavily on the fishing industry, which provides 75% of export earnings
and employs 12% of the work force. In the absence of other natural
resources-except energy-Iceland's economy is vulnerable to changing
world fish prices. The economy remains sensitive to declining fish
stocks as well as to drops in world prices for its main exports: fish
and fish products, aluminum, and ferrosilicon. The center-right
government plans to continue its policies of reducing the budget and
current account deficits, limiting foreign borrowing, containing
inflation, revising agricultural and fishing policies, diversifying
the economy, and privatizing state-owned industries. The government
remains opposed to EU membership, primarily because of Icelanders'
concern about losing control over their fishing resources. Growth is
likely to slow in 1998, to a still respectable 3.9%.

@India:Economy

Economy-overview: India's economy encompasses traditional village
farming, modern agriculture, handicrafts, a wide range of modern
industries, and a multitude of support services. 67% of India's labor
force of nearly 400 million work in agriculture, which contributes 30%
of the country's GDP. Production, trade, and investment reforms since
1991 have provided new opportunities for Indian businesspersons and an
estimated 300 million middle class consumers. New Delhi has avoided
debt rescheduling, attracted foreign investment, and revived
confidence in India's economic prospects since 1991. Many of the
country's fundamentals - including savings rates (26% of GDP) and
reserves (now about $24 billion) - are healthy. Inflation eased to 7%
in 1997, and interest rates dropped to between 10% and 13%. Even so,
the Indian Government needs to restore the early momentum of reform,
especially by continuing reductions in the extensive remaining
government regulations. Moreover, economic policy changes have not yet
significantly increased jobs or reduced the risk that international
financial strains will reemerge within the next few years. Nearly 40%
of the Indian population remains too poor to afford an adequate diet.
India's exports, currency, and foreign institutional investment were
affected by the East Asian crisis in late 1997 and early 1998, but
capital account controls, a low ratio of short-term debt to reserves,
and enhanced supervision of the financial sector helped insulate it
from near term balance-of-payments problems. Export growth, has been
slipping in 1996-97, averaging only about 4% to 5%-a large drop from
the more than 20% increases it was experiencing over the prior three
years-mainly because of the fall in Asian currencies relative to the
rupee. Energy, telecommunications, and transportation shortages and
the legacy of inefficient factories constrain industrial growth which
expanded only 6.7% in 1997-down from more than 11% in 1996. Growth of
the agricultural sector is still fairly slow rebounding to only 5.7%
in 1997 from a fall of 0.1% in 1996. Agricultural investment has
slowed, while costly subsidies on fertilizer, food distribution, and
rural electricity remain. Nevertheless, even if a series of weak
coalition governments continue to rule in New Delhi over the next few
years and are unable to push reforms aggressively, parts of the
economy that have already benefited from deregulation will continue to
grow. Indian think tanks project GDP growth of at least 5.5% in 1998.

@Indian Ocean:Economy

Economy-overview: The Indian Ocean provides major sea routes
connecting the Middle East, Africa, and East Asia with Europe and the
Americas. It carries a particularly heavy traffic of petroleum and
petroleum products from the oilfields of the Persian Gulf and
Indonesia. Its fish are of great and growing importance to the
bordering countries for domestic consumption and export. Fishing
fleets from Russia, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan also exploit the Indian
Ocean, mainly for shrimp and tuna. Large reserves of hydrocarbons are
being tapped in the offshore areas of Saudi Arabia, Iran, India, and
western Australia. An estimated 40% of the world's offshore oil
production comes from the Indian Ocean. Beach sands rich in heavy
minerals and offshore placer deposits are actively exploited by
bordering countries, particularly India, South Africa, Indonesia, Sri
Lanka, and Thailand.

@Indonesia:Economy

Economy-overview: While Indonesia was long touted for its sound
macroeconomic management and spectacular growth, the Asian financial
crisis in 1997/98 revealed the weak underpinnings of the economy: an
unhealthy banking sector, untenable levels of private foreign debt,
and uncompetitive practices that favored the financial interests of
former President SOEHARTO's family and friends. Indonesia sought IMF
assistance early in the crisis and eventually brokered a $42 billion
bailout package; but Jakarta jeopardized the program by resisting
strict IMF reforms, partly in response to the rupiah's collapse, which
lost as much as 80% of its value at one point. Economic prospects look
bleak for 1998: the economy probably will shrink between 4% to 10%,
unemployment top historic highs-in excess of 15%-and inflation move
toward hyper levels.

@Iran:Economy

Economy-overview: Iran's economy is a mixture of central planning,
state ownership of oil and other large enterprises, village
agriculture, and small-scale private trading and service ventures.
Newly elected President KHATAMI has continued to follow the market
reform plans of former President RAFSANJANI and has indicated that he
will pursue diversification of Iran's oil-reliant economy. In the
early 1990s, Iran experienced a financial crisis and was forced to
reschedule $15 billion in debt. The strong oil market in 1996 helped
ease financial pressures on Iran and allowed for Tehran's timely debt
service payments. Iran's financial situation tightened in 1997 and
early 1998 because of lower oil prices. Iran may be forced to decrease
imports and slow debt repayments if the oil market worsens further.

@Iraq:Economy

Economy-overview: The Ba'thist regime engages in extensive central
planning and management of industrial production and foreign trade
while leaving some small-scale industry and services and most
agriculture to private enterprise. The economy has been dominated by
the oil sector, which has traditionally provided about 95% of foreign
exchange earnings. In the 1980s, financial problems caused by massive
expenditures in the eight-year war with Iran and damage to oil export
facilities by Iran led the government to implement austerity measures
and to borrow heavily and later reschedule foreign debt payments; Iraq
suffered economic losses of at least $100 billion from the war. After
the end of hostilities in 1988, oil exports gradually increased with
the construction of new pipelines and restoration of damaged
facilities. Agricultural development remained hampered by labor
shortages, salinization, and dislocations caused by previous land
reform and collectivization programs. The industrial sector, although
accorded high priority by the government, also was under financial
constraints. Iraq's seizure of Kuwait in August 1990, subsequent
international economic embargoes, and military action by an
international coalition beginning in January 1991 drastically changed
the economic picture. The UN-sponsored economic embargo has reduced
exports and imports and has contributed to the sharp rise in prices.
The Iraqi Government has been unwilling to abide by UN resolutions so
that the economic embargo could be removed. The government's policies
of supporting large military and internal security forces and of
allocating resources to key supporters of the regime have exacerbated
shortages. Industrial and transportation facilities, which suffered
severe damage, have been partially restored. At current prices, oil
exports are about one-third of their prewar level because of the
implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 986-the UN's
oil-for-goods program-in December 1996. Shortages of spare parts
continue. In accord with the oil-for-goods deal, Iraq is allowed to
export $2 billion worth of oil in exchange for badly needed food and
medicine. The first oil was pumped in December 1996, and the first
supplies of food and medicine arrived in April 1997. Per capita output
for 1995-97 and living standards are well below the 1989-90 level, but
any estimates have a wide range of error.

@Ireland:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy is small and trade dependent.
Agriculture, once the most important sector, is now dwarfed by
industry, which accounts for 38% of GDP, about 80% of exports, and
employs 27% of the labor force. Although exports remain the primary
engine for Ireland's robust growth, the economy is also benefiting
from a rise in consumer spending and recovery in both construction and
business investment. Since the 1980s, inflation has fallen sharply and
chronic trade deficits have been transformed into annual surpluses.
Unemployment remains a serious problem, however, and job creation is
the main focus of government policy. To ease unemployment, Dublin
aggressively courts foreign investors and recently created a new
industrial development agency to aid small indigenous firms.

Central, Haifa, Jerusalem, Northern, Southern, Tel Aviv

Independence: 14 May 1948 (from League of Nations mandate under

independence on 14 May 1948, but the Jewish calendar is lunar and the
holiday may occur in April or May)

Constitution: no formal constitution; some of the functions of a
constitution are filled by the Declaration of Establishment (1948),
the basic laws of the parliament (Knesset), and the Israeli
citizenship law

regulations, and, in personal matters, Jewish, Christian, and Muslim
legal systems; in December 1985, Israel informed the UN Secretariat
that it would no longer accept compulsory ICJ jurisdiction

casts two ballots-one for the direct election of the prime minister
and one for the party in the Knesset; the candidate that receives the
largest percentage of the popular vote then works to form a coalition
with other parties to achieve a parliamentary majority of 61 seats;
finally, the candidate must submit his or her cabinet to the Knesset
for approval and this must be done within 45 days of the election; in
contrast to the old system, under the new law, the prime minister's
party need not be the single-largest party in the Knesset

@Israel:Economy

Economy-overview: Israel has a technologically advanced market economy
with substantial government participation. It depends on imports of
crude oil, grains, raw materials, and military equipment. Despite
limited natural resources, Israel has intensively developed its
agricultural and industrial sectors over the past 20 years.
Manufacturing and construction employ about 28% of Israeli workers;
agriculture, forestry, and fishing only 2.6%; and services the rest.
Israel is largely self-sufficient in food production except for
grains. Diamonds, high-technology equipment, and agricultural products
(fruits and vegetables) are leading exports. Israel usually posts
sizable current account deficits, which are covered by large transfer
payments from abroad and by foreign loans. Roughly half of the
government's external debt is owed to the US, which is its major
source of economic and military aid. To earn needed foreign exchange,
Israel has been targeting high-technology niches in international
markets, such as medical scanning equipment. The influx of Jewish
immigrants from the former USSR topped 750,000 during the period
1989-97, bringing the population of Israel from the former Soviet
Union to one million, or one-sixth of the total population. Initially
this great influx increased unemployment, intensified housing
problems, and strained the government budget. At the same time, the
immigrants bring to the economy scientific and professional expertise
of substantial value for the future.

@Italy:Economy

Economy-overview: Since World War II, the Italian economy has changed
from one based on agriculture into a ranking industrial economy, with
approximately the same total and per capita output as France and the
UK. This basically capitalistic economy is still divided into a
developed industrial north, dominated by private companies, and a less
developed agricultural south, with large public enterprises and more
than 20% unemployment. Most raw materials needed by industry and over
75% of energy requirements must be imported. In the second half of
1992, Rome became unsettled by the prospect of not qualifying to
participate in EU plans for economic and monetary union later in the
decade; thus, it finally began to address its huge fiscal imbalances.
Subsequently, the government has adopted fairly stringent budgets,
abandoned its inflationary wage indexation system, and started to
scale back its generous social welfare programs, including pension and
health care benefits. In November 1996 the lire rejoined the European
monetary system, which it had left in September 1992 when under
extreme pressure in currency markets. Italy faces the problem of
restructuring its economy to meet Maastricht criteria for inclusion in
the EMU, together with other problems of refurbishing a tottering
communications system, curbing industrial pollution, and adjusting to
new EU and global competitive forces.

@Jamaica:Economy

Economy-overview: Key sectors in this island economy are bauxite
(alumina and bauxite account for more than half of exports) and
tourism. Since assuming office in 1992, Prime Minister PATTERSON has
eliminated most price controls, streamlined tax schedules, and
privatized government enterprises. Continued tight monetary and fiscal
policies have helped slow inflation and stabilize the exchange rate,
but have resulted in the slow-down of economic growth (moving from
1.5% in 1992 to 0.5% in 1995. In 1996, GDP was in negative growth
(-1.4%) and remained so in 1997. Serious problems include: high
interest rates; increased foreign competition; the weak financial
condition of business in general resulting in receiverships or
closures and downsizings of companies; the shift in investment
portfolios to non-productive, short-term high yield instruments; a
pressured, sometimes sliding, exchange rate; a widening merchandise
trade deficit; and a growing internal debt for government bailouts to
various ailing sectors of the economy. Jamaica's medium-term prospects
will depend upon encouraging investment in the productive sectors,
maintaining a competitive exchange rate, stabilizing the labor
environment, and implementing proper fiscal and monetary policies.

@Japan:Economy

Economy-overview: Government-industry cooperation, a strong work
ethic, mastery of high technology, and a comparatively small defense
allocation (roughly 1% of GDP) have helped Japan advance with
extraordinary rapidity to the rank of second most powerful economy in
the world. One notable characteristic of the economy is the working
together of manufacturers, suppliers, and distributors in closely knit
groups called keiretsu. A second basic feature has been the guarantee
of lifetime employment for a substantial portion of the urban labor
force; this guarantee is eroding. Industry, the most important sector
of the economy, is heavily dependent on imported raw materials and
fuels. The much smaller agricultural sector is highly subsidized and
protected, with crop yields among the highest in the world. Usually
self-sufficient in rice, Japan must import about 50% of its
requirements of other grain and fodder crops. Japan maintains one of
the world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the
global catch. For three decades overall real economic growth had been
spectacular: a 10% average in the 1960s, a 5% average in the 1970s,
and a 4% average in the 1980s. Growth slowed markedly in 1992-95
largely because of the aftereffects of overinvestment during the late
1980s and contractionary domestic policies intended to wring
speculative excesses from the stock and real estate markets. Growth
picked up to 3.9% in 1996, largely a reflection of stimulative fiscal
and monetary policies as well as low rates of inflation. But in 1997
growth fell back to 1%. As a result of the expansionary fiscal
policies and declining tax revenues due to the recession, Japan has
one of the largest budget deficits as a percent of GDP among the
industrialized countries. The crowding of habitable land area and the
aging of the population are two other major long-run problems.

@Jersey:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy is based largely on financial services,
agriculture, and tourism. Potatoes, cauliflower, tomatoes, and
especially flowers are important export crops, shipped mostly to the
UK. The Jersey breed of dairy cattle is known worldwide and represents
an important export earner. Milk products go to the UK and other EU
countries. In 1986 the finance sector overtook tourism as the main
contributor to GDP, accounting for 40% of the island's output. In
recent years, the government has encouraged light industry to locate
in Jersey, with the result that an electronics industry has developed
alongside the traditional manufacturing of knitwear. All raw material
and energy requirements are imported, as well as a large share of
Jersey's food needs. Light tax and death duties make the island a
popular tax haven.

@Jordan:Economy

Economy-overview: Jordan is a small Arab country with inadequate
supplies of water and other natural resources such as oil and coal.
Jordan benefited from increased Arab aid during the oil boom of the
late 1970s and early 1980s, when its annual real GNP growth averaged
more than 10%. In the remainder of the 1980s, however, reductions in
both Arab aid and worker remittances slowed real economic growth to an
average of roughly 2% per year. Imports-mainly oil, capital goods,
consumer durables, and food-outstripped exports, with the difference
covered by aid, remittances, and borrowing. In mid-1989, the Jordanian
Government began debt-rescheduling negotiations and agreed to
implement an IMF-supported program designed to gradually reduce the
budget deficit and implement badly needed structural reforms. The
Persian Gulf crisis that began in August 1990, however, aggravated
Jordan's already serious economic problems, forcing the government to
shelve the IMF program, stop most debt payments, and suspend
rescheduling negotiations. Aid from Gulf Arab states, worker
remittances, and trade contracted; and refugees flooded the country,
producing serious balance-of-payments problems, stunting GDP growth,
and straining government resources. The economy rebounded in 1992,
largely due to the influx of capital repatriated by workers returning
from the Gulf, but recovery was uneven in 1994-97. The government is
implementing the reform program adopted in 1992 and continues to
secure rescheduling and write-offs of its heavy foreign debt. Debt,
poverty, and unemployment remain Jordan's biggest on-going problems.

@Kazakhstan:Economy

Economy-overview: Kazakhstan, the second largest of the former Soviet
republics in territory, possesses enormous untapped fossil fuel
reserves as well as plentiful supplies of other minerals and metals.
It also has considerable agricultural potential with its vast steppe
lands accommodating both livestock and grain production. Kazakhstan's
industrial sector rests on the extraction and processing of these
natural resources and also on a relatively large machine building
sector specializing in construction equipment, tractors, agricultural
machinery, and some defense items. The breakup of the USSR and the
collapse of demand for Kazakhstan's traditional heavy industry
products have resulted in a sharp contraction of the economy since
1991, with the steepest annual decline occurring in 1994. In 1995-97
the pace of the government program of economic reform and
privatization quickened, resulting in a substantial shifting of assets
into the private sector. The December 1996 signing of the Caspian
Pipeline Consortium agreement to build a new pipeline from western
Kazakhstan's Tengiz oil field to the Black Sea increases prospects for
substantially larger oil exports in several years. The emigration of
large numbers of skilled Slavic managers and technicians from the
northern industrial areas will hold back future growth.

@Kenya:Economy

Economy-overview: Since 1993, the government of Kenya has implemented
a program of economic liberalization and reform. Steps have included
the removal of import licensing and price controls, removal of foreign
exchange controls, fiscal and monetary restraint, and reduction of the
public sector through privatizing publicly owned companies and
downsizing the civil service. With the support of the World Bank, IMF,
and other donors, these reforms have led to a turnaround in economic
performance following a period of negative growth in the early 1990s.
Kenya's real GDP grew at 5% in 1995 and 4% in 1996, and inflation
remained under control. Growth slowed in 1997. Political violence
damaged the tourist industry, and the IMF allowed Kenya's Enhanced
Structural Adjustment Program to lapse due to the government's failure
to enact reform conditions and to adequately address public sector
corruption. Moreover, El Nino rains destroyed crops and damaged an
already crumbling infrastructure in 1997 and on into 1998. Long-term
barriers to development include electricity shortages, the
government's continued and inefficient dominance of key sectors,
endemic corruption, and the country's high population growth rate.

@Kiribati:Economy

Economy-overview: A remote country of 33 scattered coral atolls,
Kiribati has few national resources. Commercially viable phosphate
deposits were exhausted at the time of independence from the UK in
1979. Copra and fish now represent the bulk of production and exports.
The economy has fluctuated widely in recent years. Real GDP growth has
declined from about 10% in 1988 to about 2.6% in 1995 and 1.9% in
1996. Growth in 1997 was expected to parallel the 1996 performance.
Economic development is constrained by a shortage of skilled workers,
weak infrastructure, and remoteness from international markets. The
financial sector is at an early stage of development as is the
expansion of private sector initiatives. Foreign financial aid,
largely from the UK and Japan, is a critical supplement to GDP, equal
in amount to 25%-50% of GDP in recent years. Remittances from workers
abroad account for more than $5 million each year.

@Korea, North:Economy

Economy-overview: More than 90% of this command economy is socialized;
agricultural land is collectivized; and state-owned industry produces
95% of manufactured goods. State control of economic affairs is
unusually tight even for a communist country because of the small size
and homogeneity of the society and the strict rule of KIM Il-song in
the past and now his son, KIM Chong-il. Economic growth during the
period 1984-88 averaged 2%-3%, but output declined by an average of
4%-5% or more annually during 1989-97 because of systemic problems and
disruptions in economic and technological links with the former USSR
and China. The leadership has insisted on maintaining its high level
of military outlays from a shrinking economic pie. Moreover, a serious
drawdown in inventories and critical shortages in the energy sector
have led to increasing interruptions in industrial production.
Abundant mineral resources and hydropower have formed the basis of
industrial development since World War II. Manufacturing is centered
on heavy industry, including military industry, with light industry
lagging far behind. Despite the use of improved seed varieties,
expansion of irrigation, and the heavy use of fertilizers, North Korea
is not yet self-sufficient in food production. Indeed, a shortage of
arable lands, several years of poor harvests, systemic inefficiencies,
a cumbersome distribution system, and extensive floods in 1995-96
followed by a severe drought in 1997 have resulted in increasingly
serious food shortages. Substantial grain shipments from Japan and
South Korea are offsetting a portion of the losses. North Korea
remains far behind South Korea in economic development and living
standards.

@Korea, South:Economy

Economy-overview: As one of the Four Dragons of East Asia, South Korea
has achieved an incredible record of growth. Three decades ago its GDP
per capita was comparable with levels in the poorer countries of
Africa and Asia. Today its GDP per capita is eight times India's, 15
times North Korea's, and already up with the lesser economies of the
European Union. This success through the late 1980s was achieved by a
system of close government business ties, including directed credit,
import restrictions, sponsorship of specific industries, and a strong
labor effort. The government promoted the import of raw materials and
technology at the expense of consumer goods and encouraged savings and
investment over consumption. The Asian financial crisis of 1997/98
exposed certain longstanding weaknesses in South Korea's development
model, including high debt/equity ratios, massive foreign borrowing,
and an undisciplined financial sector. Also, a number of private
sector conglomerates are near bankruptcy. At yearend 1997, an
international effort, spearheaded by the IMF, was underway to shore up
reserves and stabilize the economy. Growth in 1998 will be sharply
cut. Long-term growth will depend on how successfully South Korea
implements planned economic reforms that would bolster the financial
sector, improve corporate management, and open the economy further to
foreign participation.

@Kuwait:Economy

Economy-overview: Kuwait is a small and relatively open economy with
proved crude oil reserves of about 94 billion barrels-10% of world
reserves. Kuwait has rebuilt its war-ravaged petroleum sector; its
crude oil production averaged 2 million barrels per day in 1996.
Petroleum accounts for nearly half of GDP, 90% of export revenues, and
75% of government income. Kuwait lacks water and has practically no
arable land, thus preventing development of agriculture. With the
exception of fish, it depends almost wholly on food imports. About 75%
of potable water must be distilled or imported. Because of its high
per capita income, Kuwait provides its citizens with extensive health,
educational, and retirement benefits. The bulk of the work force is
non-Kuwaiti, living at a considerably lower level. Per capita military
expenditures are among the highest in the world. The economy improved
moderately in 1994-97, with the growth in industry and finance. The
World Bank has urged Kuwait to push ahead with privatization,
including in the oil industry, but the government will move slowly on
opening the petroleum sector.

@Kyrgyzstan:Economy

Economy-overview: Kyrgyzstan is a small, poor, mountainous country
with a predominantly agricultural economy. Cotton, wool, and meat are
the main agricultural products and exports. Industrial exports include
gold, mercury, uranium, and hydropower. Kyrgyzstan has been one of the
most progressive countries of the former Soviet Union in carrying out
market reforms. Following a successful stabilization program, which
lowered inflation from 88% in 1994 to 15% for 1997, attention is
turning toward stimulating growth. Much of the government's stock in
enterprises has been sold. Drops in production have been severe since
the breakup of the Soviet Union in December 1991, but by mid-1995
production began to recover and exports began to increase. Pensioners,
unemployed workers, and government workers with salary arrears
continue to suffer. Foreign assistance played a substantial role in
the country's economic turnaround in 1996-97.

@Laos:Economy

Economy-overview: The government of Laos-one of the few remaining
official communist states-has been decentralizing control and
encouraging private enterprise since 1986. The results, starting from
an extremely low base, have been striking - growth averaged 7% in
1988-96. Because Laos depends heavily on its trade with Thailand, it
fell victim to the financial crisis in the region in 1997, when growth
was a mere 1.5%. Laos is a landlocked country with a primitive
infrastructure. It has no railroads, a rudimentary road system, and
limited external and internal telecommunications. Electricity is
available in only a few urban areas. Subsistence agriculture accounts
for half of GDP and provides 80% of total employment. The predominant
crop is glutinous rice. In non-drought years, Laos is self-sufficient
overall in food, but each year flood, pests, and localized drought
cause shortages in various parts of the country. For the foreseeable
future the economy will continue to depend on aid from the IMF and
other international sources; Japan is currently the largest bilateral
aid donor; aid from the former USSR/Eastern Europe has been cut
sharply. As in many developing countries, deforestation and soil
erosion will hamper efforts to regain a high rate of GDP growth.

@Latvia:Economy

Economy-overview: In 1997 Latvia scored the most impressive economic
achievements since independence in 1991, with GDP growing by 6% and
inflation at 7.4%. GDP is expected to grow 5% in 1998 and inflation to
range between 6% and 7%. In 1997 Latvia continued its strict fiscal
policy and apparently ended the year with a small fiscal surplus,
reflecting higher-than-expected income from customs revenues, excise
and business taxes, and restraints on government spending. Foreign
direct investment (FDI) in 1997 was a record $880 million by yearend.
Prospects for increasing FDI in 1998 are good if Latvia privatizes at
least some of its large companies, including Venspils Nafta (the state
oil company). Although Latvia was disappointed that it was not
included among the five Central and East European states invited to
start EU accession talks in spring 1998, it is likely to join the WTrO
in 1998. Latvia's growing current account and trade deficits remain a
cause for concern, reaching nearly 10% by yearend. Latvia's trade
deficit may even reach 22% of GDP in 1998.

LEBANON

Introduction

Current issues: Lebanon has made progress toward rebuilding its
political institutions and regaining its national sovereignty since
the end of the devastating 16-year civil war, which began in 1975.
Under the Ta'if Accord-the blueprint for national reconciliation-the
Lebanese have established a more equitable political system,
particularly by giving Muslims a greater say in the political process
while institutionalizing sectarian divisions in the government. Since
the end of the civil war, the Lebanese have formed five cabinets and
conducted two legislative elections. Most of the militias have been
weakened or disbanded. The Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) has seized vast
quantities of weapons used by the militias during the war and extended
central government authority over about one-half of the country.
Hizballah, the radical Shi'a party, retains most of its weapons.
Foreign forces still occupy areas of Lebanon. Israel maintains troops
in southern Lebanon and continues to support a proxy militia, the Army
of South Lebanon (ASL), along a narrow stretch of territory contiguous
to its border. The ASL's enclave encompasses this self-declared
security zone and about 20 kilometers north to the strategic town of
Jazzin. Syria maintains about 25,000 troops in Lebanon. These troops
are based mainly in Beirut, North Lebanon, and the Bekaa Valley.
Syria's deployment was legitimized by the Arab League during Lebanon's
civil war and in the Ta'if accord. Citing the continued weakness of
the LAF, Beirut's requests, and failure of the Lebanese Government to
implement all of the constitutional reforms in the Ta'if accord,
Damascus has so far refused to withdraw its troops from Lebanon.

@Lebanon:Economy

Economy-overview: The 1975-91 civil war seriously damaged Lebanon's
economic infrastructure, cut national output by half, and all but
ended Lebanon's position as a Middle Eastern entrepot and banking hub.
Peace has enabled the central government to restore control in Beirut,
begin collecting taxes, and regain access to key port and government
facilities. Economic recovery has been helped by a financially sound
banking system and resilient small- and medium-scale manufacturers,
with family remittances, banking services, manufactured and farm
exports, and international aid as the main sources of foreign
exchange. Lebanon's economy has made impressive gains since Prime
Minister HARIRI launched his $18 billion "Horizon 2000" reconstruction
program in 1993. Real GDP grew 8% in 1994 and 7% in 1995 before
Israel's Operation Grapes of Wrath in April 1996 stunted economic
activity. During 1992-97, annual inflation fell from more than 170% to
9%, and foreign exchange reserves jumped to more than $4 billion from
$1.4 billion. Burgeoning capital inflows have generated foreign
payments surpluses, and the Lebanese pound has remained relatively
stable. Progress also has been made in rebuilding Lebanon's war-torn
physical and financial infrastructure. Solidere, a $2-billion firm, is
managing the reconstruction of Beirut's central business district; the
stock market reopened in January 1996; and international banks and
insurance companies are returning. The government nonetheless faces
serious challenges in the economic arena. It has had to fund
reconstruction by tapping foreign exchange reserves and boosting
borrowing. The stalled peace process and ongoing violence in southern
Lebanon could lead to wider hostilities that would disrupt vital
capital inflows. Furthermore, the gap between rich and poor has
widened since HARIRI took office, resulting in grassroots
dissatisfaction over the skewed distribution of the reconstruction's
benefits and leading the government to shift its focus from rebuilding
infrastructure to improving living conditions.

@Lesotho:Economy

Economy-overview: Small, landlocked, and mountainous, Lesotho has no
important natural resources other than water. Its economy is based on
agriculture, light manufacturing, and remittances from miners employed
in South Africa. The number of such mine workers has declined steadily
over the past five years; in 1996 their remittances added about 33% to
GDP compared with the addition of roughly 67% in 1990. Manufacturing
depends largely on farm products which support the milling, canning,
leather, and jute industries. Recent foreign investments will enable
Lesotho to export garments made from imported textiles. Although
drought has decreased agricultural activity over the past few years,
completion of a major hydropower facility in January 1998 now permits
the sale of water to South Africa and will support the economy's
continued expansion. The pace of the privatization of state-owned
firms increased toward the end of 1994.

LIBERIA

Introduction

Current issues: The Abuja Peace Accords ended seven years of civil
warfare in Liberia. More than 20,000 of the estimated 33,000 factional
fighters gave up their arms to the Cease-Fire Monitoring Group of the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOMOG). Free and open
presidential and legislative elections were held 19 July 1997; former
faction leader, Charles TAYLOR, and his National Patriotic Party won
overwhelming victories. The years of civil strife coupled with the
flight of most business people disrupted formal economic activity, but
with peace restored and a popularly-elected government installed, the
difficult task of rebuilding the social and economic structure of this
war-torn country can proceed.

@Liberia:Economy

Economy-overview: Civil war since 1990 has destroyed much of Liberia's
economy, especially the infrastructure in and around Monrovia. Many
businessmen have fled the country, taking capital and expertise with
them. Some returned during 1997. Many will not return. Richly endowed
with water, mineral resources, forests, and a climate favorable to
agriculture, Liberia had been a producer and exporter of basic
products, while local manufacturing, mainly foreign owned, had been
small in scope. The democratically elected government, installed in
August 1997, inherited massive international debts and currently
relies on revenues from its maritime registry to provide the bulk of
its foreign exchange earnings. The restoration of the infrastructure
and the raising of incomes in this ravaged economy depends on
continued disarmament of factions and the implementation of sound
macro- and micro-economic policies of the new government.

@Libya:Economy

Economy-overview: The socialist-oriented economy depends primarily
upon revenues from the oil sector, which contributes practically all
export earnings and about one-third of GDP. Per capita GDP is the
highest in Africa at $6,700, but disproportionately little of national
income flows down to the lower orders of society. GDP growth
fluctuates sharply in response to changes in the world oil market; GDP
has either contracted or grown very sluggishly since 1992. Import
restrictions and inefficient resource allocations have led to periodic
shortages of basic goods and foodstuffs. The nonoil manufacturing and
construction sectors, which account for about 20% of GDP, have
expanded from processing mostly agricultural products to include the
production of petrochemicals, iron, steel, and aluminum. Although
agriculture accounts for only 5% of GDP, it employs 18% of the labor
force. Climatic conditions and poor soils severely limit farm output,
and Libya imports about 75% of its food requirements. The UN sanctions
imposed in April 1992 do not have a major impact on the economy
although they have increased transaction and transportation costs.

@Liechtenstein:Economy

Economy-overview: Despite its small size and limited natural
resources, Liechtenstein has developed into a prosperous, highly
industrialized, free-enterprise economy with a vital financial service
sector and living standards on a par with the urban areas of its large
European neighbors. Low business taxes-the maximum tax rate is 18%-and
easy incorporation rules have induced about 73,700 holding or
so-called letter box companies to establish nominal offices in
Liechtenstein, providing 30% of state revenues. The country
participates in a customs union with Switzerland and uses the Swiss
franc as its national currency. It imports more than 90% of its energy
requirements. Liechtenstein is a member of the European Economic Area
(an organization serving as a bridge between EFTA and EU) since May
1995. The government is working to harmonize its economic policies
with those of an integrated Europe.

@Lithuania:Economy

Economy-overview: Lithuania has benefited from its disciplined
approach to market reform and its adherence to strict fiscal and
monetary policies imposed by the IMF, measures that have helped
constrain the growth of the money supply, reduce inflation to 8.6%,
and support GDP growth of 6% in 1997. Inflation is expected to fall in
1998 to 6% and GDP to grow at close to 7%. Foreign direct investment
in 1997 of some $430 million pushed the country over the $1 billion
mark, the first Baltic state to reach this milestone. However, the
current account deficit has hovered around 8% to 10% of GDP annually
since 1995-the result of greater demand for consumer goods and falling
growth in exports.

@Luxembourg:Economy

Economy-overview: The stable, prosperous economy features moderate
growth, low inflation, and low unemployment. Agriculture is based on
small family-owned farms. The industrial sector, until recently
dominated by steel, has become increasingly more diversified. During
the past decades, growth in the financial sector has more than
compensated for the decline in steel. Services, especially banking,
account for a growing proportion of the economy. Luxembourg
participates in an economic union with Belgium on trade and most
financial matters, is also closely connected economically to the
Netherlands, and, as a member of the EU, enjoys the advantages of the
open European market.

@Macedonia, The Former Yugoslav Republic of:Economy

Economy-overview: The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, although
the poorest republic in the former Yugoslav federation, can meet basic
food and energy needs through its own agricultural and coal resources.
The economy slowly rebounded in 1996-97 after years of recession.
Continued recovery depends on Macedonia's ability to attract
investment, to redevelop trade ties with Greece and Serbia and
Montenegro, and to maintain its commitment to economic liberalization.
The economy depends on outside sources for all of its oil and gas and
most of its modern machinery and parts. An important supplement of GDP
is the remittances from thousands of Macedonians working in Germany
and other West European nations.

@Madagascar:Economy

Economy-overview: Madagascar suffers from chronic malnutrition,
underfunded health and education facilities, a roughly 3% annual
population growth rate, and severe loss of forest cover, accompanied
by erosion. Agriculture, including fishing and forestry, is the
mainstay of the economy, accounting for 33% of GDP and contributing
more than 70% to export earnings. Industry features textile
manufacturing and the processing of agricultural products. Growth in
output in 1992-97 averaged less than the growth rate of the
population. Growth has been held back by antigovernment strikes and
demonstrations, a decline in world coffee demand, and the erratic
commitment of the government to economic reform. Formidable obstacles
stand in the way of Madagascar's realizing its considerable growth
potential; the extent of government reforms, outside financial aid,
and foreign investment will be key determinants.

accounts for 45% of GDP and 90% of export revenues. The economy
depends on substantial inflows of economic assistance from the IMF,
the World Bank, and individual donor nations. The new government faces
strong challenges, e.g., to spur exports, to improve educational and
health facilities, and to deal with environmental problems of
deforestation and erosion.

@Malaysia:Economy

Economy-overview: After decades of high GDP growth, Malaysia's
economy-shaken by the ongoing regional financial crisis in 1997/98-is
forecast by the government to grow only 4%-5% in 1998; private
forecasts project the growth rate could be as low as 2%. The sharp
decline in local currency and stock markets forced Kuala Lumpur to
announce tough cost-cutting measures-on top of a contractionary
budget-to further reduce the current account deficit to 3% of GDP in
1998 from 5.5% in 1997. To achieve this goal, Kuala Lumpur will cut
government spending by 20% and continue to slash big-ticket imports
and defer large-scale infrastructure projects. Government austerity
and slower growth mean increased unemployment and higher interest
rates that will bite into corporate earnings.

@Maldives:Economy

Economy-overview: Tourism, Maldives largest industry, accounts for
about 18% of GDP and more than 60% of the Maldives' foreign exchange
receipts. Over 90% of government tax revenue comes from import duties
and tourism-related taxes. About 350,000 tourists visited the islands
in 1997. Fishing is a second leading growth sector. The Maldivian
Government began an economic reform program in 1989 initially by
lifting import quotas and opening some exports to the private sector.
Subsequently, it has liberalized regulations to allow more foreign
investment. Agriculture and manufacturing continue to play a minor
role in the economy, constrained by the limited availability of
cultivable land and the shortage of domestic labor. Most staple foods
must be imported. Industry, which consists mainly of garment
production, boat building, and handicrafts, accounts for about 15% of
GDP. Maldivian authorities worry about the impact of erosion and
possible global warming on their low-lying country; 80% of the area is
three feet or less above sea level.

@Mali:Economy

Economy-overview: Mali is among the poorest countries in the world,
with 65% of its land area desert or semidesert. Economic activity is
largely confined to the riverine area irrigated by the Niger. About
10% of the population is nomadic and some 80% of the labor force is
engaged in farming and fishing. Industrial activity is concentrated on
processing farm commodities. Mali is heavily dependent on foreign aid
and vulnerable to fluctuations in world prices for cotton, its main
export. In 1997, the government continued its successful
implementation of an IMF-recommended structural adjustment program
that is helping the economy grow, diversify, and attract foreign
investment. Mali's adherence to economic reform, and the 50%
devaluation of the African franc in January 1994, has pushed up
economic growth. Several multinational corporations increased gold
mining operations in 1996 and the government anticipates that Mali
will become a major Sub-Saharan gold exporter in the next few years.

@Malta:Economy

Economy-overview: Significant resources are limestone, a favorable
geographic location, and a productive labor force. Malta produces only
about 20% of its food needs, has limited freshwater supplies, and has
no domestic energy sources. The economy is dependent on foreign trade,
manufacturing (especially electronics and textiles), and tourism; the
state-owned Malta drydocks employs about 3,800 people. In 1996,
approximately 1 million tourists visited the island. Per capita GDP of
$12,900 places Malta in the range of the less affluent EU countries.
The island is divided politically over the question of joining the EU.

@Man, Isle of:Economy

Economy-overview: Offshore banking, manufacturing, and tourism are key
sectors of the economy. The government's policy of offering incentives
to high-technology companies and financial institutions to locate on
the island has paid off in expanding employment opportunities in
high-income industries. As a result, agriculture and fishing, once the
mainstays of the economy, have declined in their shares of GDP.
Banking and other services now contribute more than half to GDP. Trade
is mostly with the UK. The Isle of Man enjoys free access to EU
markets.

@Marshall Islands:Economy

Economy-overview: US Government assistance is the mainstay of the
economy, constituting an important supplement to GDP. Agricultural
production is concentrated on small farms, and the most important
commercial crops are coconuts, tomatoes, melons, and breadfruit.
Small-scale industry is limited to handicrafts, fish processing, and
copra. The tourist industry, now a small source of foreign exchange
employing less than 10% of the labor force, remains the best hope for
future added income. The islands have few natural resources, and
imports far exceed exports. The government is drafting economic
reforms designed to increase revenue and compensate for reductions in
US Government grants-in FY95/96, the US Government provided grants of
$68 million, equal to roughly 70% of the country's GDP. More than 25%
of the government's FY95/96 budget was devoted to debt repayment. In
1996, efforts to stabilize the economy included a 27% reduction in the
government's work force and a 10% cut in the budget.

@Martinique:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy is based on sugarcane, bananas, tourism,
and light industry. Agriculture accounts for about 6% of GDP and the
small industrial sector for 11%. Sugar production has declined, with
most of the sugarcane now used for the production of rum. Banana
exports are increasing, going mostly to France. The bulk of meat,
vegetable, and grain requirements must be imported, contributing to a
chronic trade deficit that requires large annual transfers of aid from
France. Tourism has become more important than agricultural exports as
a source of foreign exchange. The majority of the work force is
employed in the service sector and in administration.

@Mauritania:Economy

Economy-overview: A majority of the population still depends on
agriculture and livestock for a livelihood, even though most of the
nomads and many subsistence farmers were forced into the cities by
recurrent droughts in the 1970s and 1980s. Mauritania has extensive
deposits of iron ore, which account for almost 50% of total exports.
The decline in world demand for this ore, however, has led to cutbacks
in production. The nation's coastal waters are among the richest
fishing areas in the world, but overexploitation by foreigners
threatens this key source of revenue. The country's first deepwater
port opened near Nouakchott in 1986. In recent years, drought and
economic mismanagement have resulted in a substantial buildup of
foreign debt. The government has begun the second stage of an economic
reform program in consultation with the World Bank, the IMF, and major
donor countries. Short-term growth prospects are poor because of the
heavy debt service burden, rapid population growth, and vulnerability
to climatic conditions.

@Mauritius:Economy

Economy-overview: Since independence in 1968, Mauritius has developed
from a low income, agriculturally based economy to a middle income
diversified economy with growing industrial, financial services, and
tourist sectors. For most of the period, annual growth has been of the
order of 5% to 6%. This remarkable achievement has been reflected in
increased life expectancy, lowered infant mortality, and a much
improved infrastructure. Sugarcane is grown on about 90% of the
cultivated land area and accounts for 25% of export earnings. The
government's development strategy centers on industrialization (with a
view to modernization and to exports), agricultural diversification,
and tourism. Economic performance in 1991-97 continued strong with
solid growth and low unemployment.

Economy-overview: Economic activity is based primarily on the
agricultural sector, including fishing and livestock raising. Mayotte
is not self-sufficient and must import a large portion of its food
requirements, mainly from France. The economy and future development
of the island are heavily dependent on French financial assistance, an
important supplement to GDP. Mayotte's remote location is an obstacle
to the development of tourism.

@Mexico:Economy

Economy-overview: Mexico has a free market economy with a mixture of
modern and outmoded industry and agriculture, increasingly dominated
by the private sector. The number of state-owned enterprises in Mexico
has fallen from more than 1,000 in 1982 to fewer than 200 in 1998. The
ZEDILLO administration is privatizing and expanding competition in sea
ports, railroads, telecommunications, electricity, natural gas
distribution, and airports. The Mexican economy is in its third year
of recovery from the recession of 1995, which was touched off by a
financial crisis. After declining 6.2% in 1995, real GDP grew 5.1% in
1996 and 7.3% in 1997 and is expected to rise by 5% in 1998. A strong
export sector helped to cushion the economy's decline in 1995 and led
the recovery in 1996 and 1997. Private consumption spending in 1998
probably will rise by at least 4% on the strength of increased
employment and rising real wages, and the troubled banking sector is
likely to increase lending for the first time in three years. Despite
the spillover from the Asian crisis, the medium-term outlook for
Mexico remains positive, with government and private sector economists
projecting average annual growth of 4% to 5% through the year 2000.
Mexico still needs to overcome many structural problems as it strives
to modernize its economy and raise living standards. Income
distribution is very unequal with the top 20% of income earners
accounting for 55% of income. The inefficient agricultural sector
employs 20% to 25% of the labor force but produces only 8% of GDP.
Trade with the United States and Canada has nearly doubled since NAFTA
was implemented in 1994. Mexico is pursuing additional trade
agreements with most countries in Latin America and with the European
Union to lessen its dependence on the United States, which accounts
for 80% of Mexico's total trade.

@Micronesia, Federated States of:Economy

Economy-overview: Economic activity consists primarily of subsistence
farming and fishing. The islands have few mineral deposits worth
exploiting, except for high-grade phosphate. The potential for a
tourist industry exists, but the remoteness of the location and a lack
of adequate facilities hinder development. Financial assistance from
the US is the primary source of revenue, with the US pledged to spend
$1 billion in the islands in the 1990s. Geographical isolation and a
poorly developed infrastructure are major impediments to long-term
growth.

@Moldova:Economy

Economy-overview: Moldova enjoys a favorable climate and good farmland
but has no major mineral deposits. As a result, the economy depends
heavily on agriculture, featuring fruits, vegetables, wine, and
tobacco. Moldova must import all of its supplies of oil, coal, and
natural gas, largely from Russia. Energy shortages contributed to
sharp production declines after the breakup of the Soviet Union in
1991. The Moldovan Government has recently been making progress on an
ambitious economic reform agenda. As part of its reform efforts,
Moldova introduced a stable convertible currency, freed all prices,
stopped issuing preferential credits to state enterprises and backed
steady land privatization, removed export controls, and freed interest
rates. The IMF has suspended payment on Moldova's Extended Fund
Facility since November 1997, due to concerns about the budget deficit
and money supply growth. In late December Parliament agreed to a lower
1998 budget deficit to address IMF and World Bank concerns.

@Monaco:Economy

Economy-overview: Monaco, situated on the French Mediterranean coast,
is a popular resort, attracting tourists to its casino and pleasant
climate. The Principality has successfully sought to diversify into
services and small, high-value-added, nonpolluting industries. The
state has no income tax and low business taxes and thrives as a tax
haven both for individuals who have established residence and for
foreign companies that have set up businesses and offices. About 55%
of Monaco's annual revenue comes from value-added taxes on hotels,
banks, and the industrial sector. Living standards are high, roughly
comparable to those in prosperous French metropolitan areas.

@Mongolia:Economy

Economy-overview: The government has embraced free-market economics,
freezing spending, easing price controls, liberalizing domestic and
international trade. Mongolia's severe climate, scattered population,
and wide expanses of unproductive land, however, have constrained
economic development. Economic activity traditionally has been based
on agriculture and the breeding of livestock. In past years, extensive
mineral resources had been developed with Soviet support; total Soviet
assistance at its height amounted to 30% of GDP, but disappeared
almost overnight in 1990-91. The mining and processing of coal,
copper, molybdenum, tin, tungsten, and gold account for a large part
of industrial production. The Mongolian leadership has been soliciting
support from foreign donors, who pledged some $250 million in aid in
October 1997. Economic growth picked up in 1997 after stalling in 1996
due to a series of natural disasters and declines in world prices of
copper and cashmere.

@Montserrat:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy of this volcanic island is small and
open, with economic activity centered on tourism and related services.
Tourism accounts for roughly one-quarter of Montserrat's national
income. The island's main export is electronic components, which are
mainly shipped to the US. The agriculture sector is small; cabbages,
carrots, cucumbers, and onions are grown for the domestic market;
additionally, some hot peppers and live plants are exported to the US
and Europe. Volcanic activity in mid-1997 led to a substantial
evacuation of the southern half of the island, including the capital,
Plymouth. Volcanic activity since July 1995 has resulted in the
departure of an estimated 8,000 people, mainly to Antigua and
Guadeloupe.

@Morocco:Economy

Economy-overview: Morocco faces the problems typical of developing
countries-restraining government spending, reducing constraints on
private activity and foreign trade, and keeping inflation within
manageable bounds. Since the early 1980s the government has pursued an
economic program toward these objectives with the support of the IMF,
the World Bank, and the Paris Club of creditors. The dirham is now
fully convertible for current account transactions; reforms of the
financial sector have been implemented; and state enterprises are
slowly being privatized. Drought conditions in 1997 depressed activity
in the key agricultural sector, holding down exports and contributing
to a 2.2% contraction in real GDP. Favorable rainfalls in the fall of
1997 have led to forecasts of robust, 8%-9% real GDP growth in 1998.
Servicing the external debt, preparing the economy for freer trade
with the European Union, improving education and living standards, and
finding jobs for Morocco's youthful population remain long-term
challenges.

@Mozambique:Economy

Economy-overview: Before the peace accord of October 1992, Mozambique
had been devastated by civil war and was one of the poorest countries
on the globe. Prospects subsequently improved, and with its solid
economic performance in 1996-97, Mozambique has begun to exploit its
sizable agricultural, hydropower, and transportation resources.
Foreign assistance programs help supply the foreign exchange required
to support the budget and pay for imports of goods and services. The
restoration of electrical transmission lines to South Africa and the
completion of a new transmission line to Zimbabwe (permitting the
giant Cahora Bassa hydropower plant to export large amounts of
electricity), proposed construction of a natural gas pipeline to South
Africa, and reform of transportation services will greatly improve
foreign exchange receipts. The Mozambique and South African
Governments are developing the Maputo corridor, linking the port of
Maputo with Witbank, South Africa. In the past few years, more than
700 state enterprises have been privatized, including the country's
largest commercial bank and a number of sizable manufacturing firms.
Other pending reform measures are the reform of tax collection and the
facilitation of private enterprise in the transportation, energy, and
telecommunications sectors.

@Namibia:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy is heavily dependent on the extraction
and processing of minerals for export. Mining accounts for 20% of GDP.
Namibia is the fourth-largest exporter of nonfuel minerals in Africa
and the world's fifth-largest producer of uranium. Rich alluvial
diamond deposits make Namibia a primary source for gem-quality
diamonds. Namibia also produces large quantities of lead, zinc, tin,
silver, and tungsten. Half of the population depends on agriculture
(largely subsistence agriculture) for its livelihood. Namibia must
import some of its food. Although per capita GDP is three to six times
the per capita GDP of Africa's poorest countries, the majority of
Namibia's people live in pronounced poverty because of the great
inequality of income distribution and the large amounts going to
foreigners. The Namibian economy has close links to South Africa.

@Nauru:Economy

Economy-overview: Revenues come from the export of phosphates, the
reserves of which are expected to be exhausted by the year 2000.
Phosphates have given Nauruans one of the highest per capita incomes
in the Third World, but incomes probably will drop sharply in the
future. Few other resources exist, so most necessities must be
imported, including fresh water from Australia. The rehabilitation of
mined land and the replacement of income from phosphates are serious
long-term problems. Substantial amounts of phosphate income are
invested in trust funds to help cushion the transition. However,
dividends from the trusts have declined sharply since 1990 and the
government has been borrowing heavily from the trusts to finance
fiscal deficits. In an effort to stem further escalation of fiscal
problems, the government has called for a freeze on wages for two
years, a reduction of over-staffed public service departments, drastic
cutbacks in hiring new government staff, privatization of numerous
government agencies, and closure of some overseas consulates.

@Nepal:Economy

Economy-overview: Nepal is among the poorest and least developed
countries in the world with more than half of its population living
below the poverty line. Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy,
providing a livelihood for over 80% of the population and accounting
for 40% of GDP. Industrial activity mainly involves the processing of
agricultural produce including jute, sugarcane, tobacco, and grain.
Production of textiles and carpets has expanded recently and accounted
for about 80% of foreign exchange earnings in the past two years.
Apart from agricultural land and forests, exploitable natural
resources are mica, hydropower, and tourism. Agricultural production
is growing by about 5% on average as compared with annual population
growth of 2.5%. Since May 1991, the government has been moving forward
with economic reforms particularly those that encourage trade and
foreign investment, e.g., by eliminating business licenses and
registration requirements in order to simplify investment procedures.
The government has also been cutting expenditures by reducing
subsidies, privatizing state industries, and laying off civil
servants. More recently, however, political instability - five
different governments over the past few years-has hampered Kathmandu's
ability to forge consensus to implement key economic reforms. Nepal
has considerable scope for accelerating economic growth by exploiting
its potential in hydropower and tourism, areas where there has
recently been foreign investment interest. Prospects for foreign trade
or investment in other areas will remain poor, however, because of the
small size of the economy, its technological backwardness, its
remoteness, its landlocked geographic location, and its susceptibility
to natural disaster. The international community's role of funding
more than 60% of Nepal's development budget and more than 28% of total
budgetary expenditures will likely continue as a major ingredient of
growth.

@Netherlands:Economy

Economy-overview: This highly developed and affluent economy is based
on private enterprise. The government makes its presence felt,
however, through many regulations, permit requirements, and welfare
programs affecting most aspects of economic activity. Industrial
activity features food-processing, oil-refining, and metalworking. The
highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2% of the labor
force but provides large surpluses for export and the domestic
food-processing industry. Indeed, the Netherlands ranks third
worldwide in value of agricultural exports, behind the US and France.
Sharp cuts in subsidy and social security spending have been
accompanied by sustained growth in output and employment. Growth in
1998 should be a brisk 3.5%. The Dutch will almost certainly qualify
for the first wave of countries entering the European Monetary Union
(EMU) in 1999.

@New Caledonia:Economy

Economy-overview: New Caledonia has more than 20% of the world's known
nickel resources. In recent years, the economy has suffered because of
depressed international demand for nickel, the principal source of
export earnings. Only a negligible amount of the land is suitable for
cultivation, and food accounts for about 25% of imports. In addition
to nickel, financial support from France and tourism are key to the
health of the economy. The outlook for 1998 is clouded by the
spillover of financial problems in East Asia and by lower expected
prices for nickel.

@New Zealand:Economy

Economy-overview: Since 1984 the government has accomplished major
economic restructuring, moving an agrarian economy dependent on a
concessionary British market access toward a more industrialized, free
market economy that can compete globally. This dynamic growth has
boosted real incomes, broadened and deepened the technological
capabilities of the industrial sector, and contained inflationary
pressures. Business confidence strengthened in 1994, and export demand
picked up in the Asia-Pacific region, resulting in 6.2% growth. Growth
continued strong in 1995, but tailed off in 1996-97. Inflation remains
among the lowest in the industrial world. Per capita GDP has been
moving up to the levels of the big West European economies. However,
the Asian economic crisis may slow GDP growth in 1998.

@Nicaragua:Economy

Economy-overview: The Nicaraguan economy, devastated during the 1980s
by economic mismanagement and civil war, is beginning to rebound. In
1991 President CHAMORRO launched an ambitious economic stabilization
program that reduced inflation and obtained substantial economic aid
from abroad. Economic growth rose sharply in 1995-97, due to surges in
exports and efforts to enhance trade liberalization. The program,
however, hit some snags, and a 1994-97 IMF Enhanced Structural
Adjustment Facility (ESAF) signed by the CHAMORRO administration with
the Fund lapsed in September 1996 due to non-compliance. In 1997,
however, the IMF resumed negotiations for an ESAF with the ALEMAN
administration, and agreed to an ESAF in 1998. IMF approval of the
ESAF cleared the way for debt relief by the Paris Club later that year
and has opened the way for debt relief under the Highly Indebted Poor
Countries Initiative. Implementation of a 1997 property
accord-designed to resolve conflict over properties confiscated by the
Sandinistas in the 1980s-should also help inspire international
investor confidence. Strong growth is forecast for 1998, with
implementation of a 1997 free trade agreement with Mexico expected to
boost agricultural exports, although the industrial sector may come
under pressure from increased Mexican competition.

@Niger:Economy

Economy-overview: Niger is a poor, landlocked Sub-Saharan nation,
whose economy centers on subsistence agriculture, animal husbandry,
reexport trade, and increasingly less on uranium, its major export
since the 1970s. Terms of trade with Nigeria, Niger's largest regional
trade partner, have improved dramatically since the 50% devaluation of
the West African franc in January 1994; this devaluation boosted
exports of livestock, cowpeas, onions, and the products of Niger's
small cotton industry. The government relies on bilateral and
multilateral aid for operating expenses and public investment and is
strongly induced to adhere to structural adjustment programs designed
by the IMF and the World Bank. The US terminated bilateral assistance
to Niger after the coup of 1996. Other donors have reduced their aid.

@Nigeria:Economy

Economy-overview: The oil-rich Nigerian economy continues to be
hobbled by political instability, corruption, and poor macroeconomic
management. Nigeria's unpopular military rulers have failed to make
significant progress in diversifying the economy away from
overdependence on the capital intensive oil sector which provides 30%
of GDP, 95% of foreign exchange earnings, and about 80% of budgetary
revenues. The government's resistance to initiating greater
transparency and accountability in managing the country's multibillion
dollar oil earnings continues to limit economic growth and prevent an
agreement with the IMF and bilateral creditors on debt relief. The
largely subsistence agricultural sector has failed to keep up with
rapid population growth, and Nigeria, once a large net exporter of
food, now must import food. Agricultural production in 1996 suffered
from severe shortages of fertilizer, and production of fertilizer fell
even further in 1997.

@Niue:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy is heavily dependent on aid from New
Zealand and remittances as Niue has no indigenous export product.
Government expenditures regularly exceed revenues, with the shortfall
made up by grants from New Zealand; the grants are used to pay wages
to public employees. Niue cut government expenditures in 1994-96 by
reducing the public service by almost half. The agricultural sector
consists mainly of subsistence gardening, although some cash crops are
grown for export. Industry consists primarily of small factories to
process passion fruit, lime oil, honey, and coconut cream. The sale of
postage stamps to foreign collectors is an important source of
revenue. The island in recent years has suffered a serious loss of
population because of migration of Niueans to New Zealand. A small
tourist industry is developing.

@Northern Mariana Islands:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy benefits substantially from financial
assistance from the US. The rate of funding has declined as locally
generated government revenues have grown. An agreement for the years
1986 to 1992 entitled the islands to $228 million for capital
development, government operations, and special programs. Since 1992,
funding has been extended one year at a time. The commonwealth
received $27.7 million from FY93/94 through FY95/96. For FY96/97
through FY02/03, funding of $11 million will be provided for
infrastructure, with an equal local match. A rapidly growing chief
source of income is the tourist industry, which now employs about 50%
of the work force. Japanese tourists predominate. The agricultural
sector is of minor importance and is made up of cattle ranches and
small farms producing coconuts, breadfruit, tomatoes, and melons.
Garment production is the fastest growing industry with employment of
12,000 mostly Chinese workers and shipments of $800 million to the US
in 1997 under duty and quota exemptions.

@Norway:Economy

Economy-overview: Norway is a prosperous bastion of welfare
capitalism. The economy consists of a combination of free market
activity and government intervention. The government controls key
areas, such as the vital petroleum sector (through large-scale state
enterprises), and extensively subsidizes agriculture, fishing, and
areas with sparse resources. Norway maintains an extensive welfare
system that helps propel public sector expenditures to more than 50%
of GDP and results in one of the highest average tax levels in the
world. A small country with a high dependence on international trade,
Norway is basically an exporter of raw materials and semiprocessed
goods, with an abundance of small- and medium-sized firms, and is
ranked among the major shipping nations. The country is richly endowed
with natural resources-petroleum, hydropower, fish, forests, and
minerals-and is highly dependent on its oil sector. Only Saudi Arabia
exports more oil than Norway. Norway imports more than half its food
needs. Oslo opted to stay out of the EU during a referendum in
November 1994. Economic growth in 1998 should be about the same as in
1997. Inflation probably will move up toward 3% because of tightness
in labor markets. Despite their high per capita income-outstripped
among major nations only by the US-and their generous welfare
benefits, Norwegians worry about that time in the 21st century when
the oil and gas run out.

@Oman:Economy

Economy-overview: Economic performance is closely tied to the fortunes
of the oil industry. Petroleum accounts for 75% of export earnings and
government revenues and for roughly 40% of GDP. Oman has proved oil
reserves of 4 billion barrels, equivalent to about 20 years'
production at the current rate of extraction. Agriculture is carried
on at a subsistence level and the general population depends on
imported food. The year 1996 was marked by higher oil production and
prices. The government is encouraging private investment, both
domestic and foreign, as a prime force for further economic
development.

PACIFIC OCEAN

@Pacific Ocean:Geography

Location: body of water between Antarctica, Asia, Australia, and the
Western Hemisphere

Geographic coordinates: 0 00 N, 160 00 W

Area:
total: 165.384 million sq km
note: includes Bali Sea, Bellingshausen Sea, Bering Sea, Bering
Strait, Coral Sea, East China Sea, Flores Sea, Gulf of Alaska, Gulf of
Tonkin, Java Sea, Philippine Sea, Ross Sea, Savu Sea, Sea of Japan,
Sea of Okhotsk, South China Sea, Tasman Sea, Timor Sea, and other
tributary water bodies

Area-comparative: about 18 times the size of the US; the largest ocean
(followed by the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the Arctic
Ocean); covers about one-third of the global surface; larger than the
total land area of the world

Coastline: 135,663 km

Climate: planetary air pressure systems and resultant wind patterns
exhibit remarkable uniformity in the south and east; trade winds and
westerly winds are well-developed patterns, modified by seasonal
fluctuations; tropical cyclones (hurricanes) may form south of Mexico
from June to October and affect Mexico and Central America;
continental influences cause climatic uniformity to be much less
pronounced in the eastern and western regions at the same latitude in
the North Pacific Ocean; the western Pacific is monsoonal-a rainy
season occurs during the summer months, when moisture-laden winds blow
from the ocean over the land, and a dry season during the winter
months, when dry winds blow from the Asian land mass back to the
ocean; tropical cyclones (typhoons) may strike southeast and East Asia
from May to December

Terrain: surface currents in the northern Pacific are dominated by a
clockwise, warm-water gyre (broad circular system of currents) and in
the southern Pacific by a counterclockwise, cool-water gyre; in the
northern Pacific, sea ice forms in the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk
in winter; in the southern Pacific, sea ice from Antarctica reaches
its northernmost extent in October; the ocean floor in the eastern
Pacific is dominated by the East Pacific Rise, while the western
Pacific is dissected by deep trenches, including the Mariana Trench,
which is the world's deepest

Elevation extremes:
lowest point: Mariana Trench -10,924 m
highest point: sea level 0 m

Natural resources: oil and gas fields, polymetallic nodules, sand and
gravel aggregates, placer deposits, fish

Natural hazards: surrounded by a zone of violent volcanic and
earthquake activity sometimes referred to as the "Pacific Ring of
Fire"; subject to tropical cyclones (typhoons) in southeast and east
Asia from May to December (most frequent from July to October);
tropical cyclones (hurricanes) may form south of Mexico and strike
Central America and Mexico from June to October (most common in August
and September); southern shipping lanes subject to icebergs from
Antarctica; cyclical El Nino phenomenon occurs off the coast of Peru,
when the trade winds slacken and the warm Equatorial Countercurrent
moves south, killing the plankton that is the primary food source for
anchovies; consequently, the anchovies move to better feeding grounds,
causing resident marine birds to starve by the thousands because of
the loss of their food source; ships subject to superstructure icing
in extreme north from October to May and in extreme south from May to
October; persistent fog in the northern Pacific can be a maritime
hazard from June to December

Environment-current issues: endangered marine species include the
dugong, sea lion, sea otter, seals, turtles, and whales; oil pollution
in Philippine Sea and South China Sea

Environment-international agreements:
party to: none of the selected agreements
signed, but not ratified: none of the selected agreements

Geography-note: the major choke points are the Bering Strait, Panama
Canal, Luzon Strait, and the Singapore Strait; the Equator divides the

@Pacific Ocean:Economy

Economy-overview: The Pacific Ocean is a major contributor to the
world economy and particularly to those nations its waters directly
touch. It provides low-cost sea transportation between East and West,
extensive fishing grounds, offshore oil and gas fields, minerals, and
sand and gravel for the construction industry. In 1985 over half (54%)
of the world's fish catch came from the Pacific Ocean, which is the
only ocean where the fish catch has increased every year since 1978.
Exploitation of offshore oil and gas reserves is playing an
ever-increasing role in the energy supplies of Australia, NZ, China,
US, and Peru. The high cost of recovering offshore oil and gas,
combined with the wide swings in world prices for oil since 1985, has
slowed but not stopped new drillings.

@Pakistan:Economy

Economy-overview: Pakistan continues to suffer through a damaging
foreign exchange crisis. The crisis stems from years of loose fiscal
policies that exacerbated inflation and allowed the public debt, money
supply, and current account deficit to explode. In April 1997, Prime
Minister SHARIF introduced a stimulus package of tax cuts intended to
boost failing industrial output and spur export growth. At that time,
the IMF endorsed the program, paving the way for a $1.5 billion
Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility. Although the economy showed
signs of improvement following the measures, SHARIF has refused to
implement the tough structural reforms necessary for sustained,
longer-term growth. As a consequence, at yearend 1997, industrial
production continued to flag, foreign exchange reserves continued to
teeter around $1 billion-only four weeks of imports-and borrowing to
support the budget deficit already exceeded the amount allocated for
the entire fiscal year. At the same time, the government must cope
with long-standing economic vulnerabilities-inadequate infrastructure,
low levels of literacy, and increasing sectarian, ethnic, and tribal
violence.

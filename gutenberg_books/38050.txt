ALL
(Frightfully Unofficial)
about an OLD FRIEND of mine

What he most probably was
What he most certainly will be
AND WHO HAS DONE THIS?

WHY
THE CAT.




Dedicated to the Notice
OF ALL
The Firms of this Great City
whether
BANKERS BROKERS OR OTHERS
WHO
In their Rise to Wealth and Affluence
have NOT yet
Recognised the "Generous Policy" That their
Success is always partly Due to the Honesty and
Energy of their
SERVANTS,
AND WHO
After taking to Themselves all the
_HONEY_ in the _HIVE_
Leave to the
WORKERS
NOTHING
but the Lees.

"A good Master maketh a good Servant"

ALL
(Frightfully Unofficial)
about an OLD FRIEND of mine

What he most probably was
What he most certainly will be
AND WHO HAS DONE THIS?

WHY
THE CAT.]




[Illustration: What he most probably was,

before he became]


[Illustration: A General-Private-Joint-Continental-Universal-Everlasting
Respectable-Responsible
BANKERS CLERK.

During his 1st year of Service

(Fancies he's got a "good thing")]


[Illustration: At 10 years Service, he has his doubts.]


[Illustration: This is the BC of 20 years Service--he--_hasn't any
doubts now_. Bless you! He knows _all about it, and_ he's going home! To
his--_Dinner_!!!]


[Illustration: HERE IT IS!

AND ought'nt he to be _thankful_]


[Illustration: AT 40, 50, or 150 years Service, _he wonders_ (_ha! ha!_)
Why his old heart may not be eased

_BY A PENSION_

that _he and his_ can live upon, together with a _handsome present_ of
_the remnant of his life_]


[Illustration: But he is informed that if he will send in his
_resignation_ _first_, It will be seen what can be done for him

_Afterwards_

"_Is he quite worn out.?_ not another _6 months_? dear me!

_quite sure?_ Ah!"]


[Illustration: This generous proposal does'nt satisfy our greedy old
friend, so he comes up to the scratch as usual

And he works all day, and he dreams all night]


[Illustration: Once he dreamt (silly Old boy) he dreamt]


[Illustration: He had an _IDEA_!!!

(of course it was only a dream.)]


[Illustration: (His Dream)

Why not appeal to his Masters the DIRECTORS they can but say No. they
are Gentlemen, and _they won't eat him_]


[Illustration: (His Dream)

And of cours.--HOORAY!!!!

The DIRECTORS declare that their _trusted servant_ SHOULD NOT be an
_exception_ to the _Universal Rule_, but that he had risen in value like
everything else AND they further declare, they will not permit, _the man
whose labour increases with their success_, to be _left behind_ by the
butcher, the Baker, or the Candlestick Maker.--_NO_ not to put dividends
into their own pockets,

_OR ANY OTHER MANS_]


[Illustration: (still his dream.)

And Georgiana-Amelia looks more like the girl he took away from the old
Rectory 20 years ago than he ever hoped to see again

Why she's getting FAT!, Sir FAT!]


[Illustration: (but dreams)

And so is Tommy' Sir.]


[Illustration: (very happy dreams)

And Georgiana Amelia, Junior.]


[Illustration: (Are very very seldom)

And so Goodbye, Sir Goodbye. No, we _do not_ live at Poplar now--Why,
yes, quite a change. Just so Good bye to you, Sir

_Hem_--_WE ARE GOING TO CHURCH._]


[Illustration: (REALIZED)

OH! _Are you_.--_You're going to the City_, Old Boy. WHAT!!! _Give you
more pay_--Pooh. Think of the Honorable _Confidence_ your Masters
_cannot help giving you_--Think of that--Very Valuable, Eh.

_Ah! I should think so_, and you had better wake up those Shakey old
legs of yours, or you'll be _Under the Line_]


[Illustration: And one Morning

_he is_ _Under the Line_]


[Illustration: And _THIS is the result of his lifes labour_]


[Illustration:

EXTRAORDINARY COINCIDENCE

SOME BODY
ELSE

HAS BEEN DREAMING

OR

OUR MUTUAL FRIEND

BEING

The FINAL SCRATCHES of

THE CAT

WHO

After this will vanish

And like the baseless
fabrick of a dream
Leave not a wrack behind]


[Illustration: Having attended a Committee of the most exciting and
exhaustive nature "Somebody" indulges in the traditional "40 Winks".]


[Illustration: But the Committee hasn't done with him yet--the "Winks"
are disturbed, and the Phantom of a defunct argument, that _He_ settled
long ago, sits itself rudely on the table, in a Makeshifty sort of way
and insists upon having another "go in".]


[Illustration: And so he thinks, _He_ thinks! his income is too small;
Why _it's Princely_, said the "Shadowy party" whose own "pull" was about
£20,000 a year, He ought to make it do somehow, and if he don't like it
you can manage without him.

Now look here, let me show you an Article.]


[Illustration: _There!!!_

Now I call this cheap.--_There he is_, Salary £40. _and_ white choker
_not_ objected to. (for the matter of that he'll wear plush
or--anything)----Come he's goodlooking. He'll work for you, respect you,
as much as he does himself, be a credit to you, _and_ finally, he's been
in the Pawnbroking line, _says_ _he lives on Oatmeal Porridge--and comes
from the North_

(ED NOTE "Puss" who comes fra' the North hersel, is disgusted with the
"Cad", _and does'nt believe him_.]


[Illustration: His harmless Pursuits----]


[Illustration: And his simple Tastes,----]


[Illustration: Will render him at once the _ornament_ and "Prop" of your
Establisment.--]


[Illustration: _And_ if in the ingenuous enthusiasm of his _Generous_
Nature, _he should_ by chance "run short"; He's _not the man_ to pester
you with Petitions. _He_ has a soul above _asking for Money_.]


[Illustration: Just so--,]


[Illustration: Ha! Ha! laughed "Somebody", to "the" great danger of the
"Winks"; _Of course_, and we shouldn't dream of taking such a scamp.
_We_, Hem, have _always_ drawn _Our_ staff from a _very_ different
class, and _why_ shouldn't we always do so, _We_ are quite satisfied
with them, and our Business, and our Profits are Increasing
yearly.----Upon my word said "Somebody" _everything_ connected with "Our
House" gives me unlimited satisfaction.]


[Illustration: And you are going to make the satisfaction just a _leetle
Mutual_; Sir, indeed we ought to thank you very much; Said a new and
most impertinent Essence, who appeared, somewhat prematurely, to have
made up his mind, and so settled the question out of hand.]


[Illustration: What do you mean, Sir. We don't require _your_
interference said "Somebody" (who couldn't encourage that sort of
thing). I see they forgot the Doctor, and no doubt your _Wife will go_
to church. Yes, that sort of thing does cost _something_, and you
couldn't very well stop her, no, no. And I see you _never_ spend _any
money_ for Conveyance, and you never have _any_ recreation, or change of
air; nothing to help through the dismal monotony of your 12 days holiday
in _November_ or _February_ and you can't even afford "8 hours at the
Sea Side" for the Wife and little ones. In fact you've no money. _no
comfort! no Pipe! no Glass! no music! no Paper! no nothing._

Well!!! said "Somebody" you're an _Extraordinary Man_--_but I don't
believe you_--Now I can _understand this_. _You cannot afford_ _any_ of
these things, _that_ is clear. But Human Nature is frail, and Alas!
B.C.s _are but_ Human. Come, Sir confess at least _to some of these
iniquities_, and then--_What is the consequence?_]


[Illustration: Why 50 per cent of you get into debt, and you know it
Said "Somebody" do you think you can decieve me? Why its clear that if
you will _really_ make out a list of The Butcher, The Baker, The Water
rate, The _Poor Rate_!! and the Income Tax (every penny--poor devil) and
_all the other luxuries in which you indulge_. Why both ends _can't_
meet]


[Illustration: Somebody Somebody, Esquire

Of course they wont. I've said so before. Give you my Vote and Interest?
Do we wish to conduct our Business on the "Old Clo" principle, like a
Firm of Jew Slopmakers? said "Somebody", getting Indignant, and
dangerously red about the Face--NO! very well. Give you my Vote and
Interest? _I always have._ Give them again?----(you know young man, this
is all very unofficial--well then) Yes.--_I Will_]


[Illustration: And "Somebody" said "I will" so loudly that he woke
himself up.]


[Illustration: And "Somebody" _who was "Somebody"_ (may his shadow never
be less) _did_ give his Vote and Interest.

_And the result_, some of it is in my Pocket (_long may it stop there_)
the Result is, that _Our House_ is up to _any Amount of Work_ and will
undertake _to beat the Cheap Jacks into Fits_

Let us hope the example of "our little Shop" will be catching

Now then ALLTOGETHER
    AND SO SAY ALL OF US
    AND SO SAY ALL OF US
FOR HE IS A JOLLY GOOD

SOMEBODY COMING

See him do it!

Puss in taking leave of his Friends _Congratulates_ them on the _Fact_
that _they know who is_ OUR "MUTUAL FRIEND" (and it isn't everyone can
say that). In conclusion it is to be hoped that "Nobody" will be the
only person so _unfeline_ as to dream of

"PUTTING A STOPPER ON THE CAT'S MEAT"]

forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

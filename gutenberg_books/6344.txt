Aruba

Introduction

Aruba

Background:  Discovered and claimed for Spain in 1499, Aruba was acquired
by the Dutch in 1636.  The island's economy has been dominated by three
main industries. A 19th century gold rush was followed by prosperity
brought on by the opening in 1924 of an oil refinery. The last decades of
the 20th century saw a boom in the tourism industry. Aruba seceded from
the Netherlands Antilles in 1986 and became a separate, autonomous member
of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Movement toward full independence
was halted at Aruba's request in 1990.

Economy Aruba

Economy - overview:  Tourism is the mainstay of the small, open Aruban
economy, with offshore banking and oil refining and storage also
important. The rapid growth of the tourism sector over the last decade
has resulted in a substantial expansion of other activities. Construction
has boomed, with hotel capacity five times the 1985 level. In addition,
the reopening of the country's oil refinery in 1993, a major source
of employment and foreign exchange earnings, has further spurred
growth. Aruba's small labor force and low unemployment rate have led
to a large number of unfilled job vacancies, despite sharp rises in
wage rates in recent years. The government's goal of balancing the
budget within two years will hamper expenditures, as will the decline
in stopover tourist arrivals following the 11 September terrorist attacks.

Economy Antigua and Barbuda

Economy - overview:  Tourism continues to dominate the economy, accounting
for more than half of GDP. Weak tourist arrival numbers since early
2000 have slowed the economy, however, and pressed the government into a
tight fiscal corner. The dual-island nation's agricultural production is
focused on the domestic market and constrained by a limited water supply
and a labor shortage stemming from the lure of higher wages in tourism
and construction work. Manufacturing comprises enclave-type assembly for
export with major products being bedding, handicrafts, and electronic
components. Prospects for economic growth in the medium term will continue
to depend on income growth in the industrialized world, especially in
the US, which accounts for about one-third of all tourist arrivals.

Afghanistan

Introduction

Afghanistan

Background:  Afghanistan's recent history is characterized by war
and civil strife, with intermittent periods of relative calm and
stability. The Soviet Union invaded in 1979 but was forced to withdraw 10
years later by anti-Communist mujahidin forces supplied and trained by the
US, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and others. Fighting subsequently continued
among the various mujahidin factions, giving rise to a state of warlordism
that spawned the Taliban in the early 1990s. The Taliban was able to seize
most of the country, aside from Northern Alliance strongholds primarily
in the northeast, until US and allied military action in support of the
opposition following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks forced the
group's downfall. The four largest Afghan opposition groups met in Bonn,
Germany, in late 2001 and agreed on a plan for the formulation of a new
government structure that resulted in the inauguration of Hamid KARZAI
as Chairman of the Afghan Interim Authority (AIA) on 22 December 2001.
In addition to occasionally violent political jockeying and ongoing
military action to root out remaining terrorists and Taliban elements,

Economy Afghanistan

Economy - overview:  Afghanistan is an extremely poor, landlocked
country, highly dependent on farming and livestock raising (sheep and
goats). Economic considerations have played second fiddle to political
and military upheavals during two decades of war, including the nearly
10-year Soviet military occupation (which ended 15 February 1989). During
that conflict one-third of the population fled the country, with Pakistan
and Iran sheltering a combined peak of more than 6 million refugees.
Gross domestic product has fallen substantially over the past 20 years
because of the loss of labor and capital and the disruption of trade
and transport; severe drought added to the nation's difficulties
in 1998-2001. The majority of the population continues to suffer
from insufficient food, clothing, housing, and medical care, problems
exacerbated by military operations and political uncertainties. Inflation
remains a serious problem. Following the US-led coalition war that led
to the defeat of the Taliban in November 2001 and the formulation of
the Afghan Interim Authority (AIA) resulting from the December 2001 Bonn
Agreement, International efforts to rebuild Afghanistan were addressed at
the Tokyo Donors Conference for Afghan Reconstruction in January 2002,
when $4.5 billion was collected for a trust fund to be administered
by the World Bank. Priority areas for reconstruction include the
construction of education, health, and sanitation facilities, enhancement
of administrative capacity, the development of the agricultural sector,
and the rebuilding of road, energy, and telecommunication links.

Algeria

Introduction

Algeria

Background:  After a century of rule by France, Algeria became independent
in 1962. The surprising first round success of the fundamentalist FIS
(Islamic Salvation Front) party in the December 1991 balloting caused the
army to intervene, crack down on the FIS, and postpone the subsequent
elections. The FIS response has resulted in a continuous low-grade
civil conflict with the secular state apparatus, which nonetheless has
allowed elections featuring pro-government and moderate religious-based
parties. FIS's armed wing, the Islamic Salvation Army, disbanded itself
in January 2000 and many armed militants surrendered under an amnesty
program designed to promote national reconciliation. Nevertheless,
residual fighting continues. Other concerns include Berber unrest,
large-scale unemployment, a shortage of housing, and the need to diversify
the petroleum-based economy.

Economy Algeria

Economy - overview:  The hydrocarbons sector is the backbone of the
economy, accounting for roughly 60% of budget revenues, 30% of GDP,
and over 95% of export earnings.  Algeria has the fifth-largest reserves
of natural gas in the world and is the second largest gas exporter; it
ranks 14th in oil reserves. Algeria's financial and economic indicators
improved during the mid-1990s, in part because of policy reforms supported
by the IMF and debt rescheduling from the Paris Club. Algeria's finances
in 2000 and 2001 benefited from the temporary spike in oil prices and
the government's tight fiscal policy, leading to a large increase in the
trade surplus, record highs in foreign exchange reserves, and reduction in
foreign debt. The government's continued efforts to diversify the economy
by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector
has had little success in reducing high unemployment and improving living
standards. In 2001, the government signed an Association Treaty with
the European Union that will eventually lower tariffs and increase trade.

Azerbaijan

Introduction

Azerbaijan

Background:  Azerbaijan - a nation of Turkic Muslims - has been
an independent republic since the collapse of the Soviet Union in
1991. Despite a 1`994 cease-fire, Azerbaijan has yet to resolve its
conflict with Armenia over the Azerbaijani Nagorno-Karabakh enclave
(largely Armenian populated). Azerbaijan has lost almost 20% of its
territory and must support some 750,000 refugees and internally displaced
persons as a result of the conflict. Corruption is ubiquitous and the
promise of widespread wealth from Azerbaijan's undeveloped petroleum
resources remains largely unfulfilled.

Geography Azerbaijan

Location:  Southwestern Asia, bordering the Caspian Sea, between Iran
and Russia

Geographic coordinates:  40 30 N, 47 30 E

Map references:  Asia

Area:  total: 86,600 sq km note: includes the exclave of Naxcivan

Environment - current issues:  local scientists consider the Abseron
Yasaqligi (Apsheron Peninsula) (including Baku and Sumqayit) and the
Caspian Sea to be the ecologically most devastated area in the world
because of severe air, water, and soil pollution; soil pollution results
from the use of DDT as a pesticide and also from toxic defoliants used
in the production of cotton

Economy Azerbaijan

Economy - overview:  Azerbaijan's number one export is oil. Azerbaijan's
oil production declined through 1997 but has registered an increase
every year since. Negotiation of production-sharing arrangements
(PSAs) with foreign firms, which have thus far committed $60 billion to
oilfield development, should generate the funds needed to spur future
industrial development.  Oil production under the first of these PSAs,
with the Azerbaijan International Operating Company, began in November
1997. Azerbaijan shares all the formidable problems of the former Soviet
republics in making the transition from a command to a market economy,
but its considerable energy resources brighten its long-term prospects.
Baku has only recently begun making progress on economic reform, and
old economic ties and structures are slowly being replaced. An obstacle
to economic progress, including stepped up foreign investment in the
non-energy sector, is the continuing conflict with Armenia over the
Nagorno-Karabakh region. Trade with Russia and the other former Soviet
republics is declining in importance while trade is building with Turkey
and the nations of Europe.  Long-term prospects will depend on world oil
prices, the location of new pipelines in the region, and Azerbaijan's
ability to manage its oil wealth.

from multilateral agreement on dividing the waters and seabed regimes
- Iran insists on division of Caspian Sea into five equal sectors
while Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Turkmenistan have generally
agreed upon equidistant seabed boundaries; Iran threatens to conduct oil
exploration in Azerbaijani-claimed waters, while interdicting Azerbaijani
activities; Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan await ICJ decision to resolve
sovereignty dispute over oilfields in the Caspian Sea

Albania

Background:  In 1990 Albania ended 44 years of xenophobic communist
rule and established a multiparty democracy. The transition has
proven difficult as corrupt governments have tried to deal with high

local elections in 2001 to be acceptable and a step toward democratic
development, but identified serious deficiencies which should be addressed
through reforms in the Albanian electoral code.

Economy Albania

Economy - overview:  Poor and backward by European standards, Albania is
making the difficult transition to a more modern open-market economy. The
government has taken measures to curb violent crime and to revive economic
activity and trade.  The economy is bolstered by remittances from abroad
of $400-$600 million annually, mostly from Greece and Italy. Agriculture,
which accounts for 52% of GDP, is held back because of frequent drought
and the need to modernize equipment and consolidate small plots of
land. Severe energy shortages are forcing small firms out of business,
increasing unemployment, scaring off foreign investors, and spurring
inflation.

GDP:  purchasing power parity - $13.2 billion (2001 est.)

Armenia

Introduction

Armenia

Background:  An Armenian Apostolic Christian country, Armenia was
incorporated into Russia in 1828 and the USSR in 1920. Armenian
leaders remain preoccupied by the long conflict with Azerbaijan over
Nagorno-Karabakh, a primarily Armenian-populated region, assigned to
Soviet Azerbaijan in the 1920s by Moscow. Armenia and Azerbaijan began
fighting over the area in 1988; the struggle escalated after both
countries attained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. By
May 1994, when a cease-fire took hold, Armenian forces held not
only Nagorno-Karabakh but also a significant portion of Azerbaijan
proper. The economies of both sides have been hurt by their inability
to make substantial progress toward a peaceful resolution.

Economy Armenia

Economy - overview:  Under the old Soviet central planning system,
Armenia had developed a modern industrial sector, supplying machine
tools, textiles, and other manufactured goods to sister republics in
exchange for raw materials and energy.  Since the implosion of the
USSR in December 1991, Armenia has switched to small-scale agriculture
away from the large agroindustrial complexes of the Soviet era. The
agricultural sector has long-term needs for more investment and updated
technology. The privatization of industry has been at a slower pace, but
has been given renewed emphasis by the current administration. Armenia
is a food importer, and its mineral deposits (gold, bauxite) are small.
The ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan over the ethnic Armenian-dominated
region of Nagorno-Karabakh and the breakup of the centrally directed
economic system of the former Soviet Union contributed to a severe
economic decline in the early 1990s. By 1994, however, the Armenian
Government had launched an ambitious IMF-sponsored economic program
that has resulted in positive growth rates in 1995-2001. Armenia also
managed to slash inflation and to privatize most small- and medium-sized
enterprises. The chronic energy shortages Armenia suffered in recent
years have been largely offset by the energy supplied by one of its
nuclear power plants at Metsamor. Armenia's severe trade imbalance has
been offset somewhat by international aid, domestic restructuring of
the economy, and foreign direct investment.

Economy Andorra

Economy - overview:  Tourism, the mainstay of Andorra's tiny, well-to-do
economy, accounts for roughly 80% of GDP. An estimated 9 million tourists
visit annually, attracted by Andorra's duty-free status and by its summer
and winter resorts. Andorra's comparative advantage has recently eroded
as the economies of neighboring France and Spain have been opened up,
providing broader availability of goods and lower tariffs. The banking
sector, with its "tax haven" status, also contributes substantially to
the economy. Agricultural production is limited - only 2% of the land
is arable - and most food has to be imported.  The principal livestock
activity is sheep raising. Manufacturing output consists mainly of
cigarettes, cigars, and furniture.  Andorra is a member of the EU Customs
Union and is treated as an EU member for trade in manufactured goods
(no tariffs) and as a non-EU member for agricultural products.

Angola

Introduction

Angola

Background:  Civil war has been the norm in Angola since independence
from Portugal in 1975. A 1994 peace accord between the government and the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) provided for
the integration of former UNITA insurgents into the government and armed
forces. A national unity government was installed in April of 1997, but
serious fighting resumed in late 1998, rendering hundreds of thousands of
people homeless. Up to 1.5 million lives may have been lost in fighting
over the past quarter century. The death of Jonas SAVIMBI and a cease
fire with UNITA may bode well for the country.

Economy Angola

Economy - overview:  Angola is an economy in disarray because of a quarter
century of nearly continuous warfare. Subsistence agriculture provides
the main livelihood for 85% of the population. Oil production and the
supporting activities are vital to the economy, contributing about 45%
to GDP and 90% of exports. Violence continues, millions of land mines
remain, and many farmers are reluctant to return to their fields. As
a result, much of the country's food must still be imported. To fully
take advantage of its rich natural resources - gold, diamonds, extensive
forests, Atlantic fisheries, and large oil deposits - Angola will need
to end its conflict and continue reforming government policies. Internal
strife discourages investment outside of the petroleum sector, which
is producing roughly 800,000 barrels of oil per day. While Angola made
progress in bringing inflation down further, from over 300% in 2000 to
about 110% in 2001, the government has failed to make sufficient progress
on reforms recommended by the IMF, such as increasing foreign exchange
reserves and promoting greater transparency in government spending.
Angola's GDP could be among the world's fastest growing in 2002 if oil
production from the Girassol field, which began production in December
2001, reaches 200,000 barrels per day as expected.

American Samoa

Introduction

American Samoa

Background:  Settled as early as 1000 B. C., Samoa was "discovered"
by European explorers in the 18th century. International rivalries in
the latter half of the 19th century were settled by an 1899 treaty in
which Germany and the US divided the Samoan archipelago. The US formally
occupied its portion - a smaller group of eastern islands with the
excellent harbor of Pago Pago - the following year.

Economy American Samoa

Economy - overview:  This is a traditional Polynesian economy in which
more than 90% of the land is communally owned. Economic activity
is strongly linked to the US, with which American Samoa conducts
most of its foreign trade.  Tuna fishing and tuna processing plants
are the backbone of the private sector, with canned tuna the primary
export. Transfers from the US Government add substantially to American
Samoa's economic well-being. Attempts by the government to develop a
larger and broader economy are restrained by Samoa's remote location,
its limited transportation, and its devastating hurricanes. Tourism,
a developing sector, has been held back by the recurring financial
difficulties in East Asia.

Argentina

Introduction

Argentina

Background:  Following independence from Spain in 1816, Argentina
experienced periods of internal political conflict between conservatives
and liberals and between civilian and military factions. After World
War II, a long period of Peronist authoritarian rule and interference in
subsequent governments was followed by a military junta that took power
in 1976. Democracy returned in 1983, and numerous elections since then
have underscored Argentina's progress in democratic consolidation.

Economy Argentina

Economy - overview:  Argentina benefits from rich natural resources,
a highly literate population, an export-oriented agricultural sector,
and a diversified industrial base. However, when President Carlos MENEM
took office in 1989, the country had piled up huge external debts,
inflation had reached 200% per month, and output was plummeting. To
combat the economic crisis, the government embarked on a path of trade
liberalization, deregulation, and privatization. In 1991, it implemented
radical monetary reforms which pegged the peso to the US dollar and
limited the growth in the monetary base by law to the growth in reserves.
Inflation fell sharply in subsequent years. In 1995, the Mexican peso
crisis produced capital flight, the loss of banking system deposits,
and a severe, but short-lived, recession; a series of reforms to bolster
the domestic banking system followed. Real GDP growth recovered strongly,
reaching 8% in 1997. In 1998, international financial turmoil caused by
Russia's problems and increasing investor anxiety over Brazil produced
the highest domestic interest rates in more than three years, halving the
growth rate of the economy. Conditions worsened in 1999 with GDP falling
by 3%. President Fernando DE LA RUA, who took office in December 1999,
sponsored tax increases and spending cuts to reduce the deficit, which
had ballooned to 2.5% of GDP in 1999. Growth in 2000 was a negative
0.5%, as both domestic and foreign investors remained skeptical of the
government's ability to pay debts and maintain the peso's fixed exchange
rate with the US dollar. The economic situation worsened still further in
2001 with the widening of spreads on Argentine bonds, massive withdrawals
from the banks, and a further decline in consumer and investor confidence.
Government efforts to achieve a "zero deficit", to stabilize the banking
system, and to restore economic growth proved inadequate in the face
of the mounting economic problems. At the start of 2002, newly elected
president Eduardo DUHALDE met with IMF officials to secure an additional
$20 billion loan, but immediate action seemed unlikely. The peso's peg
to the dollar was abandoned in January 2002, and the peso was floated
from the dollar in February; inflation picked up rapidly.

Telephone system:  general assessment: by opening the telecommunications
market to competition and foreign investment with the "Telecommunications
Liberalization Plan of 1998", Argentina encouraged the growth of modern
telecommunication technology; fiber-optic cable trunk lines are being
installed between all major cities; the major networks are entirely
digital and the availability of telephone service is being improved;
however, telephone density is presently minimal, and making telephone
service universally available will take some time domestic: microwave
radio relay, fiber-optic cable, and a domestic satellite system with 40
earth stations serve the trunk network; more than 110,000 pay telephones
are installed and mobile telephone use is rapidly expanding international:
Unisur submarine cables; two international gateways near Buenos Aires

Australia

Introduction

Australia

Background:  Australia became a commonwealth of the British Empire
in 1901. It was able to take advantage of its natural resources to
rapidly develop its agricultural and manufacturing industries and to
make a major contribution to the British effort in World Wars I and II.
Long-term concerns include pollution, particularly depletion of the ozone
layer, and management and conservation of coastal areas, especially the
Great Barrier Reef. A referendum to change Australia's status, from a
commonwealth headed by the British monarch to an independent republic,
was defeated in 1999.

Economy Australia

Economy - overview:  Australia has a prosperous Western-style capitalist
economy, with a per capita GDP on par with the four dominant West European
economies. The Australian economy has been resilient in the face of
the global economic downturn in 2001 chalking up 2.3% GDP growth, as
the domestic economy is offsetting the external slump and business and
consumer confidence remains robust. Canberra's emphasis on reforms is
a key factor behind the economy's strength, and Australia is expected
to outperform its trading partners in 2002, with GDP growth projected
to be 3% or better. Australia probably will experience some weakness in
mid-2002 as its business cycle tends to lag the US by about six months,
and larger problems could emerge if Australia's trade position worsens.

Austria

Introduction

Austria

Background:  Once the center of power for the large Austro-Hungarian
Empire, Austria was reduced to a small republic after its defeat in
World War I. Following annexation by Nazi Germany in 1938 and subsequent
occupation by the victorious Allies in 1945, Austria's status remained
unclear for a decade. A State Treaty signed in 1955 ended the occupation,
recognized Austria's independence, and forbade unification with
Germany. A constitutional law of that same year declared the country's
"perpetual neutrality" as a condition for Soviet military withdrawal. This
neutrality, once ingrained as part of the Austrian cultural identity,
has been called into question since the Soviet collapse of 1991 and
Austria's entry into the European Union in 1995. A prosperous country,
Austria entered the European Monetary Union in 1999.

Economy Austria

Economy - overview:  Austria, with its well-developed market economy
and high standard of living, is closely tied to other EU economies,
especially Germany's.  Membership in the EU has drawn an influx of foreign
investors attracted by Austria's access to the single European market
and proximity to EU aspirant economies. Slowing growth in Germany and
elsewhere in the world slowed the economy to only 1.2% growth in 2001;
the economy is expected to do little better in 2002. To meet increased
competition from both EU and Central European countries, Austria will
need to emphasize knowledge-based sectors of the economy, continue to
deregulate the service sector, and lower its tax burden.

Anguilla

Introduction

Anguilla

Background:  Colonized by English settlers from Saint Kitts in 1650,
Anguilla was administered by Great Britain until the early 19th century,
when the island - against the wishes of the inhabitants - was incorporated
into a single British dependency along with Saint Kitts and Nevis. Several
attempts at separation failed. In 1971, two years after a revolt,
Anguilla was finally allowed to secede; this arrangement was formally
recognized in 1980 with Anguilla becoming a separate British dependency.

Economy Anguilla

Economy - overview:  Anguilla has few natural resources, and the economy
depends heavily on luxury tourism, offshore banking, lobster fishing,
and remittances from emigrants. Increased activity in the tourism
industry, which has spurred the growth of the construction sector, has
contributed to economic growth. Anguillan officials have put substantial
effort into developing the offshore financial sector, which is small,
but growing. In the medium term, prospects for the economy will depend
largely on the tourism sector and, therefore, on revived income growth
in the industrialized nations as well as on favorable weather conditions.

Antarctica

Introduction

Antarctica

Background:  Speculation over the existence of a "southern land" was
not confirmed until the early 1820s when British and American commercial
operators and British and Russian national expeditions began exploring
the Antarctic Peninsula region and other areas south of the Antarctic
Circle. Not until 1840 was it established that Antarctica was indeed a
continent and not just a group of islands. Several exploration "firsts"
were achieved in the early 20th century. Following World War II, there was
an upsurge in scientific research on the continent. A number of countries
have set up year-round research stations on Antarctica. Seven have made
territorial claims, but no other country recognizes these claims. In
order to form a legal framework for the activities of nations on the
continent, an Antarctic Treaty was negotiated that neither denies nor
gives recognition to existing territorial claims; signed in 1959, it
entered into force in 1961.

Geography Antarctica

Location:  continent mostly south of the Antarctic Circle

Geographic coordinates:  90 00 S, 0 00 E

Map references:  Antarctic Region

Area:  total: 14 million sq km note: fifth-largest continent, following
Asia, Africa, North America, and South America, but larger than Australia
and the subcontinent of Europe land: 14 million sq km (280,000 sq km
ice-free, 13.72 million sq km ice-covered) (est.)

Area - comparative:  slightly less than 1.5 times the size of the US

Land boundaries:  0 km note: see entry on International disputes

Coastline:  17,968 km

Maritime claims:  none; 20 of 27 Antarctic consultative nations have made
no claims to Antarctic territory (although Russia and the US have reserved
the right to do so) and do not recognize the claims of the other nations;
also see the Disputes - international entry

Climate:  severe low temperatures vary with latitude, elevation, and
distance from the ocean; East Antarctica is colder than West Antarctica
because of its higher elevation; Antarctic Peninsula has the most moderate
climate; higher temperatures occur in January along the coast and average
slightly below freezing

Terrain:  about 98% thick continental ice sheet and 2% barren rock, with
average elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters; mountain ranges up to
nearly 5,000 meters; ice-free coastal areas include parts of southern
Victoria Land, Wilkes Land, the Antarctic Peninsula area, and parts of
Ross Island on McMurdo Sound; glaciers form ice shelves along about half
of the coastline, and floating ice shelves constitute 11% of the area
of the continent

Elevation extremes:  lowest point: Bentley Subglacial Trench -2,555 m
highest point: Vinson Massif 4,897 m note: the lowest known land point
in Antarctica is hidden in the Bentley Subglacial Trench; at its surface
is the deepest ice yet discovered and the world's lowest elevation not
under seawater

Natural resources:  iron ore, chromium, copper, gold, nickel, platinum
and other minerals, and coal and hydrocarbons have been found in small
uncommercial quantities; none presently exploited; krill, finfish,
and crab have been taken by commercial fisheries

Land use:  arable land: 0% permanent crops: 0% other: 100% (ice 98%,
barren rock 2%) (1998 est.)

Irrigated land:  0 sq km (1998 est.)

Natural hazards:  katabatic (gravity-driven) winds blow coastward from
the high interior; frequent blizzards form near the foot of the plateau;
cyclonic storms form over the ocean and move clockwise along the coast;
volcanism on Deception Island and isolated areas of West Antarctica; other
seismic activity rare and weak; large icebergs may calve from ice shelf

Environment - current issues:  in 1998, NASA satellite data showed
that the antarctic ozone hole was the largest on record, covering 27
million square kilometers; researchers in 1997 found that increased
ultraviolet light coming through the hole damages the DNA of icefish,
an antarctic fish lacking hemoglobin; ozone depletion earlier was shown
to harm one-celled antarctic marine plants; in 2002, significant areas
of ice shelves disintegrated in response to regional warming

Geography - note:  the coldest, windiest, highest (on average), and driest
continent; during summer, more solar radiation reaches the surface at
the South Pole than is received at the Equator in an equivalent period;
mostly uninhabitable

People Antarctica

Population:  no indigenous inhabitants, but there are seasonally staffed
research stations note: approximately 27 nations, all signatory to
the Antarctic Treaty, send personnel to perform seasonal (summer) and
year-round research on the continent and in its surrounding oceans; the
population of persons doing and supporting science on the continent and
its nearby islands south of 60 degrees south latitude (the region covered
by the Antarctic Treaty) varies from approximately 4,000 in summer to
1,000 in winter; in addition, approximately 1,000 personnel including
ship's crew and scientists doing onboard research are present in the
waters of the treaty region; summer (January) population - 3,687 total;

Antarctica

Government type:  Antarctic Treaty Summary - the Antarctic Treaty,
signed on 1 December 1959 and entered into force on 23 June 1961,
establishes the legal framework for the management of Antarctica. The
24th Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting was held in Russia in
July 2001. At the end of 2001, there were 45 treaty member nations:
27 consultative and 18 non-consultative. Consultative (voting) members
include the seven nations that claim portions of Antarctica as national
territory (some claims overlap) and 20 nonclaimant nations. The US and
Russia have reserved the right to make claims. The US does not recognize
the claims of others. Antarctica is administered through meetings of the
consultative member nations. Decisions from these meetings are carried out
by these member nations (within their areas) in accordance with their own
national laws. The year in parentheses indicates when an acceding nation
was voted to full consultative (voting) status, while no date indicates
the country was an original 1959 treaty signatory. Claimant nations are
- Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, New Zealand, Norway, and the UK.
Nonclaimant consultative nations are - Belgium, Brazil (1983), Bulgaria
(1998) China (1985), Ecuador (1990), Finland (1989), Germany (1981), India
(1983), Italy (1987), Japan, South Korea (1989), Netherlands (1990),
Peru (1989), Poland (1977), Russia, South Africa, Spain (1988), Sweden
(1988), Uruguay (1985), and the US. Non-consultative (nonvoting) members,
with year of accession in parentheses, are - Austria (1987), Canada
(1988), Colombia (1989), Cuba (1984), Czech Republic (1993), Denmark
(1965), Estonia (2001), Greece (1987), Guatemala (1991), Hungary (1984),
North Korea (1987), Papua New Guinea (1981), Romania (1971), Slovakia
(1993), Switzerland (1990), Turkey (1995), Ukraine (1992), and Venezuela
(1999). Article 1 - area to be used for peaceful purposes only; military
activity, such as weapons testing, is prohibited, but military personnel
and equipment may be used for scientific research or any other peaceful
purpose; Article 2 - freedom of scientific investigation and cooperation
shall continue; Article 3 - free exchange of information and personnel,
cooperation with the UN and other international agencies; Article 4 -
does not recognize, dispute, or establish territorial claims and no
new claims shall be asserted while the treaty is in force; Article 5 -
prohibits nuclear explosions or disposal of radioactive wastes; Article 6
- includes under the treaty all land and ice shelves south of 60 degrees
00 minutes south and reserves high seas rights; Article 7 - treaty-state
observers have free access, including aerial observation, to any area and
may inspect all stations, installations, and equipment; advance notice
of all expeditions and of the introduction of military personnel must be
given; Article 8 - allows for jurisdiction over observers and scientists
by their own states; Article 9 - frequent consultative meetings take
place among member nations; Article 10 - treaty states will discourage
activities by any country in Antarctica that are contrary to the treaty;
Article 11 - disputes to be settled peacefully by the parties concerned
or, ultimately, by the ICJ; Articles 12, 13, 14 - deal with upholding,
interpreting, and amending the treaty among involved nations. Other
agreements - some 200 recommendations adopted at treaty consultative
meetings and ratified by governments include - Agreed Measures for Fauna
and Flora (1964) which were later incorporated into the Environmental
Protocol; Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals (1972);
Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources
(1980); a mineral resources agreement was signed in 1988 but remains
unratified; the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic
Treaty was signed 4 October 1991 and entered into force 14 January 1998;
this agreement provides for the protection of the Antarctic environment
through five specific annexes: 1) marine pollution, 2) fauna and flora,
3) environmental impact assessments, 4) waste management, and 5) protected
area management; it prohibits all activities relating to mineral resources
except scientific research.

Legal system:  Antarctica is administered through meetings of the
consultative member nations.  Decisions from these meetings are carried
out by these member nations (within their areas) in accordance with their
own national laws. US law, including certain criminal offenses by or
against US nationals, such as murder, may apply extra-territorially. Some
US laws directly apply to Antarctica. For example, the Antarctic
Conservation Act, 16 U.S.C. section 2401 et seq., provides civil and
criminal penalties for the following activities, unless authorized
by regulation of statute:  plants and animals; entry into specially
protected areas; the discharge or disposal of pollutants; and the
importation into the US of certain items from Antarctica. Violation
of the Antarctic Conservation Act carries penalties of up to $10,000
in fines and one year in prison. The National Science Foundation and
Department of Justice share enforcement responsibilities. Public Law
95-541, the US Antarctic Conservation Act of 1978, as amended in 1996,
requires expeditions from the US to Antarctica to notify, in advance,
the Office of Oceans and Polar Affairs, Room 5801, Department of State,
Washington, DC 20520, which reports such plans to other nations as
required by the Antarctic Treaty. For more information, contact Permit
Office, Office of Polar Programs, National Science Foundation, Arlington,
Virginia 22230; telephone: Economy Antarctica

Economy - overview:  Fishing off the coast and tourism, both based abroad,
account for the limited economic activity. Antarctic fisheries in 2000-01
(1 July-30 June) reported landing 112,934 metric tons. Unregulated fishing
probably landed more fish than the regulated fishery, and allegedly
illegal fishing in antarctic waters in 1998 resulted in the seizure (by
France and Australia) of at least eight fishing ships. The Convention
on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources determines the
recommended catch limits for marine species. A total of 12,248 tourists
visited in the 2000-01 antarctic summer, down from the 14,762 who visited
the previous year. Nearly all of them were passengers on 21 commercial
(nongovernmental) ships and several yachts that made trips during the
summer. Most tourist trips lasted approximately two weeks.

a military nature, such as the establishment of military bases and
fortifications, the carrying out of military maneuvers, or the testing of
any type of weapon; it permits the use of military personnel or equipment
for scientific research or for any other peaceful purposes

Transnational Issues Antarctica

Disputes - international:  Antarctic Treaty freezes claims (see Antarctic
Treaty Summary in Government type entry); sections (some overlapping)
claimed by Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, NZ, Norway, and UK;
the US and most other states do not recognize the territorial claims
of other states and have made no claims themselves (the US and Russia
reserve the right to do so); no claims have been made in the sector
between 90 degrees west and 150 degrees west; several states with land
claims in Antarctica have expressed their intention to submit data to
the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf to extend their
continental shelf claims to adjoining undersea ridges

Bahrain

Introduction

Bahrain

Background:  Bahrain's small size and central location among Persian Gulf
countries require it to play a delicate balancing act in foreign affairs
among its larger neighbors. Possessing minimal oil reserves, Bahrain has
turned to petroleum processing and refining, and has transformed itself
into an international banking center. The new amir is pushing economic
and political reforms, and has worked to improve relations with the Shi'a
community. In February 2001, Bahraini voters approved a referendum on
the National Action Charter - the centerpiece of the amir's political
liberalization program.

Economy Bahrain

Economy - overview:  In Bahrain, petroleum production and refining
account for about 60% of export receipts, 60% of government revenues,

facilities, Bahrain is home to numerous multinational firms with business
in the Gulf.  Bahrain is dependent on Saudi Arabia for oil revenue granted
as aid. A large share of exports consists of petroleum products made from
refining imported crude. Construction proceeds on several major industrial
projects. Unemployment, especially among the young, and the depletion of
oil and underground water resources are major long-term economic problems.

Economy Barbados

Economy - overview:  Historically, the Barbadian economy had been
dependent on sugarcane cultivation and related activities, but production
in recent years has diversified into manufacturing and tourism. Offshore
finance and information services are important foreign exchange earners,
and there is also a light manufacturing sector. The government continues
its efforts to reduce unemployment, encourage direct foreign investment,
and privatize remaining state-owned enterprises. The economy contracted
in 2001 due to slowdowns in tourism and consumer spending. Growth will
remain anemic in 2002 with a recovery likely near the end of the year.

Economy Botswana

Economy - overview:  Botswana has maintained one of the world's highest
growth rates since independence in 1966. Through fiscal discipline and
sound management, Botswana has transformed itself from one of the poorest
countries in the world to a middle-income country with a per capita GDP of
$7,800 in 2001. Two major investment services rank Botswana as the best
credit risk in Africa. Diamond mining has fueled much of expansion and
currently accounts for more than one-third of GDP and for four-fifths
of export earnings. Tourism, subsistence farming, and cattle raising
are other key sectors. On the downside, the government must deal with
high rates of unemployment and poverty. Unemployment officially is 21%,
but unofficial estimates place it closer to 40%. HIV/AIDS infection
rates are the highest in the world and threaten Botswana's impressive
economic gains.

new reinsurance companies have located on the island, contributing to
the expansion of an already robust international business sector. On
the negative side, Bermuda's already weakening tourism industry - which
derives over 80% of its visitors from the US - has been further hit as
American tourists have chosen not to travel. Most capital equipment
and food must be imported, with the US serving as the primary source
of goods, followed by the UK. Bermuda's industrial sector is small,
although construction continues to be important. Agriculture is limited,
only 6% of the land being arable.

Introduction

Belgium

Background:  Belgium became independent from the Netherlands in 1830
and was occupied by Germany during World Wars I and II. It has prospered
in the past half century as a modern, technologically advanced European
state and member of NATO and the EU. Tensions between the Dutch-speaking
Flemings of the north and the French-speaking Walloons of the south have
led in recent years to constitutional amendments granting these regions
formal recognition and autonomy.

Economy Belgium

Economy - overview:  This modern private enterprise economy has
capitalized on its central geographic location, highly developed transport
network, and diversified industrial and commercial base. Industry is
concentrated mainly in the populous Flemish area in the north. With few
natural resources, Belgium must import substantial quantities of raw
materials and export a large volume of manufactures, making its economy
unusually dependent on the state of world markets. About three-quarters of
its trade is with other EU countries. Belgium's public debt is expected
to fall to about 100% of GDP in 2002, and the government has succeeded
in balancing its budget. Belgium, together with 11 of its EU partners,
began circulating euro currency in January 2002.  Economic growth in
2001 dropped sharply due to the global economic slowdown. Prospects for
2002 depend largely on recovery in the EU and the US.

Economy Bahamas, The

Economy - overview:  The Bahamas is a stable, developing nation with
an economy heavily dependent on tourism and offshore banking. Tourism
alone accounts for more than 60% of GDP and directly or indirectly
employs almost half of the archipelago's labor force. Steady growth in
tourism receipts and a boom in construction of new hotels, resorts, and
residences have led to solid GDP growth in recent years. Manufacturing
and agriculture together contribute approximately a tenth of GDP
and show little growth, despite government incentives aimed at those
sectors. Overall growth prospects in the short run rest heavily on
the fortunes of the tourism sector, which depends on growth in the US,
the source of the majority of tourist visitors.

Economy Bangladesh

Economy - overview:  Despite sustained domestic and international efforts
to improve economic and demographic prospects, Bangladesh remains a
poor, overpopulated, and ill-governed nation. Although more than half
of GDP is generated through the service sector, nearly two-thirds of
Bangladeshis are employed in the agriculture sector, with rice as the
single most important product. Major impediments to growth include
frequent cyclones and floods, inefficient state-owned enterprises,
inadequate port facilities, a rapidly growing labor force that cannot be
absorbed by agriculture, delays in exploiting energy resources (natural
gas), insufficient power supplies, and slow implementation of economic
reforms. Economic reform is stalled in many instances by political
infighting and corruption at all levels of government. Progress also has
been blocked by opposition from the bureaucracy, public sector unions,
and other vested interest groups. The newly-elected BNP government,
led by Prime Minister Khaleda ZIA, has the parliamentary strength to
push through needed reforms, but the party's level of political will to
do so remains undetermined.

Economy Belize

Economy - overview:  The small, essentially private enterprise economy is
based primarily on agriculture, agro-based industry, and merchandising,
with tourism and construction assuming greater importance. Sugar,
the chief crop, accounts for nearly half of exports, while the banana
industry is the country's largest employer. The government's expansionary
monetary and fiscal policies, initiated in September 1998, led to GDP
growth of 6.4% in 1999 and 10.5% in 2000. Growth decelerated in 2001 to
3% due to the global slowdown and severe hurricane damage to agriculture,
fishing, and tourism. Major concerns continue to be the rapidly expanding
trade deficit and foreign debt. A key short-term objective remains the
reduction of poverty with the help of international donors.

Bosnia and Herzegovina

Introduction

Bosnia and Herzegovina

Background:  Bosnia and Herzegovina's declaration of sovereignty
in October 1991, was followed by a declaration of independence from
the former Yugoslavia on 3 March 1992 after a referendum boycotted
by ethnic Serbs. The Bosnian Serbs - supported by neighboring Serbia
and Montenegro - responded with armed resistance aimed at partitioning
the republic along ethnic lines and joining Serb-held areas to form a
"greater Serbia." In March 1994, Bosniaks and Croats reduced the number
of warring factions from three to two by signing an agreement creating a
joint Bosniak/Croat Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. On 21 November
1995, in Dayton, Ohio, the warring parties signed a peace agreement
that brought to a halt the three years of interethnic civil strife (the
final agreement was signed in Paris on 14 December 1995). The Dayton
Agreement retained Bosnia and Herzegovina's international boundaries and
created a joint multi-ethnic and democratic government. This national
government was charged with conducting foreign, economic, and fiscal
policy.  Also recognized was a second tier of government comprised of two
entities roughly equal in size: the Bosniak/Croat Federation of Bosnia and
Herzegovina and the Bosnian Serb-led Republika Srpska (RS). The Federation
and RS governments were charged with overseeing internal functions. In
1995-96, a NATO-led international peacekeeping force (IFOR) of 60,000
troops served in Bosnia to implement and monitor the military aspects of
the agreement. IFOR was succeeded by a smaller, NATO-led Stabilization
Force (SFOR) whose mission is to deter renewed hostilities. SFOR remains
in place at the January 2002 level of approximately 18,000 troops,
though further reductions may take place later in the year.

government, comprised of two entities - a joint Bosniak/Croat Federation
of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Bosnian Serb Republika Srpska (RS)
- each presiding over roughly one-half the territory. The Federation
and RS governments are charged with overseeing internal functions. The
Bosniak/Croat Federation is further divided into 10 cantons. The Dayton
Agreement established the Office of the High Representative (OHR) to
oversee the implementation of the civilian aspects of the agreement. About
250 international and 450 local staff members are employed by the OHR.

Economy Bosnia and Herzegovina

Economy - overview:  Bosnia and Herzegovina ranked next to The Former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as the poorest republic in the old
Yugoslav federation.  Although agriculture is almost all in private
hands, farms are small and inefficient, and the republic traditionally
is a net importer of food. Industry has been greatly overstaffed,
one reflection of the socialist economic structure of Yugoslavia. TITO
had pushed the development of military industries in the republic with
the result that Bosnia hosted a large share of Yugoslavia's defense
plants. The bitter interethnic warfare in Bosnia caused production
to plummet by 80% from 1990 to 1995, unemployment to soar, and human
misery to multiply. With an uneasy peace in place, output recovered
in 1996-99 at high percentage rates from a low base; but output growth
slowed in 2000 and 2001. GDP remains far below the 1990 level. Economic
data are of limited use because, although both entities issue figures,
national-level statistics are limited. Moreover, official data do not
capture the large share of activity that occurs on the black market. The
marka - the national currency introduced in 1998 - is now pegged to the
euro, and the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina has dramatically
increased its reserve holdings. Implementation of privatization, however,
has been slow, and local entities only reluctantly support national-level
institutions. Banking reform accelerated in 2001 as all the communist-era
payments bureaus were shut down. The country receives substantial amounts
of reconstruction assistance and humanitarian aid from the international
community but will have to prepare for an era of declining assistance.

Bolivia

Introduction

Bolivia

Background:  Bolivia, named after independence fighter Simon BOLIVAR,
broke away from Spanish rule in 1825; much of its subsequent history has
consisted of a series of nearly 200 coups and counter-coups. Comparatively
democratic civilian rule was established in the 1980s, but leaders have
faced difficult problems of deep-seated poverty, social unrest, and
drug production. Current goals include attracting foreign investment,
strengthening the educational system, continuing the privatization
program, and waging an anticorruption campaign.

Economy Bolivia

Economy - overview:  Bolivia, long one of the poorest and least
developed Latin American countries, has made considerable progress
toward the development of a market-oriented economy. Successes under
President SANCHEZ DE LOZADA (1993-97) included the signing of a free
trade agreement with Mexico and becoming an associate member of the
Southern Cone Common Market (Mercosur), as well as the privatization of
the state airline, telephone company, railroad, electric power company,
and oil company. Growth slowed in 1999, in part due to tight government
budget policies, which limited needed appropriations for anti-poverty
programs, and the fallout from the Asian financial crisis. In 2000, major
civil disturbances in April, and again in September and October, held
down overall growth to 2.5%. Bolivia's GDP failed to grow in 2001 due to
the global slowdown and laggard domestic activity. Growth is expected to
pick up in 2002, but the fiscal deficit and debt burden will remain high.

Economy Burma

Economy - overview:  Burma is a resource-rich country that suffers from
abject rural poverty. The military regime took steps in the early 1990s to
liberalize the economy after decades of failure under the "Burmese Way to
Socialism", but those efforts have since stalled. Burma has been unable
to achieve monetary or fiscal stability, resulting in an economy that
suffers from serious macroeconomic imbalances - including an official
exchange rate that overvalues the Burmese kyat by more than 100 times
the market rate. In addition, most overseas development assistance
ceased after the junta suppressed the democracy movement in 1988 and
subsequently ignored the results of the 1990 election. Burma is data
poor, and official statistics are often dated and inaccurate. Published
estimates of Burma's foreign trade are greatly understated because of
the size of the black market and border trade - often estimated to be
one to two times the official economy.

Afghanistan (potential production in 2001 - 865 metric tons, down 21%
due to drought, and to a lesser extent, eradication; cultivation in 2002
- 105,000 hectares, a 3% decline from 2000); surrender of drug warlord
KHUN SA's Mong Tai Army in January 1996 was hailed by Rangoon as a major
counternarcotics success, but lack of government will and ability to take
on major narcotrafficking groups and lack of serious commitment against
money laundering continues to hinder the overall antidrug effort; major
source of methamphetamine and heroin for regional consumption

Economy Benin

Economy - overview:  The economy of Benin remains underdeveloped and
dependent on subsistence agriculture, cotton production, and regional
trade. Growth in real output averaged a stable 5% in the past five years,
but rapid population rise offset much of this increase. Inflation has
subsided over the past several years. In order to raise growth still
further, Benin plans to attract more foreign investment, place more
emphasis on tourism, facilitate the development of new food processing
systems and agricultural products, and encourage new information and
communication technology. The 2001 privatization policy should continue
in telecommunications, water, electricity, and agriculture in spite of
initial government reluctance. The Paris Club and bilateral creditors
have eased the external debt situation.

Economy Belarus

Economy - overview:  Belarus has seen little structural reform since
1995, when President LUKASHENKO launched the country on the path of
"market socialism." In keeping with this policy, LUKASHENKO reimposed
administrative controls over prices and currency exchange rates and
expanded the state's right to intervene in the management of private
enterprise. In addition to the burdens imposed by high inflation and
persistent trade deficits, businesses have been subject to pressure on
the part of central and local governments, e.g., arbitrary changes in
regulations, numerous rigorous inspections, retroactive application of
new business regulations, and arrests of "disruptive" businessmen and
factory owners. Close relations with Russia, possibly leading to reunion,
color the pattern of economic developments. For the time being, Belarus
remains self-isolated from the West and its open-market economies.

Economy Solomon Islands

Economy - overview:  The bulk of the population depends on agriculture,
fishing, and forestry for at least part of their livelihood. Most
manufactured goods and petroleum products must be imported. The islands
are rich in undeveloped mineral resources such as lead, zinc, nickel,
and gold.  However, severe ethnic violence, the closing of key business
enterprises, and an empty government treasury have led to serious
economic disarray, indeed near collapse. Tanker deliveries of crucial
fuel supplies (including those for electrical generation) have become
sporadic due to the government's inability to pay and attacks against
ships. Telecommunications are threatened by the nonpayment of bills and
by the lack of technical and maintenance staff many of whom have left
the country.

Navassa Island

Introduction

Navassa Island

Background:  This uninhabited island was claimed by the US in 1857 for
its guano, and mining took place between 1865 and 1898. The lighthouse,
built in 1917, was shut down in 1996 and administration of Navassa Island
transferred from the Coast Guard to the Department of the Interior. A 1998
scientific expedition to the island described it as a unique preserve
of Caribbean biodiversity; the following year it became a National
Wildlife Refuge.

Brazil

Introduction

Brazil

Background:  Following three centuries under the rule of Portugal,
Brazil became an independent nation in 1822. By far the largest and most
populous country in South America, Brazil has overcome more than half
a century of military intervention in the governance of the country to
pursue industrial and agricultural growth and development of the interior.
Exploiting vast natural resources and a large labor pool, Brazil became
South America's leading economic power by the 1970s. Highly unequal
income distribution remains a pressing problem.

Geography Brazil

Location:  Eastern South America, bordering the Atlantic Ocean

Geographic coordinates:  10 00 S, 55 00 W

Climate:  mostly tropical, but temperate in south

Terrain:  mostly flat to rolling lowlands in north; some plains, hills,
mountains, and narrow coastal belt

Natural hazards:  recurring droughts in northeast; floods and occasional
frost in south

Environment - current issues:  deforestation in Amazon Basin destroys the
habitat and endangers a multitude of plant and animal species indigenous
to the area; there is a lucrative illegal wildlife trade; air and water
pollution in Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, and several other large cities;
land degradation and water pollution caused by improper mining activities;
wetland degradation; severe oil spills

Economy Brazil

Economy - overview:  Possessing large and well-developed agricultural,
mining, manufacturing, and service sectors, Brazil's economy outweighs
that of all other South American countries and is expanding its presence
in world markets.  The maintenance of large current account deficits via
capital account surpluses became problematic as investors became more risk
averse to emerging market exposure as a consequence of the Asian financial
crisis in 1997 and the Russian bond default in August 1998. After crafting
a fiscal adjustment program and pledging progress on structural reform,
Brazil received a $41.5 billion IMF-led international support program in
November 1998. In January 1999, the Brazilian Central Bank announced that
the real would no longer be pegged to the US dollar. This devaluation
helped moderate the downturn in economic growth in 1999 that investors
had expressed concerns about over the summer of 1998, and the country
posted moderate GDP growth. Economic growth slowed considerably in 2001
- to less than 2% - because of a slowdown in major markets and the
hiking of interest rates by the Central Bank to combat inflationary
pressures. Investor confidence was strong at yearend 2001, in part
because of the strong recovery in the trade balance.

Bhutan

Introduction

Bhutan

Background:  In 1865, Britain and Bhutan signed the Treaty of Sinchulu,
under which Bhutan would receive an annual subsidy in exchange for ceding
some border land.  Under British influence, a monarchy was set up in 1907;
three years later, a treaty was signed whereby the British agreed not to
interfere in Bhutanese internal affairs and Bhutan allowed Britain to
direct its foreign affairs. This role was assumed by independent India
after 1947. Two years later, a formal Indo-Bhutanese accord returned the
areas of Bhutan annexed by the British, formalized the annual subsidies
the country received, and defined India's responsibilities in defense
and foreign relations. A refugee issue of some 100,000 Bhutanese in
Nepal remains unresolved; 90% of the refugees are housed in seven United
Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) camps. Maoist
Assamese separatists from India, who have established themselves in the
southeast portion of Bhutan, have drawn Indian cross-border incursions.

Economy Bhutan

Economy - overview:  The economy, one of the world's smallest and
least developed, is based on agriculture and forestry, providing
the main livelihood for more than 90% of the population. Agriculture
consists largely of subsistence farming and animal husbandry. Rugged
mountains dominate the terrain and make the building of roads and other
infrastructure difficult and expensive. The economy is closely aligned
with India's through strong trade and monetary links. The industrial
sector is technologically backward, with most production of the cottage
industry type. Most development projects, such as road construction, rely
on Indian migrant labor. Bhutan's hydropower potential and its attraction
for tourists are key resources. The Bhutanese Government has made some
progress in expanding the nation's productive base and improving social
welfare. Model education, social, and environment programs in Bhutan are
underway with support from multilateral development organizations. Each
economic program takes into account the government's desire to protect
the country's environment and cultural traditions. Detailed controls
and uncertain policies in areas like industrial licensing, trade, labor,
and finance continue to hamper foreign investment.  Major hydroelectric
projects will lead expansion of GDP in 2002 by an estimated 6%.

Bulgaria

Introduction

Bulgaria

Background:  The Bulgars, a Central Asian Turkic tribe, merged with
the local Slavic inhabitants in the late 7th century to form the first
Bulgarian state. In succeeding centuries, Bulgaria struggled with the
Byzantine Empire to assert its place in the Balkans, but by the end of
the 14th century the country was overrun by the Ottoman Turks.  Bulgaria
regained its independence in 1878, but having fought on the losing side
in both World Wars, it fell within the Soviet sphere of influence and
became a People's Republic in 1946.  Communist domination ended in 1990,
when Bulgaria held its first multiparty election since World War II and
began the contentious process of moving toward political democracy and
a market economy while combating inflation, unemployment, corruption,
and crime.  Today, reforms and democratization keep Bulgaria on a path
toward eventual integration into NATO and the EU - with which it began
accession negotiations in 2000.

Bouvet Island

Introduction

Bouvet Island

Background:  This uninhabited volcanic island is almost entirely covered
by glaciers and is difficult to approach. It was discovered in 1739 by a
French naval officer after whom the island was named. No claim was made
until 1825 when the British flag was raised. In 1928, the UK waived its
claim in favor of Norway, which had occupied the island the previous
year. In 1971, Bouvet Island and the adjacent territorial waters were
designated a nature reserve. Since 1977, Norway has run an automated
meteorological station on the island.

Brunei

Introduction

Brunei

Background:  The Sultanate of Brunei's heyday occurred between the
15th and 17th centuries, when its control extended over coastal areas
of northwest Borneo and the southern Philippines. Brunei subsequently
entered a period of decline brought on by internal strife over royal
succession, colonial expansion of European powers, and piracy. In 1888,
Brunei became a British protectorate; independence was achieved in 1984.
Brunei benefits from extensive petroleum and natural gas fields, the
source of one of the highest per capita GDPs in the less developed
countries. The same family has now ruled Brunei for over six centuries.

Economy Brunei

Economy - overview:  This small, wealthy economy is a mixture of foreign
and domestic entrepreneurship, government regulation, welfare measures,
and village tradition.  Crude oil and natural gas production account for
nearly half of GDP. Per capita GDP is far above most other Third World
countries, and substantial income from overseas investment supplements
income from domestic production. The government provides for all medical
services and subsidizes rice and housing. Brunei's leaders are concerned
that steadily increased integration in the world economy will undermine
internal social cohesion although it became a more prominent player by
serving as chairman for the 2000 APEC (Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation)
forum. Plans for the future include upgrading the labor force, reducing
unemployment, strengthening the banking and tourist sectors, and, in
general, further widening the economic base beyond oil and gas.

Burundi

Introduction

Burundi

Background:  Burundi's first democratically elected president was
assassinated in October 1993 after only four months in office. Since
then, some 200,000 Burundians have perished in widespread, often
intense ethnic violence between Hutu and Tutsi factions. Hundreds
of thousands have been internally displaced or have become refugees
in neighboring countries. Burundian troops, seeking to secure their
borders, intervened in the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo in 1998. More recently, many of these troops have been redeployed
back to Burundi to deal with periodic upsurges in rebel activity. A new
transitional government, inaugurated on 1 November 2001, was to be the
first step towards holding national elections in three years. However,
the unwillingness of the Hutu rebels to enact a cease fire with Bujumbura
continues to obstruct prospects for a sustainable peace.

Economy Burundi

Economy - overview:  Burundi is a landlocked, resource-poor country with
an underdeveloped manufacturing sector. The economy is predominantly
agricultural with roughly 90% of the population dependent on subsistence
agriculture. Its economic health depends on the coffee crop, which
accounts for 80% of foreign exchange earnings. The ability to pay for
imports therefore rests largely on the vagaries of the climate and
the international coffee market. Since October 1993 the nation has
suffered from massive ethnic-based violence which has resulted in the
death of more than 200,000 persons and the displacement of about 800,000
others. Only one in four children go to school, and more than one in ten
adults has HIV/AIDS. Foods, medicines, and electricity remain in short
supply. Doubts regarding the sustainability of peace continue to impede
development. A Geneva donors' conference in November 2001 brought $800
million in pledges, and an IMF-staff-monitored program could lead to a
further agreement in 2002.

Canada

Introduction

Canada

Background:  A land of vast distances and rich natural resources,
Canada became a self-governing dominion in 1867 while retaining ties
to the British crown. Economically and technologically the nation has
developed in parallel with the US, its neighbor to the south across an
unfortified border. Its paramount political problem continues to be
the relationship of the province of Quebec, with its French-speaking
residents and unique culture, to the remainder of the country.

Geography Canada

Location:  Northern North America, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean
on the east, North Pacific Ocean on the west, and the Arctic Ocean on
the north, north of the conterminous US

result of the mixing of air masses from the Arctic, Pacific, and North
American interior, and produce most of the country's rain and snow east
of the mountains

Environment - current issues:  air pollution and resulting acid
rain severely affecting lakes and damaging forests; metal smelting,
coal-burning utilities, and vehicle emissions impacting on agricultural
and forest productivity; ocean waters becoming contaminated due to
agricultural, industrial, mining, and forestry activities

Economy Canada

Economy - overview:  As an affluent, high-tech industrial society,
Canada today closely resembles the US in its market-oriented economic
system, pattern of production, and high living standards. Since World
War II, the impressive growth of the manufacturing, mining, and service
sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural economy into
one primarily industrial and urban. The 1989 US-Canada Free Trade
Agreement (FTA) and 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)
(which includes Mexico) touched off a dramatic increase in trade and
economic integration with the US. As a result of the close cross-border
relationship, the economic downturn in the United States in 2001
had a negative impact on the Canadian economy. Real growth averaged
nearly 3% during 1993-2000, but declined in 2001. Unemployment is up,
with contraction in the manufacturing and natural resource sectors.
Nevertheless, with its great natural resources, skilled labor force,
and modern capital plant Canada enjoys solid economic prospects. Two
shadows loom, the first being the continuing constitutional impasse
between English- and French-speaking areas, which has been raising the
possibility of a split in the federation. Another long-term concern is the
flow south to the US of professionals lured by higher pay, lower taxes,
and the immense high-tech infrastructure.

Cambodia

Introduction

Cambodia

Background:  Following a five-year struggle, Communist Khmer Rouge
forces captured Phnom Penh in 1975 and ordered the evacuation of all
cities and towns; over 1 million displaced people died from execution
or enforced hardships. A 1978 Vietnamese invasion drove the Khmer Rouge
into the countryside and touched off 13 years of fighting. UN-sponsored
elections in 1993 helped restore some semblance of normalcy, as did the
rapid diminishment of the Khmer Rouge in the mid-1990s. A coalition
government, formed after national elections in 1998, brought renewed
political stability and the surrender of remaining Khmer Rouge forces.

Geography Cambodia

Irrigated land:  2,700 sq km (1998 est.)

Natural hazards:  monsoonal rains (June to November); flooding;
occasional droughts

Environment - current issues:  illegal logging activities throughout the
country and strip mining for gems in the western region along the border
with Thailand have resulted in habitat loss and declining biodiversity (in
particular, destruction of mangrove swamps threatens natural fisheries);
soil erosion; in rural areas, a majority of the population does not have
access to potable water; toxic waste delivery from Taiwan sparked unrest
in Kampong Saom (Sihanoukville) in December 1998

Environment - international agreements:  party to: Biodiversity, Climate

Economy Cambodia

Economy - overview:  Cambodia's economy slowed dramatically in 1997-98
due to the regional economic crisis, civil violence, and political
infighting. Foreign investment and tourism fell off. In 1999, the first
full year of peace in 30 years, progress was made on economic reforms and
growth resumed at 5%. GDP growth for 2000 had been projected to reach
5.5%, but the worst flooding in 70 years severely damaged agricultural
crops, and high oil prices hurt industrial production, and growth for the
year is estimated at only 4%. In 2001, severe floods damaged an estimated
15% of the area devoted to rice. Tourism now is Cambodia's fastest growing
industry, with arrivals up 34% in 2000 and up another 40% in 2001 before
the September 11 terrorist attacks in the US. The long-term development
of the economy after decades of war remains a daunting challenge. The
population lacks education and productive skills, particularly in the
poverty-ridden countryside, which suffers from an almost total lack of
basic infrastructure. Fear of renewed political instability and corruption
within the government discourage foreign investment and delay foreign
aid. On the brighter side, the government is addressing these issues
with assistance from bilateral and multilateral donors.

Chad

Introduction

Chad

Background:  Chad, part of France's African holdings until 1960, endured
three decades of ethnic warfare as well as invasions by Libya before
a semblance of peace was finally restored in 1990. The government
eventually suppressed or came to terms with most political-military
groups, settled a territorial dispute with Libya on terms favorable to
Chad, drafted a democratic constitution, and held multiparty presidential
and National Assembly elections in 1996 and 1997 respectively. In 1998
a new rebellion broke out in northern Chad, which continued to escalate
throughout 2000. A peace agreement, signed in January 2002 between the
government and the rebels, provides for the demobilization of the rebels
and their reintegration into the political system. Despite movement
toward democratic reform, power remains in the hands of a northern
ethnic oligarchy.

Economy Chad

Economy - overview:  Chad's primarily agricultural economy will be boosted
by major oilfield and pipeline projects that began in 2000. Over 80% of
Chad's population relies on subsistence farming and stock raising for
their livelihood.  Cotton, cattle, and gum arabic provide the bulk of
Chad's export earnings, but Chad will begin to export oil in 2004. Chad's
economy has long been handicapped by its land-locked position, high energy
costs, and a history of instability. Chad relies on foreign assistance and
foreign capital for most public and private sector investment projects. A
consortium led by two US companies is investing $3.7 billion to develop
oil reserves estimated at 1 billion barrels in southern Chad.

Sri Lanka

Introduction Sri Lanka

Background:  Occupied by the Portuguese in the 16th century and the
Dutch in the 17th century, the island was ceded to the British in
1802. As Ceylon it became independent in 1948; its name was changed
in 1972. Tensions between the Sinhalese majority and Tamil separatists
erupted in violence in the mid-1980s. Tens of thousands have died in an
ethnic war that continues to fester.

Economy Sri Lanka

Economy - overview:  In 1977, Colombo abandoned statist economic policies
and its import substitution trade policy for market-oriented policies
and export-oriented trade. Sri Lanka's most dynamic sectors now are food
processing, textiles and apparel, food and beverages, telecommunications,
and insurance and banking. By 1996 plantation crops made up only 20% of
exports (compared with 93% in 1970), while textiles and garments accounted
for 63%. GDP grew at an average annual rate of 5.5% throughout the 1990s
until a drought and a deteriorating security situation lowered growth
to 3.8% in 1996. The economy rebounded in 1997-2000 with average growth
of 5.3%. But 2001 saw the first contraction in the country's history,
due to a combination of power shortages, severe budgetary problems,
the global slowdown, and continuing civil strife.

Economy Congo, Republic of the

Economy - overview:  The economy is a mixture of village agriculture and
handicrafts, an industrial sector based largely on oil, support services,
and a government characterized by budget problems and overstaffing. Oil
has supplanted forestry as the mainstay of the economy, providing a
major share of government revenues and exports. In the early 1980s,
rapidly rising oil revenues enabled the government to finance large-scale
development projects with GDP growth averaging 5% annually, one of the
highest rates in Africa. The government has mortgaged a substantial
portion of its oil earnings, contributing to a shortage of revenues. The
12 January 1994 devaluation of Franc Zone currencies by 50% resulted
in inflation of 61% in 1994, but inflation has subsided since. Economic
reform efforts continued with the support of international organizations,
notably the World Bank and the IMF. The reform program came to a
halt in June 1997 when civil war erupted. Denis SASSOU-NGUESSO, who
returned to power when the war ended in October 1997, publicly expressed
interest in moving forward on economic reforms and privatization and
in renewing cooperation with international financial institutions.
However, economic progress was badly hurt by slumping oil prices and
the resumption of armed conflict in December 1998, which worsened the
republic's budget deficit. Given a fragile peace, agreements with the IMF
and the World Bank, and general international support for reconstruction
and development, prospects for structural reform and 4% growth in 2002-03

Congo, Democratic Republic of the

Introduction

Congo, Democratic Republic of the

Background:  Since 1997 the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DROC;
formerly called Zaire) has been rent by ethnic strife and civil war,
touched off by a massive inflow in 1994 of refugees from the fighting
in Rwanda and Burundi.  The government of former president MOBUTU Sese
Seko was toppled by a rebellion led by Laurent KABILA in May 1997;
his regime was subsequently challenged by a Rwanda- and Uganda-backed
rebellion in August 1998. Troops from Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia, Chad,
and Sudan intervened to support the Kinshasa regime. A cease-fire was
signed on 10 July 1999 by the DROC, Zimbabwe, Angola, Uganda, Namibia,
Rwanda, and Congolese armed rebel groups RCD-G and MLC, but sporadic
fighting continued. KABILA was assassinated on 16 January 2001 and his
son Joseph KABILA was named head of state on 26 January 2001. Despite
taking a radically different approach than his father, the new president
has been equally unsuccessful in ending the war.

875,000 refugees to return to Rwanda in late 1996 and early 1997 and
additional refugees have returned in subsequent years; fighting between
the Congolese government and Uganda- and Rwanda-backed Congolese rebels
spawned a regional war in DROC in August 1998, which left 1.8 million
Congolese displaced in DROC and caused 300,000 Congolese refugees to
flee to surrounding countries (2002 est.)

Economy Congo, Democratic Republic of the

Economy - overview:  The economy of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo - a nation endowed with vast potential wealth - has declined
drastically since the mid-1980s.  The war, which began in August 1998,
has dramatically reduced national output and government revenue and has
increased external debt. Foreign businesses have curtailed operations due
to uncertainty about the outcome of the conflict, lack of infrastructure,
and the difficult operating environment. The war has intensified the
impact of such basic problems as an uncertain legal framework, corruption,
raging inflation, and lack of openness in government economic policy
and financial operations. A number of IMF and World Bank missions have
met with the government to help it develop a coherent economic plan,
and President KABILA has begun implementing reforms.

China

Introduction

China

Background:  For centuries China stood as a leading civilization,
outpacing the rest of the world in the arts and sciences. But in the
19th and early 20th centuries, China was beset by civil unrest, major
famines, military defeats, and foreign occupation. After World War II,
the Communists under MAO Zedong established a dictatorship that, while
ensuring China's sovereignty, imposed strict controls over everyday
life and cost the lives of tens of millions of people. After 1978, his
successor DENG Xiaoping gradually introduced market-oriented reforms
and decentralized economic decision making, and output quadrupled by
2000. Political controls remain tight even while economic controls
continue to be relaxed.

Economy China

Economy - overview:  In late 1978 the Chinese leadership began moving the
economy from a sluggish Soviet-style centrally planned economy to a more
market-oriented system. Whereas the system operates within a political
framework of strict Communist control, the economic influence of non-state
organizations and individual citizens has been steadily increasing.
The authorities have switched to a system of household and village
responsibility in agriculture in place of the old collectivization,
increased the authority of local officials and plant managers in industry,
permitted a wide variety of small-scale enterprise in services and
light manufacturing, and opened the economy to increased foreign trade
and investment. The result has been a quadrupling of GDP since 1978. In
2001, with its 1.27 billion people but a GDP of just $4,300 per capita,
China stood as the second largest economy in the world after the US
(measured on a purchasing power parity basis). Agriculture and industry
have posted major gains, especially in coastal areas near Hong Kong
and opposite Taiwan, where foreign investment has helped spur output of
both domestic and export goods. On the darker side, the leadership has
often experienced in its hybrid system the worst results of socialism
(bureaucracy and lassitude) and of capitalism (windfall gains and
growing income disparities). Beijing thus has periodically backtracked,
retightening central controls at intervals. The government has struggled
to (a) collect revenues due from provinces, businesses, and individuals;
(b) reduce corruption and other economic crimes; and (c) keep afloat
the large state-owned enterprises many of which had been shielded from
competition by subsidies and had been losing the ability to pay full
wages and pensions. From 80 to 120 million surplus rural workers are
adrift between the villages and the cities, many subsisting through
part-time low-paying jobs. Popular resistance, changes in central policy,
and loss of authority by rural cadres have weakened China's population
control program, which is essential to maintaining long-term growth in
living standards.  Another long-term threat to continued rapid economic
growth is the deterioration in the environment, notably air pollution,
soil erosion, and the steady fall of the water table especially in the
north. China continues to lose arable land because of erosion and economic
development. Beijing will intensify efforts to stimulate growth through
spending on infrastructure - such as water control and power grids -
and poverty relief and through rural tax reform aimed at eliminating
arbitrary local levies on farmers. Access to the World Trade Organization
strengthens China's ability to maintain sturdy growth rates, and at
the same time puts additional pressure on the hybrid system of strong
political controls and growing market influences. Although Beijing has
claimed 7%-8% annual growth in recent years, many observers believe the
rate, while strong, is more like 5%.

Economy Chile

Economy - overview:  Chile has a market-oriented economy characterized
by a high level of foreign trade. During the early 1990s, Chile's
reputation as a role model for economic reform was strengthened when
the democratic government of Patricio AYLWIN - which took over from
the military in 1990 - deepened the economic reform initiated by the
military government.  Growth in real GDP averaged 8% during 1991-97,
but fell to half that level in 1998 because of tight monetary policies
implemented to keep the current account deficit in check and because
of lower export earnings - the latter a product of the global financial
crisis. A severe drought exacerbated the recession in 1999, reducing crop
yields and causing hydroelectric shortfalls and electricity rationing,
and Chile experienced negative economic growth for the first time in more
than 15 years. Despite the effects of the recession, Chile maintained
its reputation for strong financial institutions and sound policy that
have given it the strongest sovereign bond rating in South America. By
the end of 1999, exports and economic activity had begun to recover,
and growth rebounded to 5.4% in 2000. Unemployment remains stubbornly
high, however, putting pressure on President LAGOS to improve living
standards. The Argentine financial meltdown has put pressure on the
Chilean peso and is slowing the country's economic growth.  Meanwhile,
Chile and the US are conducting negotiations for a free trade agreement.

Economy Cameroon

Economy - overview:  Because of its oil resources and favorable
agricultural conditions, Cameroon has one of the best-endowed primary
commodity economies in sub-Saharan Africa. Still, it faces many of
the serious problems facing other underdeveloped countries, such
as a top-heavy civil service and a generally unfavorable climate
for business enterprise. Since 1990, the government has embarked
on various IMF and World Bank programs designed to spur business
investment, increase efficiency in agriculture, improve trade, and
recapitalize the nation's banks. In June 2000, the government completed
an IMF-sponsored, three-year structural adjustment program; however, the
IMF is pressing for more reforms, including increased budget transparency
and privatization. International oil and cocoa prices have considerable
impact on the economy.

Economy Comoros

Economy - overview:  One of the world's poorest countries, Comoros is made
up of three islands that have inadequate transportation links, a young
and rapidly increasing population, and few natural resources. The low
educational level of the labor force contributes to a subsistence level
of economic activity, high unemployment, and a heavy dependence on foreign
grants and technical assistance. Agriculture, including fishing, hunting,
and forestry, contributes 40% to GDP, employs 80% of the labor force, and
provides most of the exports. The country is not self-sufficient in food
production; rice, the main staple, accounts for the bulk of imports. The
government is struggling to upgrade education and technical training,
to privatize commercial and industrial enterprises, to improve health
services, to diversify exports, to promote tourism, and to reduce the
high population growth rate. Increased foreign support is essential if
the goal of 4% annual GDP growth is to be met. Remittances from 150,000
Comorans abroad help supplement GDP.

Colombia

Introduction

Colombia

Background:  Colombia was one of the three countries that emerged from
the collapse of Gran Colombia in 1830 (the others being Ecuador and
Venezuela). A 40-year insurgent campaign to overthrow the Colombian
Government escalated during the 1990s, undergirded in part by funds
from the drug trade.  Although the violence is deadly and large swaths
of the countryside are under guerrilla influence, the movement lacks
the military strength or popular support necessary to overthrow the
government.  An anti-insurgent army of paramilitaries has grown to be
several thousand strong in recent years, challenging the insurgents for
control of territory and illicit industries such as the drug trade and
the government's ability to exert its dominion over rural areas. While
Bogota continues to try to negotiate a settlement, neighboring countries
worry about the violence spilling over their borders.

Economy Colombia

Economy - overview:  Colombia's economy suffered from weak domestic
demand, austere government budgets, and a difficult security situation. A
new president takes office in 2002 and will face economic challenges
ranging from pension reform to reduction of unemployment. Two of
Colombia's leading exports, oil and coffee, face an uncertain future; new
exploration is needed to offset declining oil production, while coffee
harvests and prices are depressed. Problems in public security are a
concern for Colombian business leaders, who are calling for progress in
the government's peace negotiations with insurgent groups. Colombia is
looking for continued support from the international community to boost
economic and peace prospects.

one-half million in recent years, but financial difficulties in Japan
have caused a temporary slowdown. The agricultural sector is made up of

Economy Costa Rica

Economy - overview:  Costa Rica's basically stable economy depends
on tourism, agriculture, and electronics exports. Poverty has been
substantially reduced over the past 15 years, and a strong social safety
net has been put into place. Foreign investors remain attracted by the
country's political stability and high education levels, and tourism
continues to bring in foreign exchange. However, traditional export
sectors have not kept pace. Low coffee prices and an overabundance of
bananas have hurt the agricultural sector. The government continues to
grapple with its large deficit and massive internal debt and with the need
to modernize the state-owned electricity and telecommunications sector.

Economy Central African Republic

Economy - overview:  Subsistence agriculture, together with forestry,
remains the backbone of the economy of the Central African Republic
(CAR), with more than 70% of the population living in outlying areas. The
agricultural sector generates half of GDP. Timber has accounted for
about 16% of export earnings and the diamond industry for 54%. Important
constraints to economic development include the CAR's landlocked position,
a poor transportation system, a largely unskilled work force, and a
legacy of misdirected macroeconomic policies. The 50% devaluation of
the currencies of 14 Francophone African nations on 12 January 1994 had
mixed effects on the CAR's economy. Diamond, timber, coffee, and cotton
exports increased, leading an estimated rise of GDP of 7% in 1994 and
nearly 5% in 1995. Military rebellions and social unrest in 1996 were
accompanied by widespread destruction of property and a drop in GDP of
2%. The IMF approved an Extended Structure Adjustment Facility in 1998
and the World Bank extended further credits in 1999 and approved a $10
million loan in early 2001. As of January 2002, many civil servants
were owed as much as 16 months pay during the PATASSE administration,
as well as 14 months pay from the KOLINGBA administration.

Cuba

Introduction

Cuba

Background:  Fidel CASTRO led a rebel army to victory in 1959; his iron
rule has held the country together since. Cuba's Communist revolution,
with Soviet support, was exported throughout Latin America and Africa
during the 1960s, 70s, and 80s. The country is now slowly recovering
from a severe economic recession in 1990, following the withdrawal of
former Soviet subsidies, worth $4 billion to $6 billion annually. Havana
portrays its difficulties as the result of the US embargo in place
since 1961. Illicit migration to the US - using homemade rafts, alien
smugglers, or falsified visas - is a continuing problem. Some 3,000
Cubans attempted the crossing of the Straits of Florida in 2001; the US
Coast Guard interdicted only about 25% of these.

Economy Cuba

Economy - overview:  The government continues to balance the need for
economic loosening against a concern for firm political control. It has
undertaken limited reforms in recent years to stem excess liquidity,
increase enterprise efficiency, and alleviate serious shortages of
food, consumer goods, and services, but is unlikely to implement
extensive changes. A major feature of the economy is the dichotomy
between relatively efficient export enclaves and inefficient domestic
sectors. The average Cuban's standard of living remains at a lower level
than before the severe economic depression of the early 1990s, which
was caused by the loss of Soviet aid and domestic inefficiencies. High
oil prices, recessions in key export markets, and damage from Hurricane
Michelle hampered growth in 2001. Cuba paid high prices for oil imports
in the face of slumping prices in the key sugar and nickel industries
and suffered a slowdown in tourist arrivals following September 11. The
government subsequently depreciated the peso by approximately 30% and
now aims for 3% growth in 2002.

in 2001 was only 11%, of which fishing accounts for 1.5%. About 82% of
food must be imported. The fishing potential, mostly lobster and tuna,
is not fully exploited. Cape Verde annually runs a high trade deficit,
financed by foreign aid and remittances from emigrants; remittances
supplement GDP by more than 20%. Economic reforms, launched by the new
democratic government in 1991, are aimed at developing the private sector
and attracting foreign investment to diversify the economy. Prospects
for 2002 depend heavily on the maintenance of aid flows, remittances,
and the momentum of the government's development program.

islands became a British protectorate in 1888. By 1900, administrative
control was transferred to New Zealand; in 1965 residents chose
self-government in free association with New Zealand. The emigration of
skilled workers to New Zealand and government deficits are continuing
problems.

Economy Cook Islands

Economy - overview:  Like many other South Pacific island nations,
the Cook Islands' economic development is hindered by the isolation of
the country from foreign markets, the limited size of domestic markets,
lack of natural resources, periodic devastation from natural disasters,
and inadequate infrastructure. Agriculture provides the economic base with
major exports made up of copra and citrus fruit. Manufacturing activities
are limited to fruit processing, clothing, and handicrafts. Trade
deficits are offset by remittances from emigrants and by foreign aid,
overwhelmingly from New Zealand. In the 1980s and 1990s, the country lived
beyond its means, maintaining a bloated public service and accumulating
a large foreign debt. Subsequent reforms, including the sale of state
assets, the strengthening of economic management, the encouragement of
tourism, and a debt restructuring agreement, have rekindled investment
and growth.

Cyprus

Introduction

Cyprus

Background:  Independence from the UK was approved in 1960 with
constitutional guarantees by the Greek Cypriot majority to the Turkish
Cypriot minority. In 1974, a Greek-sponsored attempt to seize the
government was met by military intervention from Turkey, which soon
controlled almost 40% of the island. In 1983, the Turkish-held area
declared itself the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus", but it is
recognized only by Turkey.  UN-led talks on the status of Cyprus resumed
in December 1999 to prepare the ground for meaningful negotiations
leading to a comprehensive settlement.

Economy Cyprus

Economy - overview:  Economic affairs are affected by the division
of the country. The Greek Cypriot economy is prosperous but highly
susceptible to external shocks. Erratic growth rates in the 1990s
reflect the economy's vulnerability to swings in tourist arrivals,
caused by political instability in the region and fluctuations in
economic conditions in Western Europe.  Economic policy is focused on
meeting the criteria for admission to the EU. As in the Turkish sector,
water shortages are a perennial problem; a few desalination plants
are now online. The Turkish Cypriot economy has less than one-half the
per capita GDP of the south. Because it is recognized only by Turkey,
it has had much difficulty arranging foreign financing, and foreign
firms have hesitated to invest there. It remains heavily dependent on
agriculture and government service, which together employ about half of
the work force. To compensate for the economy's weakness, Turkey provides
substantial direct and indirect aid to tourism, education, industry, etc.

GDP:  Greek Cypriot area: purchasing power parity - $9.1 billion (2001

Economy Denmark

Economy - overview:  This thoroughly modern market economy features
high-tech agriculture, up-to-date small-scale and corporate industry,
extensive government welfare measures, comfortable living standards,
a stable currency, and high dependence on foreign trade. Denmark is
a net exporter of food and energy and has a comfortable balance of
payments surplus. The government has been successful in meeting, and
even exceeding, the economic convergence criteria for participating in
the third phase (a common European currency) of the European Monetary
Union (EMU), but Denmark, in a September 2000 referendum, reconfirmed
its decision not to join the 11 other EU members in the euro. Even so,
the Danish currency remains pegged to the euro.

Economy Djibouti

Economy - overview:  The economy is based on service activities connected
with the country's strategic location and status as a free trade zone in
northeast Africa.  Two-thirds of the inhabitants live in the capital
city, the remainder being mostly nomadic herders. Scanty rainfall
limits crop production to fruits and vegetables, and most food must
be imported. Djibouti provides services as both a transit port for the
region and an international transshipment and refueling center. It has
few natural resources and little industry. The nation is, therefore,
heavily dependent on foreign assistance to help support its balance of
payments and to finance development projects. An unemployment rate of 50%
continues to be a major problem. Inflation is not a concern, however,
because of the fixed tie of the franc to the US dollar. Per capita
consumption dropped an estimated 35% over the last seven years because
of recession, civil war, and a high population growth rate (including
immigrants and refugees). Faced with a multitude of economic difficulties,
the government has fallen in arrears on long-term external debt and has
been struggling to meet the stipulations of foreign aid donors. Another
factor limiting growth is the negative impact on port activity now that
Ethiopia has more trade route options.

Dominica

Introduction

Dominica

Background:  Dominica was the last of the Caribbean islands to be
colonized by Europeans, due chiefly to the fierce resistance of the
native Caribs. France ceded possession to Great Britain in 1763, which
made the island a colony in 1805. In 1980, two years after independence,
Dominica's fortunes improved when a corrupt and tyrannical administration
was replaced by that of Mary Eugenia CHARLES, the first female prime
minister in the Caribbean, who remained in office for 15 years.

Economy Dominica

Economy - overview:  The Dominican economy depends on agriculture,
primarily bananas, and remains highly vulnerable to climatic
conditions. Hurricane Luis devastated the country's banana crop in
1995 after tropical storms wiped out a quarter of the 1994 crop. The
subsequent recovery has been fueled by increases in construction, soap
production, and tourist arrivals. Development of the tourism industry
remains difficult however, because of the rugged coastline, lack of
beaches, and the absence of an international airport. Economic growth is
sluggish, and unemployment is greater than 20%. The government has been
attempting to develop an offshore financial sector in order to diversify
the island's production base.

Introduction

Jarvis Island

Background:  First discovered by the British in 1821, the uninhabited
island was annexed by the US in 1858, but abandoned in 1879 after tons
of guano had been removed. The UK annexed the island in 1889, but never
carried out plans for further exploitation. The US occupied and reclaimed
the island in 1935. Abandoned after World War II, the island is currently
a National Wildlife Refuge administered by the US Department of the

Economy Dominican Republic

Economy - overview:  The Dominican economy experienced dramatic growth
over the last decade, even though the economy was hit hard by Hurricane
Georges in 1998.  Although the country has long been viewed primarily as
an exporter of sugar, coffee, and tobacco, in recent years the service
sector has overtaken agriculture as the economy's largest employer,
due to growth in tourism and free trade zones. The country suffers from
marked income inequality; the poorest half of the population receives
less than one-fifth of GNP, while the richest 10% enjoy 40% of national
income. A US $500 million foreign bond issue in September 2001 will
contribute to increased public investment spending.

Economy Ecuador

Economy - overview:  Ecuador has substantial oil resources and rich
agricultural areas. Because the country exports primary products such
as oil, bananas, and shrimp, fluctuations in world market prices can
have a substantial domestic impact. Ecuador joined the World Trade
Organization in 1996, but has failed to comply with many of its accession
commitments. The aftermath of El Nino and depressed oil market of 1997-98
drove Ecuador's economy into a free-fall in 1999. The beginning of 1999
saw the banking sector collapse, which helped precipitate an unprecedented
default on external loans later that year. Continued economic instability
drove a 70% depreciation of the currency throughout 1999, which forced
a desperate government to "dollarize" the currency regime in 2000. The
move stabilized the currency, but did not stave off the ouster of the
government. Gustavo NOBOA, who assumed the presidency in January 2000,
has managed to pass substantial economic reforms and mend relations
with international financial institutions. Ecuador completed its first
standby agreement since 1986 when the IMF Board approved a 10 December
2001 disbursement of $96 million, the final installment of a $300 million
standby credit agreement.

Egypt

Introduction

Egypt

Background:  Nominally independent from the UK in 1922, Egypt acquired
full sovereignty following World War II. The completion of the Aswan High
Dam in 1971 and the resultant Lake Nasser have altered the time-honored
place of the Nile river in the agriculture and ecology of Egypt. A
rapidly growing population (the largest in the Arab world), limited arable
land, and dependence on the Nile all continue to overtax resources and
stress society. The government has struggled to ready the economy for
the new millennium through economic reform and massive investment in
communications and physical infrastructure.

Economy Egypt

Economy - overview:  Egypt improved its macroeconomic performance
throughout most of the last decade by following IMF advice on fiscal,
monetary, and structural reform policies. As a result, Cairo managed
to tame inflation, slash budget deficits, and attract more foreign
investment. In the past three years, however, the pace of reform has
slackened, and excessive spending on national infrastructure projects
has widened budget deficits again. Lower foreign exchange earnings since
1998 resulted in pressure on the Egyptian pound and periodic dollar
shortages. Monetary pressures have increased since 11 September 2001
because of declines in tourism, Suez canal tolls, and exports, and Cairo
has devalued the pound several times in the past year.  The development
of a gas export market is a major bright spot for future growth prospects.

British Commonwealth; it joined the European Community in 1973. Irish

Economy Ireland

Economy - overview:  Ireland is a small, modern, trade-dependent economy
with growth averaging a robust 9% in 1995-2001. Agriculture, once the
most important sector, is now dwarfed by industry, which accounts
for 38% of GDP, about 80% of exports, and employs 28% of the labor
force. Although exports remain the primary engine for Ireland's robust
growth, the economy is also benefiting from a rise in consumer spending
and recovery in both construction and business investment. Over the past
decade, the Irish government has implemented a series of national economic
programs designed to curb inflation, reduce government spending, increase
labor force skills, and promote foreign investment.  Ireland joined in
launching the euro currency system in January 1999 along with 10 other
EU nations. The economy felt the impact of the global economic slowdown
in 2001, particularly in the high-tech export sector; the growth rate was
cut by nearly half. Growth in 2002 is expected to fall in the 3%-5% range.

Economy Equatorial Guinea

Economy - overview:  The discovery and exploitation of large oil reserves
have contributed to dramatic economic growth in recent years. Forestry,
farming, and fishing are also major components of GDP. Subsistence
farming predominates.  Although pre-independence Equatorial Guinea
counted on cocoa production for hard currency earnings, the neglect
of the rural economy under successive regimes has diminished potential
for agriculture-led growth (the government has stated its intention to
reinvest some oil revenue into agriculture). A number of aid programs
sponsored by the World Bank and the IMF have been cut off since
1993 because of corruption and mismanagement. No longer eligible for
concessional financing because of large oil revenues, the government
has been unsuccessfully trying to agree on a "shadow" fiscal management
program with the World Bank and IMF.  Businesses, for the most part,
are owned by government officials and their family members. Undeveloped
natural resources include titanium, iron ore, manganese, uranium, and
alluvial gold. Boosts in production and higher world oil prices stimulated
growth in 2002, with oil accounting for 90% of increased exports.

Eritrea

Introduction

Eritrea

Background:  Eritrea was awarded to Ethiopia in 1952 as part of a
federation. Ethiopia's annexation of Eritrea as a province 10 years
later sparked a 30-year struggle for independence that ended in 1991
with Eritrean rebels defeating governmental forces; independence was
overwhelmingly approved in a 1993 referendum. A two and a half year
border war with Ethiopia that erupted in 1998 ended under UN auspices on
12 December 2000.  Eritrea currently hosts a UN peacekeeping operation
that will monitor the border region until an international commission
determines and demarcates the boundary between the two countries.

Economy Eritrea

Economy - overview:  Since independence from Ethiopia on 24 May 1993,
Eritrea has faced the economic problems of a small, desperately poor
country. Like the economies of many African nations, the economy is
largely based on subsistence agriculture, with 80% of the population
involved in farming and herding. The Ethiopian-Eritrea war in 1998-2000
severely hurt Eritrea's economy. GDP growth in 1999 fell to less than 1%,
and GDP decreased by 8.2% in 2000. The May 2000 Ethiopian offensive into
northern Eritrea caused some $600 million in property damage and loss,
including losses of $225 million in livestock and 55,000 homes. The attack
prevented planting of crops in Eritrea's most productive region, causing
food production to drop by 62%. Even during the war, Eritrea developed
its transportation infrastructure, asphalting new roads, improving its
ports, and repairing war damaged roads and bridges. Eritrea's economic
future remains mixed. The cessation of Ethiopian trade, which mainly used
Eritrean ports before the war, leaves Eritrea with a large economic hole
to fill. Eritrea's economic future depends upon its ability to master
fundamental social problems like illiteracy, unemployment, and low skills,
and to convert the diaspora's money and expertise into economic growth.

Economy El Salvador

Economy - overview:  El Salvador is a struggling Central American
economy which has been suffering from a weak tax collection system,
factory closings, the aftermaths of Hurricane Mitch of 1998 and the
devastating earthquakes of early 2001, and weak world coffee prices. On
the bright side, in recent years inflation has fallen to single digit
levels, and total exports have grown substantially. The trade deficit
has been offset by remittances (an estimated $1.6 billion in 2000) from
Salvadorans living abroad and by external aid. As of 1 January 2001,
the US dollar was made legal tender alongside the colon. Growth in 2002
will depend largely on the speed of recovery in the US.

Ethiopia

Introduction

Ethiopia

Background:  Unique among African countries, the ancient Ethiopian
monarchy maintained its freedom from colonial rule, one exception being
the Italian occupation of 1936-41. In 1974 a military junta, the Derg,
deposed Emperor Haile SELASSIE (who had ruled since 1930) and established
a socialist state. Torn by bloody coups, uprisings, wide-scale drought,
and massive refugee problems, the regime was finally toppled by a
coalition of rebel forces, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic
Front (EPRDF), in 1991. A constitution was adopted in 1994 and Ethiopia's
first multiparty elections were held in 1995. A two and a half year
border war with Eritrea ended with a peace treaty on 12 December 2000.

Economy Ethiopia

Economy - overview:  Ethiopia's poverty-stricken economy is based on
agriculture, which accounts for half of GDP, 85% of exports, and 80% of
total employment. The agricultural sector suffers from frequent drought
and poor cultivation practices, and as many as 4.6 million people need
food assistance annually. Coffee is critical to the Ethiopian economy with
exports of some $260 million in 2000. Other important exports include
qat, live animals, hides, and gold. The war with Eritrea in 1999-2000
and recurrent drought have buffeted the economy, in particular coffee
production. In November 2001 Ethiopia qualified for debt relief from the
Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. Under Ethiopia's land
tenure system, the government owns all land and provides long-term leases
to the tenants; the system continues to hamper growth in the industrial
sector as entrepreneurs are unable to use land as collateral for loans.
Despite this limitation, strong growth is expected to continue in the
near term as good rainfall, the cessation of hostilities, and renewed
foreign aid and debt relief push the economy forward.

Czech Republic

Introduction Czech Republic

Background:  After World War II, Czechoslovakia fell within the Soviet
sphere of influence. In 1968, an invasion by Warsaw Pact troops ended
the efforts of the country's leaders to liberalize party rule and create
"socialism with a human face." Anti-Soviet demonstrations the following
year ushered in a period of harsh repression. With the collapse of
Soviet authority in 1989, Czechoslovakia regained its freedom through a
peaceful "Velvet Revolution." On 1 January 1993, the country underwent a
"velvet divorce" into its two national components, the Czech Republic
and Slovakia. Now a member of NATO, the Czech Republic has moved toward
integration in world markets, a development that poses both opportunities
and risks.

Economy Czech Republic

Economy - overview:  Basically one of the most stable and prosperous of
the post-Communist states, the Czech Republic has been recovering from
recession since mid-1999. Growth in 2000-01 was led by exports to the
EU, especially Germany, and foreign investment, while domestic demand is
reviving.  Uncomfortably high fiscal and current account deficits could
be future problems. Unemployment is gradually declining as job creation
continues in the rebounding economy; inflation is up to 4.7% but still
moderate. The EU put the Czech Republic just behind Poland and Hungary in
preparations for accession, which will give further impetus and direction
to structural reform. Moves to complete banking, telecommunications, and
energy privatization will add to foreign investment, while intensified
restructuring among large enterprises and banks and improvements in the
financial sector should strengthen output growth.

Economy French Guiana

Economy - overview:  The economy is tied closely to the French economy
through subsidies and imports.  Besides the French space center at Kourou,
fishing and forestry are the most important economic activities. Forest
and woodland cover 90% of the country. The large reserves of tropical
hardwoods, not fully exploited, support an expanding sawmill industry
that provides sawn logs for export. Cultivation of crops is limited to
the coastal area, where the population is largely concentrated; rice
and manioc are the major crops. French Guiana is heavily dependent
on imports of food and energy. Unemployment is a serious problem,
particularly among younger workers.

Finland

Introduction

Finland

Background:  Ruled by Sweden from the 12th to the 19th centuries and by
Russia from 1809, Finland finally won its independence in 1917. During
World War II, it was able to successfully defend its freedom and fend off
invasions by the Soviet Union and Germany. In the subsequent half century,
the Finns have made a remarkable transformation from a farm/forest economy
to a diversified modern industrial economy; per capita income is now
on par with Western Europe. As a member of the European Union, Finland
was the only Nordic state to join the euro system at its initiation in
January 1999.

Economy Finland

Economy - overview:  Finland has a highly industrialized, largely
free-market economy, with per capita output roughly that of the UK,
France, Germany, and Italy. Its key economic sector is manufacturing
- principally the wood, metals, engineering, telecommunications,
and electronics industries. Trade is important, with exports equaling
almost one-third of GDP. Except for timber and several minerals, Finland
depends on imports of raw materials, energy, and some components for
manufactured goods.  Because of the climate, agricultural development
is limited to maintaining self-sufficiency in basic products. Forestry,
an important export earner, provides a secondary occupation for the
rural population. Rapidly increasing integration with Western Europe -
Finland was one of the 11 countries joining the euro monetary system
(EMU) on 1 January 1999 - will dominate the economic picture over the
next several years. Growth in 2001 was held back by the global slowdown
and will likely be anemic again in 2002.

Fiji

Introduction

Fiji

Background:  Fiji became independent in 1970, after nearly a century as
a British colony.  Democratic rule was interrupted by two military coups
in 1987, caused by concern over a government perceived as dominated by
the Indian community (descendants of contract laborers brought to the
islands by the British in the 19th century). A 1990 constitution favored
native Melanesian control of Fiji, but led to heavy Indian emigration;
the population loss resulted in economic difficulties, but ensured that
Melanesians became the majority. Amendments enacted in 1997 made the
constitution more equitable. Free and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted
in a government led by an Indo-Fijian, but a coup in May of 2000 ushered
in a prolonged period of political turmoil. Parliamentary elections held
in August 2001 provided Fiji with a democratically elected government
and gave a mandate to the government of Prime Minister Laisenia QARASE.

Economy Fiji

Economy - overview:  Fiji, endowed with forest, mineral, and fish
resources, is one of the most developed of the Pacific island economies,
though still with a large subsistence sector. Sugar exports and a growing
tourist industry - with 300,000 to 400,000 tourists annually - are the
major sources of foreign exchange. Sugar processing makes up one-third
of industrial activity. Long-term problems include low investment and
uncertain property rights. The political turmoil in Fiji has had a severe
impact with the economy shrinking by 2.8% in 2000 and growing by only 1%
in 2001. The Fiji Visitor's Bureau expects visitor arrivals to reach
pre-coup levels during 2002. The government's ability to manage its
budget - which is expected to run a net deficit of 6% in 2002 - will
depend upon a return of political stability and investor confidence.

Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas)

Introduction

Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas)

Background:  Although first sighted by an English navigator in 1592,
the first landing (English) did not occur until almost a century later
in 1690, and the first settlement (French) was not established until
1764. The colony was turned over to Spain two years later and the
islands have since been the subject of a territorial dispute, first
between Britain and Spain, then between Britain and Argentina. The UK
asserted its claim to the islands by establishing a naval garrison there
in 1833. Argentina invaded the islands on 2 April 1982. The British
responded with an expeditionary force that landed seven weeks later and
after fierce fighting forced Argentine surrender on 14 June 1982.

Economy Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas)

Economy - overview:  The economy was formerly based on agriculture,
mainly sheep farming, but today fishing contributes the bulk of economic
activity. In 1987 the government began selling fishing licenses to foreign
trawlers operating within the Falklands exclusive fishing zone. These
license fees total more than $40 million per year, which goes to support
the island's health, education, and welfare system. Squid accounts for
75% of the fish taken. Dairy farming supports domestic consumption;
crops furnish winter fodder. Exports feature shipments of high-grade
wool to the UK and the sale of postage stamps and coins. The islands
are now self-financing except for defense. The British Geological
Survey announced a 200-mile oil exploration zone around the islands in
1993, and early seismic surveys suggest substantial reserves capable of
producing 500,000 barrels per day; to date no exploitable site has been
identified. An agreement between Argentina and the UK in 1995 seeks to
defuse licensing and sovereignty conflicts that would dampen foreign
interest in exploiting potential oil reserves. Tourism is increasing
rapidly, with about 30,000 visitors in 2001. The second largest source
of income is interest paid on money the government has in the bank.
The British military presence also provides a sizeable economic boost.

industry exists, but the remote location and a lack of adequate facilities
hinder development. In 1996, the country experienced a 20% reduction in
revenues from the Compact of Free Association - the agreement with the
US in which Micronesia received $1.3 billion in financial and technical
assistance over a 15-year period until 2001. Since these revenues
accounted for 57% of consolidated government revenues, reduced Compact
funding resulted in a severe depression. Economic activity recovered in
1999-2001. The country's medium-term economic outlook appears fragile due
to likely further reductions in external grants made under the US Compact
funding. Geographical isolation and a poorly developed infrastructure
remain major impediments to long-term growth.

Economy Faroe Islands

Economy - overview:  The Faroese economy has had a strong performance
since 1994, mostly as a result of increasing fish landings and high and
stable export prices.  Unemployment is falling and there are signs of
labor shortages in several sectors. The positive economic development
has helped the Faroese Home Rule Government produce increasing budget
surpluses which in turn help to reduce the large public debt, most of
it owed to Denmark. However, the total dependence on fishing makes the
Faroese economy extremely vulnerable, and the present fishing efforts
appear in excess of what is a sustainable level of fishing in the long
term. Oil finds close to the Faroese area give hope for deposits in the
immediate Faroese area, which may eventually lay the basis for a more
diversified economy and thus lessen dependence on Denmark and Danish
economic assistance. Aided by a substantial annual subsidy (15% of GDP)
from Denmark, the Faroese have a standard of living not far below the
Danes and other Scandinavians.

Economy French Polynesia

Economy - overview:  Since 1962, when France stationed military personnel
in the region, French Polynesia has changed from a subsistence economy to
one in which a high proportion of the work force is either employed by
the military or supports the tourist industry. With the halt of French
nuclear testing in 1996, the military contribution to the economy fell
sharply. Tourism accounts for about one-fourth of GDP and is a primary
source of hard currency earnings. Other sources of income are pearl
farming and deep-sea commercial fishing. The small manufacturing sector
primarily processes agricultural products. The territory substantially
benefits from development agreements with France aimed principally at
creating new businesses and strengthening social services.

Baker Island

Introduction Baker Island

Background:  The US took possession of the island in 1857, and its guano
deposits were mined by US and British companies during the second half
of the 19th century. In 1935, a short-lived attempt at colonization was
begun on this island - as well as on nearby Howland Island - but was
disrupted by World War II and thereafter abandoned. Presently the island
is a National Wildlife Refuge run by the US Department of the Interior;
a day beacon is situated near the middle of the west coast.

Introduction

France

Background:  Although ultimately a victor in World Wars I and II, France
suffered extensive losses in its empire, wealth, manpower, and rank as
a dominant nation-state. Nevertheless, France today is one of the most
modern countries in the world and is a leader among European nations.
Since 1958, it has constructed a presidential democracy resistant to the
instabilities experienced in earlier parliamentary democracies. In recent
years, its reconciliation and cooperation with Germany have proved central
to the economic integration of Europe, including the advent of the euro
in January 1999.  Presently, France is at the forefront of European states
seeking to exploit the momentum of monetary union to advance the creation
of a more unified and capable European defense and security apparatus.

Economy France

Economy - overview:  France is in the midst of transition, from a
well-to-do modern economy that featured extensive government ownership
and intervention to one that relies more on market mechanisms. The
Socialist-led government has partially or fully privatized many large
companies, banks, and insurers, but still retains large stakes in
several leading firms, including Air France, France Telecom, Renault,
and Thales, and remains dominant in some sectors, particularly power,
public transport, and defense industries. The telecommunications sector is
gradually being opened to competition. France's leaders remain committed
to a capitalism in which they maintain social equity by means of laws,
tax policies, and social spending that reduce income disparity and
the impact of free markets on public health and welfare. The current
government has lowered income taxes and introduced measures to boost
employment, but has done little to reform an overly expensive pension
system, rigid labor market, and restrictive bureaucracy that discourage
hiring and make the tax burden one of the highest in Europe. In addition
to the tax burden, the reduction of the workweek to 35 hours, which is to
be extended to small firms in 2002, has drawn criticism for lowering the
competitiveness of French businesses. The current economic slowdown has
thrown the government's goal of balancing the budget by 2004 off track.

Introduction

Gambia, The

Background:  The Gambia gained its independence from the UK in 1965; it
formed a short-lived federation of Senegambia with Senegal between 1982
and 1989. In 1991 the two nations signed a friendship and cooperation
treaty. A military coup in 1994 overthrew the president and banned
political activity, but a new 1996 constitution and presidential
elections, followed by parliamentary balloting in 1997, completed a
nominal return to civilian rule. The country undertook another round of
presidential and legislative elections in late 2001 and early 2002.

Economy Gambia, The

Economy - overview:  The Gambia has no important mineral or other
natural resources and has a limited agricultural base. About 75% of the
population depends on crops and livestock for its livelihood. Small-scale
manufacturing activity features the processing of peanuts, fish, and
hides. Reexport trade normally constitutes a major segment of economic
activity, but a 1999 government-imposed preshipment inspection plan,
and instability of the Gambian dalasi (currency) have drawn some of
the reexport trade away from Banjul. The government's 1998 seizure
of the private peanut firm Alimenta eliminated the largest purchaser
of Gambian groundnuts; the following two marketing seasons have seen
substantially lower prices and sales. A decline in tourism in 2000
has also held back growth. Unemployment and underemployment rates are
extremely high. Shortrun economic progress remains highly dependent
on sustained bilateral and multilateral aid, on responsible government
economic management as forwarded by IMF technical help and advice, and
on expected growth in the construction sector. Record crops undergirded
sturdy growth in 2001.

Gabon

Introduction

Gabon

Background:  Ruled by autocratic presidents since independence from France
in 1960, Gabon introduced a multiparty system and a new constitution in
the early 1990s that allowed for a more transparent electoral process and
for reforms of governmental institutions. A small population, abundant
natural resources, and considerable foreign support have helped make
Gabon one of the more prosperous black African countries.

Economy Gabon

Economy - overview:  Gabon enjoys a per capita income four times that
of most nations of sub-Saharan Africa. This has supported a sharp
decline in extreme poverty; yet because of high income inequality a
large proportion of the population remains poor. Gabon depended on
timber and manganese until oil was discovered offshore in the early
1970s. The oil sector now accounts for 50% of GDP. Gabon continues to
face fluctuating prices for its oil, timber, and manganese exports.
Despite the abundance of natural wealth, the economy is hobbled by poor
fiscal management. In 1992, the fiscal deficit widened to 2.4% of GDP,
and Gabon failed to settle arrears on its bilateral debt, leading to
a cancellation of rescheduling agreements with official and private
creditors. Devaluation of its Francophone currency by 50% on 12 January
1994 sparked a one-time inflationary surge, to 35%; the rate dropped to
6% in 1996. The IMF provided a one-year standby arrangement in 1994-95,
a three-year Enhanced Financing Facility (EFF) at near commercial rates
beginning in late 1995, and stand-by credit of $119 million in October
2000. Those agreements mandate progress in privatization and fiscal
discipline. France provided additional financial support in January 1997
after Gabon had met IMF targets for mid-1996. In 1997, an IMF mission to
Gabon criticized the government for overspending on off-budget items,
overborrowing from the central bank, and slipping on its schedule for
privatization and administrative reform. The rebound of oil prices in
1999-2000 helped growth, but drops in production hampered Gabon from
fully realizing potential gains. In December 2000, Gabon signed a new
agreement with the Paris Club to reschedule its official debt. A follow-up
bilateral repayment agreement with the US was signed in December 2001.

Georgia

Introduction

Georgia

Background:  Georgia was absorbed into the Russian Empire in the 19th
century. Independent for three years (1918-1921) following the Russian
revolution, it was forcibly incorporated into the USSR until the Soviet
Union dissolved in 1991. Ethnic separation in Abkhazia and South Ossetia,
poor governance, and Russian military bases deny the government effective
control over the entirety of the state's internationally recognized
territory. Despite myriad problems, progress on market reforms and
democratization support the country's goal of greater integration with
Western political, economic and security institutions.

Economy Georgia

Economy - overview:  Georgia's main economic activities include
the cultivation of agricultural products such as citrus fruits, tea,
hazelnuts, and grapes; mining of manganese and copper; and output of a
small industrial sector producing alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages,
metals, machinery, and chemicals. The country imports the bulk of its
energy needs, including natural gas and oil products. Its only sizable
internal energy resource is hydropower. Despite the severe damage the
economy has suffered due to civil strife, Georgia, with the help of
the IMF and World Bank, has made substantial economic gains since 1995,
achieving positive GDP growth and curtailing inflation.  However, the
Georgian government suffers from limited resources due to a chronic
failure to collect tax revenues. Georgia also suffers from energy
shortages; it privatized the T'bilisi distribution network in 1998,
but collection rates are low, making the venture unprofitable. The
country is pinning its hopes for long-term recovery on its role as a
transit state for pipelines and trade.  The start of construction on
the Baku-T'bilisi-Ceyhan pipeline in summer 2002 will bring much-needed
investment and job opportunities to the country.

Ghana

Introduction

Ghana

Background:  Formed from the merger of the British colony of the
Gold Coast and the Togoland trust territory, Ghana in 1957 became
the first country in colonial Africa to gain its independence. A long
series of coups resulted in the suspension of the constitution in 1981
and the banning of political parties. A new constitution, restoring
multiparty politics, was approved in 1992. Lt. Jerry RAWLINGS, head
of state since 1981, won presidential elections in 1992 and 1996, but
was constitutionally prevented from running for a third term in 2000.

Economy Ghana

Economy - overview:  Well endowed with natural resources, Ghana has
roughly twice the per capita output of the poorer countries in West
Africa. Even so, Ghana remains heavily dependent on international
financial and technical assistance.  Gold, timber, and cocoa production
are major sources of foreign exchange. The domestic economy continues
to revolve around subsistence agriculture, which accounts for 36% of GDP
and employs 60% of the work force, mainly small landholders. Excessively
expansionary monetary and fiscal policy prior to the 2000 elections led
to accelerating inflation in early 2001. A depressed cocoa market and
continued weak growth in non-traditional exports led to disappointing
growth in 2001. Ghana opted for debt relief under the Heavily Indebted
Poor Country (HIPC) program in 2002.

Gibraltar

Introduction

Gibraltar

Background:  Strategically important, Gibraltar was ceded to Great
Britain by Spain in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht; the British garrison was
formally declared a colony in 1830. In a 1967 referendum, Gibraltarians
ignored Spanish pressure and voted overwhelmingly to remain a British
dependency. Spain and the UK are discussing the issue of Gibraltar and
have set the goal of reaching an agreement by mid-2002.

Economy Gibraltar

Economy - overview:  Gibraltar benefits from an extensive shipping trade,
offshore banking, and its position as an international conference
center. The British military presence has been sharply reduced and
now contributes about 11% to the local economy. The financial sector
accounts for 20% of GDP; tourism (almost 6 million visitors in 1998),
shipping services fees, and duties on consumer goods also generate
revenue.  In recent years, Gibraltar has seen major structural change
from a public to a private sector economy, but changes in government
spending still have a major impact on the level of employment.

Economy Grenada

Economy - overview:  Despite government steadying of annual economic
growth in recent years through progress in fiscal reform and prudent
macroeconomic management, a downturn in tourist arrivals in 2001 threatens
government spending in 2002. Grenada relies on tourism as its main
source of foreign exchange, although it also supports a small agriculture
sector and a developing offshore financial industry. Short-term concerns
include a rising fiscal deficit and the deterioration in the external
account balance.

Economy Greenland

Economy - overview:  The economy remains critically dependent on exports
of fish and substantial support from the Danish Government, which supplies
about half of government revenues. The public sector, including publicly
owned enterprises and the municipalities, plays the dominant role
in the economy.  Despite several interesting hydrocarbon and minerals
exploration activities, it will take several years before production can
materialize. Tourism is the only sector offering any near-term potential,
and even this is limited due to a short season and high costs.

Germany

Introduction

Germany

Background:  As Europe's largest economy and most populous nation,
Germany remains a key member of the continent's economic, political,
and defense organizations.  European power struggles immersed the country
in two devastating World Wars in the first half of the 20th century and
left the country occupied by the victorious Allied powers of the US, UK,
France, and the Soviet Union in 1945. With the advent of the Cold War, two
German states were formed in 1949: the western Federal Republic of Germany
(FRG) and the eastern German Democratic Republic (GDR). The democratic
FRG embedded itself in key Western economic and security organizations,
the EC, which became the EU, and NATO, while the communist GDR was on the
front line of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. The decline of the USSR and the
end of the Cold War allowed for German unification in 1990. Since then
Germany has expended considerable funds to bring eastern productivity
and wages up to western standards. In January 2002, Germany and 11 other
EU countries introduced a common European currency, the euro.

Economy Germany

Economy - overview:  Germany's affluent and technologically powerful
economy turned in a relatively weak performance throughout much of the
1990s. The modernization and integration of the eastern German economy
continues to be a costly long-term problem, with annual transfers
from west to east amounting to roughly $70 billion. Germany's ageing
population, combined with high unemployment, has pushed social security
outlays to a level exceeding contributions from workers. Structural
rigidities in the labor market - including strict regulations on
laying off workers and the setting of wages on a national basis -
have made unemployment a chronic problem. Business and income tax cuts
introduced in 2001 did not spare Germany from the impact of the downturn
in international trade, and domestic demand faltered as unemployment began
to rise. The government expects growth to gain pace in the second half of
2002, but to fall short of 1% for the year again. Corporate restructuring
and growing capital markets are setting the foundations that could allow
Germany to meet the long-term challenges of European economic integration
and globalization, particularly if labor market rigidities are addressed.

Economy Guadeloupe

Economy - overview:  The economy depends on agriculture, tourism, light
industry, and services. It also depends on France for large subsidies
and imports. Tourism is a key industry, with most tourists from the US;
an increasingly large number of cruise ships visit the islands. The
traditional sugarcane crop is slowly being replaced by other crops, such
as bananas (which now supply about 50% of export earnings), eggplant,
and flowers. Other vegetables and root crops are cultivated for local
consumption, although Guadeloupe is still dependent on imported food,
mainly from France. Light industry features sugar and rum production. Most
manufactured goods and fuel are imported.  Unemployment is especially
high among the young. Hurricanes periodically devastate the economy.

Economy Guam

Economy - overview:  The economy depends on US military spending,
tourism, and the export of fish and handicrafts. Total US grants, wage

construction boom for new hotels and the expansion of older ones. More
than 1 million tourists visit Guam each year. The industry has recently
suffered setbacks because of the continuing Japanese slowdown; the
Japanese normally make up almost 90% of the tourists. Most food and
industrial goods are imported. Guam faces the problem of building up
the civilian economic sector to offset the impact of military downsizing.

Introduction

Greece

Background:  Greece achieved its independence from the Ottoman Empire in
1829. During the second half of the 19th century and the first half of
the 20th century, it gradually added neighboring islands and territories
with Greek-speaking populations. Following the defeat of Communist
rebels in 1949, Greece joined NATO in 1952. A military dictatorship,
which in 1967 suspended many political liberties and forced the king to
flee the country, lasted seven years. Democratic elections in 1974 and a
referendum created a parliamentary republic and abolished the monarchy;
Greece joined the European Community or EC in 1981 (which became the EU
in 1992).

Economy Greece

Economy - overview:  Greece has a mixed capitalist economy with the public
sector accounting for about half of GDP. Tourism is a key industry,

has improved steadily over the last few years, as the government tightened
policy in the run-up to Greece's entry into the EU's Economic and Monetary
Union (EMU) on 1 January 2001. Major challenges remaining include the
reduction of unemployment and further restructuring of the economy,
including privatizing several state enterprises, undertaking social
security reforms, overhauling the tax system, and minimizing bureaucratic
inefficiencies. Economic growth is forecast at 3%-3.5% in 2002.

Introduction

Guatemala

Background:  Guatemala was freed of Spanish colonial rule in 1821. During
the second half of the 20th century, it experienced a variety of military
and civilian governments as well as a 36-year guerrilla war. In 1996,
the government signed a peace agreement formally ending the conflict,
which had led to the death of more than 100,000 people and had created
some 1 million refugees.

Economy Guatemala

Economy - overview:  The agricultural sector accounts for about one-fourth
of GDP, two-thirds of exports, and half of the labor force. Coffee,
sugar, and bananas are the main products. Former President ARZU
(1996-2000) worked to implement a program of economic liberalization
and political modernization. The 1996 signing of the peace accords,
which ended 36 years of civil war, removed a major obstacle to foreign
investment. In 1998, Hurricane Mitch caused relatively little damage to
Guatemala compared to its neighbors. Ongoing challenges include increasing
government revenues, negotiating further assistance from international
donors, and increasing the efficiency and openness of both government
and private financial operations.  Despite low international prices
for Guatemala's main commodities, the economy grew by 3% in 2000 and
2.3% in 2001. Guatemala, along with Honduras and El Salvador, recently
concluded a free trade agreement with Mexico and has moved to protect
international property rights. However, the PORTILLO administration has
undertaken a review of privatizations under the previous administration,
thereby creating some uncertainty among investors.

Economy Guinea

Economy - overview:  Guinea possesses major mineral, hydropower, and
agricultural resources, yet remains an underdeveloped nation. The country
possesses over 30% of the world's bauxite reserves and is the second
largest bauxite producer. The mining sector accounted for about 75% of
exports in 1999. Long-run improvements in government fiscal arrangements,
literacy, and the legal framework are needed if the country is to move out
of poverty. The government made encouraging progress in budget management
in 1997-99, and reform progress was praised in the World Bank/IMF October
2000 assessment. However, escalating fighting along the Sierra Leonean
and Liberian borders has caused major economic disruptions. In addition to
direct defense costs, the violence has led to a sharp decline in investor
confidence.  Foreign mining companies have reduced expatriate staff, while
panic buying has created food shortages and inflation in local markets.
Multilateral aid - including Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
debt relief - and single digit inflation should permit 5% growth in 2002.

Economy Guyana

Economy - overview:  The Guyanese economy has exhibited moderate economic
growth since 1999, based on an expansion in the agricultural and mining
sectors, a more favorable atmosphere for business initiatives, a more
realistic exchange rate, fairly low inflation, and the continued support
of international organizations. Chronic problems include a shortage
of skilled labor and a deficient infrastructure. The government is
juggling a sizable external debt against the urgent need for expanded
public investment. Low prices for key mining and agricultural commodities
combined with troubles in the bauxite and sugar industries threaten the
government's already tenuous fiscal position and dim prospects for 2002.

Gaza Strip

Introduction Gaza Strip

Background:  The Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles on Interim
Self-Government Arrangements (the DOP), signed in Washington on 13
September 1993, provided for a transitional period not exceeding five
years of Palestinian interim self-government in the Gaza Strip and
the West Bank. Under the DOP, Israel agreed to transfer certain powers
and responsibilities to the Palestinian Authority, which includes the
Palestinian Legislative Council elected in January 1996, as part of the
interim self-governing arrangements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. A
transfer of powers and responsibilities for the Gaza Strip and Jericho
took place pursuant to the Israel-PLO 4 May 1994 Cairo Agreement on
the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area and in additional areas of the West
Bank pursuant to the Israel-PLO 28 September 1995 Interim Agreement, the
Israel-PLO 15 January 1997 Protocol Concerning Redeployment in Hebron,
the Israel-PLO 23 October 1998 Wye River Memorandum, and the 4 September
1999 Sharm el-Sheikh Agreement. The DOP provides that Israel will retain
responsibility during the transitional period for external security
and for internal security and public order of settlements and Israeli
citizens. Direct negotiations to determine the permanent status of Gaza
and West Bank had begun in September 1999 after a three-year hiatus,
but have been derailed by a second intifadah that broke out in September
2000. The resulting widespread violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
Israel's military response, and instability within the Palestinian
Authority continue to undermine progress toward a permanent agreement.

Economy Gaza Strip

Economy - overview:  Economic output in the Gaza Strip - under the
responsibility of the Palestinian Authority since the Cairo Agreement of
May 1994 - declined by about one-third between 1992 and 1996. The downturn
was largely the result of Israeli closure policies - the imposition
of generalized border closures in response to security incidents in
Israel - which disrupted previously established labor and commodity
market relationships between Israel and the WBGS (West Bank and Gaza
Strip). The most serious negative social effect of this downturn was
the emergence of high unemployment; unemployment in the WBGS during the
1980s was generally under 5%; by 1995 it had risen to over 20%. Israel's
use of comprehensive closures decreased during the next few years and,
in 1998, Israel implemented new policies to reduce the impact of closures
and other security procedures on the movement of Palestinian goods and
labor. These changes fueled an almost three-year-long economic recovery
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip; real GDP grew by 5% in 1998 and 6%
in 1999. Recovery was upended in the last quarter of 2000 with the
outbreak of Palestinian violence, triggering tight Israeli closures of
Palestinian self-rule areas and a severe disruption of trade and labor
movements. In 2001, and even more severely in early 2002, internal turmoil
and Israeli military measures in Palestinian Authority areas resulted in
the destruction of capital plant and administrative structure, widespread
business closures, and a sharp drop in GDP. Another major loss has been
the decline in income earned by Palestinian workers in Israel.

Introduction

Haiti

Background:  One of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere,
Haiti has been plagued by political violence for most of its history. Over
three decades of dictatorship followed by military rule ended in 1990
when Jean-Bertrand ARISTIDE was elected president. Most of his term was
usurped by a military takeover, but he was able to return to office in
1994 and oversee the installation of a close associate to the presidency
in 1996. ARISTIDE won a second term as president in 2000, and took office
early in 2001. However, a political crisis stemming from fraudulent
legislative elections in 2000 has not yet been resolved.

Economy Haiti

Economy - overview:  About 80% of the population lives in abject
poverty. Nearly 70% of all Haitians depend on the agriculture sector,
which consists mainly of small-scale subsistence farming and employs
about two-thirds of the economically active work force. The country
has experienced little job creation since the former President
PREVAL took office in February 1996, although the informal economy
is growing. Following legislative elections in May 2000, fraught with
irregularities, international donors - including the US and EU - suspended
almost all aid to Haiti. The economy shrank an estimated 1.2% in 2001,
and the contraction will likely intensify in 2002 unless a political
agreement with donors is reached and aid restored.

in the 19th century.  Pursuant to an agreement signed by China and
the UK on 19 December 1984, Hong Kong became the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) of China on 1 July 1997. In this agreement,
China has promised that, under its "one country, two systems" formula,
China's socialist economic system will not be imposed on Hong Kong and
that Hong Kong will enjoy a high degree of autonomy in all matters except
foreign and defense affairs for the next 50 years.

Economy Hong Kong

Economy - overview:  Hong Kong has a bustling free market economy highly
dependent on international trade. Natural resources are limited, and
food and raw materials must be imported. Indeed, imports and exports,
including reexports, each exceed GDP in dollar value. Even before Hong
Kong reverted to Chinese administration on 1 July 1997 it had extensive
trade and investment ties with China. Per capita GDP compares with the
level in the four big economies of Western Europe. GDP growth averaged
a strong 5% in 1989-97. The widespread Asian economic difficulties
in 1998 hit this trade-dependent economy quite hard, with GDP down 5%.
The economy, with growth of 10% in 2000, recovered rapidly from the Asian
financial crisis. The recent global downturn has badly hurt Hong Kong's
exports and GDP growth is estimated to be 0% in 2001.  Private sector
analysts project 2002 GDP growth to be 1.8%.

Honduras

Introduction

Honduras

Background:  Part of Spain's vast empire in the New World, Honduras
became an independent nation in 1821. After two and one-half decades of
mostly military rule, a freely elected civilian government came to power
in 1982. During the 1980s, Honduras proved a haven for anti-Sandinista
contras fighting the Marxist Nicaraguan Government and an ally to
Salvadoran Government forces fighting against leftist guerrillas.

Geography Honduras

Natural hazards:  frequent, but generally mild, earthquakes; extremely
susceptible to damaging hurricanes and floods along the Caribbean coast

Environment - current issues:  urban population expanding; deforestation
results from logging and the clearing of land for agricultural purposes;
further land degradation and soil erosion hastened by uncontrolled
development and improper land use practices such as farming of marginal
lands; mining activities polluting Lago de Yojoa (the country's largest
source of fresh water) as well as several rivers and streams with
heavy metals

Economy Honduras

Economy - overview:  Honduras, one of the poorest countries in the Western
Hemisphere with an extraordinarily unequal distribution of income, is
banking on expanded trade privileges under the Enhanced Caribbean Basin
Initiative and on debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) initiative. While the country has met most of its macroeconomic
targets, it failed to meet the IMF's goals to liberalize its energy and
telecommunications sectors. Growth remains dependent on the status of the
US economy, its major trading partner, on commodity prices, particularly
coffee, and on containment of the recent rise in crime.

Croatia

Introduction

Croatia

Background:  In 1918, the Croats, Serbs, and Slovenes formed a kingdom
known after 1929 as Yugoslavia. Following World War II, Yugoslavia became
an independent communist state under the strong hand of Marshal TITO.
Although Croatia declared its independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, it
took four years of sporadic, but often bitter, fighting before occupying
Serb armies were mostly cleared from Croatian lands.  Under UN supervision
the last Serb-held enclave in eastern Slavonia was returned to Croatia
in 1998.

Economy Croatia

Economy - overview:  Before the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the Republic
of Croatia, after Slovenia, was the most prosperous and industrialized
area, with a per capita output perhaps one-third above the Yugoslav
average. The economy emerged from its mild recession in 2000 with
tourism the main factor, but massive structural unemployment remains
a key negative element. The government's failure to press the economic
reforms needed to spur growth is largely the result of coalition politics
and public resistance, particularly from the trade unions, to measures
that would cut jobs, wages, or social benefits. As a result, the country
is likely to experience only moderate growth without disciplined fiscal
and structural reform.

Hungary

Introduction

Hungary

Background:  Hungary was part of the polyglot Austro-Hungarian Empire,
which collapsed during World War I. The country fell under communist
rule following World War II. In 1956, a revolt and announced withdrawal
from the Warsaw Pact were met with a massive military intervention by
Moscow. In the more open GORBACHEV years, Hungary led the movement to
dissolve the Warsaw Pact and steadily shifted toward multiparty democracy
and a market-oriented economy. Following the collapse of the USSR in 1991,
Hungary developed close political and economic ties to Western Europe. It
joined NATO in 1999 and is a frontrunner in a future expansion of the EU.

Iceland

Introduction

Iceland

Background:  Settled by Norwegian and Celtic (Scottish and Irish)
immigrants during the late 9th and 10th centuries A.D., Iceland boasts the
world's oldest functioning legislative assembly, the Althing, established
in 930. Independent for over 300 years, Iceland was subsequently ruled
by Norway and Denmark. Fallout from the Askja volcano of 1875 devastated
the Icelandic economy and caused widespread famine. Over the next quarter
century, 20% of the island's population emigrated, mostly to Canada and
the US. Limited home rule from Denmark was granted in 1874 and complete
independence attained in 1944. Literacy, longevity, income, and social
cohesion are first-rate by world standards.

Economy Iceland

Economy - overview:  Iceland's Scandinavian-type economy is basically
capitalistic, yet with an extensive welfare system, low unemployment, and
remarkably even distribution of income. In the absence of other natural
resources (except for abundant hydrothermal and geothermal power),
the economy depends heavily on the fishing industry, providing 70%
of export earnings and employing 12% of the work force. The economy
remains sensitive to declining fish stocks as well as to drops in
world prices for its main exports: fish and fish products, aluminum,
and ferrosilicon. The center-right government plans to continue its
policies of reducing the budget and current account deficits, limiting
foreign borrowing, containing inflation, revising agricultural and
fishing policies, diversifying the economy, and privatizing state-owned
industries. The government remains opposed to EU membership, primarily
because of Icelanders' concern about losing control over their fishing
resources.  Iceland's economy has been diversifying into manufacturing and
service industries in the last decade, and new developments in software
production, biotechnology, and financial services are taking place. The
tourism sector is also expanding, with the recent trends in ecotourism
and whale watching. Growth has been remarkably steady over the past five
years at 4%-5%.

Economy Indonesia

Economy - overview:  Indonesia, a vast polyglot nation, faces severe
economic development problems, stemming from secessionist movements and
the low level of security in the regions, the lack of reliable legal
recourse in contract disputes, corruption, weaknesses in the banking
system, and strained relations with the IMF. Investor confidence will
remain low and few new jobs will be created under these circumstances. In
November 2001, Indonesia agreed with the IMF on a series of economic
reforms in 2002, thus enabling further IMF disbursements.  Keys to
future growth remain internal reform, the build-up of the confidence
of international donors and investors, and a strong comeback in the
global economy.

India

Introduction

India

Background:  The Indus Valley civilization, one of the oldest in the
world, goes back at least 5,000 years. Aryan tribes from the northwest
invaded about 1500 B.C.; their merger with the earlier inhabitants created
the classical Indian culture. Arab incursions starting in the 8th century
and Turkish in 12th were followed by European traders beginning in the
late 15th century. By the 19th century, Britain had assumed political
control of virtually all Indian lands.  Nonviolent resistance to British
colonialism under Mohandas GANDHI and Jawaharlal NEHRU led to independence
in 1947. The subcontinent was divided into the secular state of India
and the smaller Muslim state of Pakistan. A third war between the
two countries in 1971 resulted in East Pakistan becoming the separate
nation of Bangladesh. Fundamental concerns in India include the ongoing
dispute with Pakistan over Kashmir, massive overpopulation, environmental
degradation, extensive poverty, and ethnic and religious strife, all
this despite impressive gains in economic investment and output.

Economy India

Economy - overview:  India's economy encompasses traditional village
farming, modern agriculture, handicrafts, a wide range of modern
industries, and a multitude of support services. About a quarter
of the population is too poor to be able to afford an adequate
diet. India's international payments position remained strong in 2001
with adequate foreign exchange reserves, and moderately depreciating
nominal exchange rates.  Growth in manufacturing output has slowed,
and electricity shortages continue in many regions. India has large
numbers of well-educated people skilled in English language; India is
a major exporter of software services and software workers.

Telephone system:  general assessment: mediocre service; local and long
distance service provided throughout all regions of the country, with
services primarily concentrated in the urban areas; major objective is
to continue to expand and modernize long-distance network to keep pace
with rapidly growing number of local subscriber lines; steady improvement
is taking place with the recent admission of private and private-public
investors, but, with telephone density at about two for each 100 persons
and a waiting list of over 2 million, demand for main line telephone
service will not be satisfied for a very long time domestic: local
service is provided by microwave radio relay and coaxial cable, with
open wire and obsolete electromechanical and manual switchboard systems
still in use in rural areas; starting in the 1980s, a substantial amount
of digital switch gear has been introduced for local and long-distance
service; long-distance traffic is carried mostly by coaxial cable and
low-capacity microwave radio relay; since 1985 significant trunk capacity
has been added in the form of fiber-optic cable and a domestic satellite
system with 254 earth stations; mobile cellular service is provided
in four metropolitan cities international: satellite earth stations -
8 Intelsat (Indian Ocean) and 1 Inmarsat (Indian Ocean region); nine

high traffic sections of the porous boundary; dispute with Bangladesh
over New Moore/South Talpatty Island in the Bay of Bengal; much of
the rugged, militarized boundary with China is in dispute but talks to
resolve the least contested middle sector resumed in 2001; with Pakistan,
armed stand-off over the status and sovereignty of Kashmir continues;
dispute with Pakistan over terminus of Rann of Kutch prevents extension
of a maritime boundary; water-sharing problems with Pakistan persist
over the Indus River (Wular Barrage); Joint Border Committee formed with
Nepal in 2001 is intended to resolve 53 disputed sections of boundary
covering an area of 720 sq km

British Indian Ocean Territory

Introduction

British Indian Ocean Territory

Background:  Established as a territory of the UK in 1965, a number of
the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) islands were transferred to
the Seychelles when it attained independence in 1976. Subsequently, BIOT
has consisted only of the six main island groups comprising the Chagos
Archipelago. The largest and most southerly of the islands, Diego Garcia,
contains a joint UK-US naval support facility. All of the remaining
islands are uninhabited. Former agricultural workers, earlier residents
in the islands, were relocated primarily to Mauritius but also to the
Seychelles, between 1967 and 1973. In 2000, a British High Court ruling
invalidated the local immigration order which had excluded them from
the archipelago, but upheld the special military status of Diego Garcia.

Iran

Introduction

Iran

Background:  Known as Persia until 1935, Iran became an Islamic republic
in 1979 after the ruling shah was forced into exile. Conservative clerical
forces subsequently crushed westernizing liberal elements. Militant
Iranian students seized the US Embassy in Tehran on 4 November 1979 and
held it until 20 January 1981. During 1980-88, Iran fought a bloody,
indecisive war with Iraq over disputed territory. Key current issues
affecting the country include the pace of accepting outside modernizing
influences and reconciliation between clerical control of the regime
and popular government participation and widespread demands for reform.

Economy Iran

Economy - overview:  Iran's economy is a mixture of central planning,
state ownership of oil and other large enterprises, village agriculture,
and small-scale private trading and service ventures. President KHATAMI
has continued to follow the market reform plans of former President
RAFSANJANI and has indicated that he will pursue diversification of
Iran's oil-reliant economy although he has made little progress toward
that goal. The strong oil market in 1996 helped ease financial pressures
on Iran and allowed for Tehran's timely debt service payments. Iran's
financial situation tightened in 1997 and deteriorated further in
1998 because of lower oil prices. The subsequent rise in oil prices
in 1999-2000 afforded Iran fiscal breathing room but does not solve
Iran's structural economic problems, including the encouragement of
foreign investment.

Israel

Introduction

Israel

Background:  Following World War II, the British withdrew from their
mandate of Palestine, and the UN partitioned the area into Arab and Jewish
states, an arrangement rejected by the Arabs. Subsequently, the Israelis
defeated the Arabs in a series of wars without ending the deep tensions
between the two sides. The territories occupied by Israel since the 1967
war are not included in the Israel country profile, unless otherwise
noted. On 25 April 1982, Israel withdrew from the Sinai pursuant to the
1979 Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty. Outstanding territorial and other disputes
with Jordan were resolved in the 26 October 1994 Israel-Jordan Treaty of
Peace. In keeping with the framework established at the Madrid Conference
in October 1991, bilateral negotiations were conducted between Israel
and Palestinian representatives (from the Israeli-occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip) and Syria, to achieve a permanent settlement; however, these
efforts were derailed/postponed by the outbreak of Israeli-Palestinian
violence in September 2000. On 25 May 2000, Israel withdrew unilaterally
from southern Lebanon, which it had occupied since 1982.

Economy Israel

Economy - overview:  Israel has a technologically advanced market economy
with substantial government participation. It depends on imports of
crude oil, grains, raw materials, and military equipment. Despite
limited natural resources, Israel has intensively developed its
agricultural and industrial sectors over the past 20 years. Israel
is largely self-sufficient in food production except for grains. Cut
diamonds, high-technology equipment, and agricultural products (fruits and
vegetables) are the leading exports. Israel usually posts sizable current
account deficits, which are covered by large transfer payments from abroad
and by foreign loans. Roughly half of the government's external debt
is owed to the US, which is its major source of economic and military
aid. The influx of Jewish immigrants from the former USSR during the
period 1989-99 coupled with the opening of new markets at the end of the
Cold War, energized Israel's economy, which grew rapidly in the early
1990s.  But growth began moderating in 1996 when the government imposed
tighter fiscal and monetary policies and the immigration bonus petered
out. Growth was a strong 6.4% in 2000. But the outbreak of Palestinian
unrest in late September 2000 and the declines in the high-technology
and tourist sectors led to a 0.6% drop in GDP in 2001.

Italy

Introduction

Italy

Background:  Italy became a nation-state in 1861 when the city-states
of the peninsula, along with Sardinia and Sicily, were united under
King Victor EMMANUEL.  An era of parliamentary government came to a
close in the early 1920s when Benito MUSSOLINI established a Fascist
dictatorship. His disastrous alliance with Nazi Germany led to Italy's
defeat in World War II. A democratic republic replaced the monarchy in
1946 and economic revival followed. Italy was a charter member of NATO
and the European Economic Community (EEC). It has been at the forefront
of European economic and political unification, joining the European
Monetary Union in 1999. Persistent problems include illegal immigration,
the ravages of organized crime, corruption, high unemployment, and the
low incomes and technical standards of southern Italy compared with the
prosperous north.

Economy Italy

Economy - overview:  Italy has a diversified industrial economy with
roughly the same total and per capita output as France and the UK. This
capitalistic economy remains divided into a developed industrial north,
dominated by private companies, and a less developed agricultural
south, with 20% unemployment. Most raw materials needed by industry
and more than 75% of energy requirements are imported. Over the past
decade, Italy has pursued a tight fiscal policy in order to meet the
requirements of the Economic and Monetary Unions and has benefited from
lower interest and inflation rates. Italy's economic performance has
lagged behind that of its EU partners, and the current government has
enacted numerous short-term reforms aimed at improving competitiveness
and long-term growth. Rome has moved slowly, however, on implementing
needed structural reforms, such as lightening the high tax burden and
overhauling Italy's rigid labor market and expensive pension system,
because of the current economic slowdown and opposition from labor unions.

Cote d'Ivoire

Introduction Cote d'Ivoire

Background:  Close ties to France since independence in 1960, the
development of cocoa production for export, and foreign investment
made Cote d'Ivoire one of the most prosperous of the tropical African
states. Falling cocoa prices and political turmoil, however, sparked an
economic downturn in 1999 and 2000. On 25 December 1999, a military coup
- the first ever in Cote d'Ivoire's history - overthrew the government
led by President Henri Konan BEDIE. Presidential and legislative
elections held in October and December 2000 provoked violence due to
the exclusion of opposition leader Alassane OUATTARA. In October 2000,
Laurent GBAGBO replaced junta leader Robert GUEI as president, ending
10 months of military rule. In October 2001, President GBAGBO initiated
a two-month-long National Reconciliation Forum, but its ability to
conciliate Ivorians with one another remains unclear.

Economy Cote d'Ivoire

Economy - overview:  Cote d'Ivoire is among the world's largest producers
and exporters of coffee, cocoa beans, and palm oil. Consequently, the
economy is highly sensitive to fluctuations in international prices for
these products and to weather conditions. Despite government attempts
to diversify the economy, it is still largely dependent on agriculture
and related activities, which engage roughly 68% of the population. After
several years of lagging performance, the Ivorian economy began a comeback
in 1994, due to the 50% devaluation of the CFA franc and improved prices
for cocoa and coffee, growth in nontraditional primary exports such
as pineapples and rubber, limited trade and banking liberalization,
offshore oil and gas discoveries, and generous external financing
and debt rescheduling by multilateral lenders and France. Moreover,
government adherence to donor-mandated reforms led to a jump in growth
to 5% annually during 1996-99. Growth was negative in 2000 and 2001
because of the difficulty of meeting the conditions of international
donors, continued low prices of key exports, and post-coup instability.
Political instability continues to impede growth.

Iraq

Introduction

Iraq

Background:  Formerly part of the Ottoman Empire, Iraq became an
independent kingdom in 1932. A "republic" was proclaimed in 1958, but
in actuality a series of military strongmen have ruled the country since
then, the latest being SADDAM Husayn. Territorial disputes with Iran led
to an inconclusive and costly eight-year war (1980-88). In August 1990
Iraq seized Kuwait, but was expelled by US-led, UN coalition forces during
January-February 1991. The victors did not occupy Iraq, however, thus
allowing the regime to stay in control. Following Kuwait's liberation,
the UN Security Council (UNSC) required Iraq to scrap all weapons of
mass destruction and long-range missiles and to allow UN verification
inspections. UN trade sanctions remain in effect due to incomplete Iraqi
compliance with relevant UNSC resolutions.

Economy Iraq

Economy - overview:  Iraq's economy is dominated by the oil sector, which
has traditionally provided about 95% of foreign exchange earnings. In
the 1980s financial problems caused by massive expenditures in the
eight-year war with Iran and damage to oil export facilities by Iran
led the government to implement austerity measures, borrow heavily, and
later reschedule foreign debt payments; Iraq suffered economic losses
from the war of at least $100 billion. After hostilities ended in 1988,
oil exports gradually increased with the construction of new pipelines
and restoration of damaged facilities. Iraq's seizure of Kuwait in
August 1990, subsequent international economic sanctions, and damage
from military action by an international coalition beginning in January
1991 drastically reduced economic activity. Although government policies
supporting large military and internal security forces and allocating
resources to key supporters of the regime have hurt the economy,
implementation of the UN's oil-for-food program in December 1996 has
helped improve conditions for the average Iraqi citizen. For the first
six, six-month phases of the program, Iraq was allowed to export limited
amounts of oil in exchange for food, medicine, and some infrastructure
spare parts.  In December 1999 the UN Security Council authorized Iraq to
export under the program as much oil as required to meet humanitarian
needs. Oil exports are now more than three-quarters prewar level.
However, 28% of Iraq's export revenues under the program are deducted to
meet UN Compensation Fund and UN administrative expenses. The drop in GDP
in 2001 was largely the result of the global economic slowdown and lower
oil prices. Per capita food imports have increased significantly, while
medical supplies and health care services are steadily improving. Per
capita output and living standards are still well below the prewar level,
but any estimates have a wide range of error.

Japan

Introduction

Japan

Background:  While retaining its time-honored culture, Japan rapidly
absorbed Western technology during the late 19th and early 20th
centuries. After its devastating defeat in World War II, Japan recovered
to become the second most powerful economy in the world and a staunch
ally of the US. While the emperor retains his throne as a symbol of
national unity, actual power rests in networks of powerful politicians,
bureaucrats, and business executives. The economy experienced a major
slowdown in the 1990s following three decades of unprecedented growth.

Economy Japan

Economy - overview:  Government-industry cooperation, a strong work
ethic, mastery of high technology, and a comparatively small defense
allocation (1% of GDP) have helped Japan advance with extraordinary
rapidity to the rank of second most technologically powerful economy
in the world after the US and third largest economy in the world
after the US and China. One notable characteristic of the economy is
the working together of manufacturers, suppliers, and distributors in
closely-knit groups called keiretsu. A second basic feature has been
the guarantee of lifetime employment for a substantial portion of the
urban labor force. Both features are now eroding. Industry, the most
important sector of the economy, is heavily dependent on imported raw
materials and fuels. The much smaller agricultural sector is highly
subsidized and protected, with crop yields among the highest in the
world. Usually self-sufficient in rice, Japan must import about 50%
of its requirements of other grain and fodder crops. Japan maintains
one of the world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15%
of the global catch. For three decades overall real economic growth had
been spectacular: a 10% average in the 1960s, a 5% average in the 1970s,
and a 4% average in the 1980s. Growth slowed markedly in the 1990s largely
because of the aftereffects of overinvestment during the late 1980s and
contractionary domestic policies intended to wring speculative excesses
from the stock and real estate markets. Government efforts to revive
economic growth have met with little success and were further hampered
in 2000-01 by the slowing of the US and Asian economies. The crowding
of habitable land area and the aging of the population are two major
long-run problems. Robotics constitutes a key long-term economic strength,
with Japan possessing 410,000 of the world's 720,000 "working robots".

Economy Jersey

Economy - overview:  The economy is based largely on international
financial services, agriculture, and tourism. Potatoes, cauliflower,
tomatoes, and especially flowers are important export crops, shipped
mostly to the UK. The Jersey breed of dairy cattle is known worldwide
and represents an important export income earner. Milk products go to
the UK and other EU countries. In 1996 the finance sector accounted
for about 60% of the island's output. Tourism, another mainstay of the
economy, accounts for 24% of GDP. In recent years, the government has
encouraged light industry to locate in Jersey, with the result that an
electronics industry has developed alongside the traditional manufacturing
of knitwear. All raw material and energy requirements are imported,
as well as a large share of Jersey's food needs. Light taxes and death
duties make the island a popular tax haven.

Introduction

Jamaica

Background:  Jamaica gained full independence within the British
Commonwealth in 1962. Deteriorating economic conditions during the
1970s led to recurrent violence and a dropoff in tourism. Elections

governments have been open market oriented. Political violence marred
elections during the 1990s.

Economy Jamaica

Economy - overview:  The economy, which depends heavily on tourism and
bauxite, has been stagnant since 1995. After five years of recession,
the economy grew 0.8% in 2000 and 1.1% in 2001, but the global economic
slowdown, particularly in the United States after the 11 September
terrorist attacks, has stunted the economic recovery. Serious problems
include: high interest rates; increased foreign competition; a pressured,
sometimes sliding, exchange rate; a widening merchandise trade deficit;
and a growing internal debt, the result of government bailouts to
various ailing sectors of the economy, particularly the financial
sector. Depressed economic conditions have led to increased civil unrest,
including a mounting crime rate. Jamaica's medium-term prospects will
depend upon encouraging investment, maintaining a competitive exchange
rate, selling off reacquired firms, and implementing proper fiscal and
monetary policies.

Jordan

Introduction

Jordan

Background:  For most of its history since independence from British
administration in 1946, Jordan was ruled by King HUSSEIN (1953-1999). A
pragmatic ruler, he successfully navigated competing pressures from
the major powers (US, USSR, and UK), various Arab states, Israel,
and a large internal Palestinian population, through several wars and
coup attempts. In 1989 he resumed parliamentary elections and gradually
permitted political liberalization; in 1994 a formal peace treaty was
signed with Israel. King ABDALLAH II - the eldest son of King HUSSEIN
and Princess MUNA - assumed the throne following his father's death in
February 1999. Since then, he has consolidated his power and established
his domestic priorities.

Economy Jordan

Economy - overview:  Jordan is a small Arab country with inadequate
supplies of water and other natural resources such as oil. Debt,
poverty, and unemployment are fundamental problems, but King ABDALLAH
since assuming the throne in 1999 has undertaken some broad economic
reforms in a long-term effort to improve living standards. Amman in the
past three years has signed on to an IMF agreement, practiced careful
monetary policy, and made significant headway with privatization. The
government also has liberalized the trade regime sufficiently to secure
Jordan's membership in the WTrO, an association agreement with the EU,
and a free trade accord with US. These measures have helped improve
productivity and have put Jordan on the foreign investment map. Ongoing
challenges include fiscal adjustment to reduce the budget deficit and
broader investment incentives to promote job-creating ventures.

Johnston Atoll

Introduction

Johnston Atoll

Background:  Both the US and the Kingdom of Hawaii annexed Johnston
Atoll in 1858, but it was the US that mined the guano deposits until the
late 1880s. The US Navy took over the atoll in 1934, and subsequently
the US Air Force assumed control in 1948. The site was used for high
altitude nuclear tests in the 1950s and 1960s, and until late in 2000
the atoll was maintained as a storage and disposal site for chemical
weapons. Munitions destruction is now complete. Cleanup and closure of
the facility is progressing, with completion anticipated in 2004.

Kenya

Introduction

Kenya

Background:  Founding president and liberation struggle icon Jomo
KENYATTA led Kenya from independence until his death in 1978, when
current President Daniel Toroitich arap MOI took power in a constitutional
succession. The country was a de facto one-party state from 1969 until
1982 when the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) made itself the
sole legal party in Kenya. MOI acceded to internal and external pressure
for political liberalization in late 1991. The ethnically fractured
opposition failed to dislodge KANU from power in elections in 1992 and
1997, which were marred by violence and fraud, but are viewed as having
generally reflected the will of the Kenyan people. The country faces a
period of political uncertainty because MOI is constitutionally required
to step down at the next election that has to be held by early 2003.

Economy Kenya

Economy - overview:  Kenya, the regional hub for trade and finance in East
Africa, is hampered by corruption and reliance upon several primary goods
whose prices continue to decline. Following strong economic growth in 1995
and 1996, Kenya's economy has stagnated, with GDP growth failing to keep
up with the rate of population growth. In 1997, the IMF suspended Kenya's
Enhanced Structural Adjustment Program due to the government's failure
to maintain reforms and curb corruption. A severe drought from 1999 to
2000 compounded Kenya's problems, causing water and energy rationing
and reducing agricultural output. As a result, GDP contracted by 0.3%
in 2000. The IMF, which had resumed loans in 2000 to help Kenya through
the drought, again halted lending in 2001 when the government failed
to institute several anticorruption measures. Despite the return of
strong rains in 2001, weak commodity prices, endemic corruption, and low
investment limited Kenya's economic growth to 1%, and Kenya is unlikely
to see growth above 2% in 2002. Substantial IMF and other foreign support
is essential to prevent a further decline in real per capita output.

GDP:  purchasing power parity - $31 billion (2001 est.)

Economy Kyrgyzstan

Economy - overview:  Kyrgyzstan is a small, poor, mountainous country
with a predominantly agricultural economy. Cotton, wool, and meat are
the main agricultural products and exports. Industrial exports include
gold, mercury, uranium, and electricity. Kyrgyzstan has been one of
the most progressive countries of the former Soviet Union in carrying
out market reforms. With fits and starts, inflation has been lowered to
an estimated 7% in 2001. Much of the government's stock in enterprises
has been sold. Drops in production had been severe since the breakup
of the Soviet Union in December 1991, but by mid-1995 production began
to recover and exports began to increase. Growth was held down to
2.1% in 1998 largely because of the spillover from Russia's economic
difficulties, but moved ahead to 3.6% in 1999, 5% in 2000, and 5% again
in 2001. Despite these gains, poverty indicators are no better in 2001
than in 1996. On the positive side, the government and the international
financial institutions have embarked on a comprehensive medium-term
poverty reduction and economic growth strategy. In November 2001,
with financing assurance from the Paris Club, the IMF Board approved a
three-year, $93 million Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility.

Economy Korea, North

Economy - overview:  North Korea, one of the world's most
centrally planned and isolated economies, faces desperate economic
conditions. Industrial capital stock is nearly beyond repair as a
result of years of underinvestment and spare parts shortages. Industrial
and power output have declined in parallel. Despite a good harvest in
2001, the nation faces its eighth year of food shortages because of
a lack of arable land; collective farming; weather-related problems,
including major drought in 2000; and chronic shortages of fertilizer
and fuel.  Massive international food aid deliveries have allowed the
regime to escape mass starvation since 1995-96, but the population
remains vulnerable to prolonged malnutrition and deteriorating living
conditions. Large-scale military spending eats up resources needed for
investment and civilian consumption. In 2001, the regime placed emphasis
on earning hard currency, developing information technology, addressing
power shortages, and attracting foreign aid, but in no way at the expense
of relinquishing central control over key national assets or undergoing
widespread market-oriented reforms.

Kiribati

Introduction

Kiribati

Background:  The Gilbert Islands were granted self-rule by the UK in 1971

Economy Kiribati

Economy - overview:  A remote country of 33 scattered coral atolls,
Kiribati has few national resources.  Commercially viable phosphate
deposits were exhausted at the time of independence from the UK in
1979. Copra and fish now represent the bulk of production and exports. The
economy has fluctuated widely in recent years. Economic development
is constrained by a shortage of skilled workers, weak infrastructure,
and remoteness from international markets. Tourism provides more than
one-fifth of GDP. The financial sector is at an early stage of development
as is the expansion of private sector initiatives. Foreign financial
aid, from UK, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and China, is a critical
supplement to GDP, equal to 25%-50% of GDP in recent years.  Remittances
from workers abroad account for more than $5 million each year.

Korea, South

Introduction

Korea, South

Background:  After World War II, a republic was set up in the southern
half of the Korean Peninsula while a Communist-style government was
installed in the north. The Korean War (1950-53) had US and other UN
forces intervene to defend South Korea from North Korean attacks supported
by the Chinese. An armistice was signed in 1953 splitting the peninsula
along a demilitarized zone at about the 38th parallel. Thereafter,
South Korea achieved rapid economic growth, with per capita income far
outstripping the level of North Korea. In 1997, the nation suffered
a severe financial crisis from which it continues to make a solid
recovery. South Korea has also maintained its commitment to democratize
its political processes. In June 2000, a historic first south-north
summit took place between the south's President KIM Dae-jung and the
north's leader KIM Chong-il. In December 2000, President KIM Dae-jung
won the Noble Peace Prize for his lifelong commitment to democracy and
human rights in Asia. He is the first Korean to win a Nobel Prize.

Economy Korea, South

Economy - overview:  As one of the Four Tigers of East Asia, South
Korea has achieved an incredible record of growth. Three decades ago
GDP per capita was comparable with levels in the poorer countries
of Africa and Asia. Today its GDP per capita is seven times India's,
17 times North Korea's, and comparable to the lesser economies of the
European Union. This success through the late 1980s was achieved by a
system of close government/business ties, including directed credit,
import restrictions, sponsorship of specific industries, and a strong
labor effort. The government promoted the import of raw materials and
technology at the expense of consumer goods and encouraged savings
and investment over consumption. The Asian financial crisis of 1997-99
exposed certain longstanding weaknesses in South Korea's development
model, including high debt/equity ratios, massive foreign borrowing,
and an undisciplined financial sector. Growth plunged by 6.6% in 1998,
then strongly recovered to plus 10% in 1999 and 9% in 2000. Growth fell
back to 3.3% in 2001 because of the slowing global economy, falling
exports, and the perception that much-needed corporate and financial
reforms have stalled.

Economy Kuwait

Economy - overview:  Kuwait is a small, rich, relatively open
economy with proved crude oil reserves of 94 billion barrels - 10%
of world reserves. Petroleum accounts for nearly half of GDP, 90%
of export revenues, and 75% of government income. Kuwait's climate
limits agricultural development.  Consequently, with the exception of
fish, it depends almost wholly on food imports. About 75% of potable
water must be distilled or imported. Higher oil prices put the FY99/00
budget into a $2 billion surplus. The FY00/01 budget covers only nine
months because of a change in the fiscal year. The budget for FY01/02
envisioned higher expenditures for salaries, construction, and other
general categories. Kuwait continues its discussions with foreign oil
companies to develop fields in the northern part of the country.

Kazakhstan

Introduction

Kazakhstan

Background:  Native Kazakhs, a mix of Turkic and Mongol nomadic tribes
who migrated into the region in the 13th century, were rarely united as a
single nation.  The area was conquered by Russia in the 18th century and
Kazakhstan became a Soviet Republic in 1936. During the 1950s and 1960s
agricultural "Virgin Lands" program, Soviet citizens were encouraged to
help cultivate Kazakhstan's northern pastures. This influx of immigrants
(mostly Russians, but also some other deported nationalities) skewed the
ethnic mixture and enabled non-Kazakhs to outnumber natives. Independence
has caused many of these newcomers to emigrate. Current issues include:
the country's vast energy resources and exporting them to world markets;
achieving a sustainable economic growth outside the oil, gas, and mining
sectors; and strengthening relations with neighboring states and other
foreign powers.

Geography Kazakhstan

Location:  Central Asia, northwest of China

Geographic coordinates:  48 00 N, 68 00 E

Map references:  Asia

Area:  total: 2,717,300 sq km water: 47,500 sq km land: 2,669,800 sq km

Area - comparative:  slightly less than four times the size of Texas

Land boundaries:  total: 12,012 km border countries: China 1,533 km,
Kyrgyzstan 1,051 km, Russia 6,846 km, Turkmenistan 379 km, Uzbekistan
2,203 km

Coastline:  0 km (landlocked); note - Kazakhstan borders the Aral Sea, now
split into two bodies of water (1,070 km), and the Caspian Sea (1,894 km)

Maritime claims:  none (landlocked)

Climate:  continental, cold winters and hot summers, arid and semiarid

Terrain:  extends from the Volga to the Altai Mountains and from the
plains in western Siberia to oases and desert in Central Asia

Elevation extremes:  lowest point: Vpadina Kaundy -132 m highest point:
Khan Tangiri Shyngy (Pik Khan-Tengri) 6,995 m

Natural resources:  major deposits of petroleum, natural gas, coal,
iron ore, manganese, chrome ore, nickel, cobalt, copper, molybdenum,

Land use:  arable land: 11% permanent crops: 0% other: 89% (1998 est.)

Irrigated land:  23,320 sq km (1998 est.)

Natural hazards:  earthquakes in the south, mudslides around Almaty

Environment - current issues:  radioactive or toxic chemical sites
associated with its former defense industries and test ranges throughout
the country pose health risks for humans and animals; industrial pollution
is severe in some cities; because the two main rivers which flowed into
the Aral Sea have been diverted for irrigation, it is drying up and
leaving behind a harmful layer of chemical pesticides and natural salts;
these substances are then picked up by the wind and blown into noxious
dust storms; pollution in the Caspian Sea; soil pollution from overuse
of agricultural chemicals and salination from poor infrastructure and
wasteful irrigation practices

Environment - international agreements:  party to: Air Pollution,
Biodiversity, Climate Change, Desertification, Endangered Species,
Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution signed, but not ratified: Climate
Change-Kyoto Protocol

Economy Kazakhstan

Economy - overview:  Kazakhstan, the largest of the former Soviet
republics in territory, excluding Russia, possesses enormous fossil
fuel reserves as well as plentiful supplies of other minerals and
metals. It also is a large agricultural - livestock and grain -
producer. Kazakhstan's industrial sector rests on the extraction
and processing of these natural resources and also on a growing
machine-building sector specializing in construction equipment, tractors,
agricultural machinery, and some defense items. The breakup of the USSR
in December 1991 and the collapse in demand for Kazakhstan's traditional
heavy industry products resulted in a short-term contraction of the
economy, with the steepest annual decline occurring in 1994. In 1995-97,
the pace of the government program of economic reform and privatization
quickened, resulting in a substantial shifting of assets into the private
sector. Kazakhstan has enjoyed double-digit growth in 2000-01 thanks
largely to its booming energy sector, but also to economic reform, good
harvests, and foreign investment. The opening of the Caspian Consortium
pipeline in 2001, from western Kazakhstan's Tengiz oilfield to the
Black Sea, substantially raises export capacity. Astana has embarked
upon an industrial policy designed to diversify the economy away from
overdependence on the oil sector by developing light industry.

delimiting the Caspian Sea seabed, but littoral states are far from
any multilateral agreement on dividing the waters and seabed regimes
- Iran insists on division of Caspian Sea into five equal sectors
while Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Turkmenistan have generally
agreed upon equidistant seabed boundaries; border largely delimited with
Uzbekistan, but unresolved dispute remains over sovereignty of two border
villages, Bagys and Turkestan, and around the Arnasay dam; Kazakhstan,
Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan wrestle with sharing limited
water resources and the regional environmental degradation caused by
the shrinking of the Aral Sea; disputes with Kyrgyzstan over providing
water and hydropower to Kazakhstan

Illicit drugs:  significant illicit cultivation of cannabis and limited
cultivation of opium poppy and ephedra (for the drug ephedrone); limited
government eradication program; cannabis consumed largely in the CIS; used
as transshipment point for illicit drugs to Russia, North America, and
Western Europe from Southwest Asia; developing heroin addiction problem

Economy Laos

Economy - overview:  The government of Laos - one of the few remaining
official Communist states - began decentralizing control and encouraging
private enterprise in 1986.  The results, starting from an extremely
low base, were striking - growth averaged 7% in 1988-2001 except during
the short-lived drop caused by the Asian financial crisis beginning
in 1997. Despite this high growth rate, Laos remains a country with a
primitive infrastructure; it has no railroads, a rudimentary road system,
and limited external and internal telecommunications. Electricity is
available in only a few urban areas. Subsistence agriculture accounts
for half of GDP and provides 80% of total employment. The economy will
continue to benefit from aid from the IMF and other international sources
and from new foreign investment in food-processing and mining.

Lebanon

Introduction

Lebanon

Background:  Lebanon has made progress toward rebuilding its political
institutions since 1991 and the end of the devastating 16-year civil
war. Under the Ta'if Accord - the blueprint for national reconciliation
- the Lebanese have established a more equitable political system,
particularly by giving Muslims a greater say in the political process
while institutionalizing sectarian divisions in the government. Since the
end of the war, the Lebanese have conducted several successful elections,
most of the militias have been weakened or disbanded, and the Lebanese
Armed Forces (LAF) have extended central government authority over about
two-thirds of the country.  Hizballah, the radical Shi'a party, retains
its weapons. Syria maintains about 20,000 troops in Lebanon based mainly
in Beirut, North Lebanon, and the Bekaa Valley. Syria's troop deployment
was legitimized by the Arab League during Lebanon's civil war and in
the Ta'if Accord. Damascus justifies its continued military presence
in Lebanon by citing Beirut's requests and the failure of the Lebanese
Government to implement all of the constitutional reforms in the Ta'if
Accord. Israel's withdrawal from its security zone in southern Lebanon
in May of 2000, however, has emboldened some Lebanese Christians and
Druze to demand that Syria withdraw its forces as well.

Economy Lebanon

Economy - overview:  The 1975-91 civil war seriously damaged Lebanon's
economic infrastructure, cut national output by half, and all but
ended Lebanon's position as a Middle Eastern entrepot and banking
hub. Peace enabled the central government to restore control in Beirut,
begin collecting taxes, and regain access to key port and government
facilities. Economic recovery was helped by a financially sound banking
system and resilient small- and medium-scale manufacturers. Family
remittances, banking services, manufactured and farm exports, and
international aid provided the main sources of foreign exchange.
Lebanon's economy made impressive gains since the launch in 1993 of
"Horizon 2000," the government's $20 billion reconstruction program. Real
GDP grew 8% in 1994, 7% in 1995, 4% in 1996 and in 1997 but slowed to 2%
in 1998, -1% in 1999, and -0.5% in 2000.  Growth recovered slightly in
2001 to 1%. During the 1990s annual inflation fell to almost 0% from more
than 100%. Lebanon has rebuilt much of its war-torn physical and financial
infrastructure.  The government nonetheless faces serious challenges in
the economic arena. It has funded reconstruction by borrowing heavily
- mostly from domestic banks. The re-installed HARIRI government has
failed to rein in the ballooning national debt. Without large-scale
international aid and rapid privatization of state-owned enterprises,
markets may force a currency devaluation and debt default in 2002.

Introduction

Latvia

Background:  After a brief period of independence between the two World
Wars, Latvia was annexed by the USSR in 1940. It reestablished its
independence in 1991 following the breakup of the Soviet Union. Although
the last Russian troops left in 1994, the status of the Russian minority
(some 30% of the population) remains of concern to Moscow. Latvia
continues to revamp its economy for eventual integration into various
Western European political and economic institutions.

Economy Latvia

Economy - overview:  Latvia's transitional economy recovered from the 1998
Russian financial crisis, largely due to the SKELE government's budget
stringency and a gradual reorientation of exports toward EU countries,
lessening Latvia's trade dependency on Russia. The majority of companies,
banks, and real estate have been privatized. Latvia officially joined
the World Trade Organization in February 1999 - the first Baltic state
to join - and was invited at the Helsinki EU Summit in December 1999 to
begin accession talks in early 2000. Preparing for EU membership over
the next few years remains a top foreign policy goal. The high current
account deficit remains a major concern.

Liberia

Introduction

Liberia

Background:  Seven years of civil strife were brought to a close in
1996 when free and open presidential and legislative elections were
held. President TAYLOR now holds strong executive power with no real
political opposition.  The years of fighting coupled with the flight of
most businesses have disrupted formal economic activity. A still unsettled
domestic security situation has slowed the process of rebuilding the
social and economic structure of this war-torn country. In 2001, the UN
imposed sanctions on Liberian diamonds along with an army embargo and
a travel ban on government officials for Liberia's support of the rebel
insurgency in Sierra Leone.

Economy Liberia

Economy - overview:  A civil war in 1989-96 destroyed much of Liberia's
economy, especially the infrastructure in and around Monrovia. Many
businessmen fled the country, taking capital and expertise with
them. Some returned; many will not return. Richly endowed with water,
mineral resources, forests, and a climate favorable to agriculture,
Liberia had been a producer and exporter of basic products, while
local manufacturing, mainly foreign owned, had been small in scope. The
democratically elected government, installed in August 1997, inherited
massive international debts and currently relies on revenues from its
maritime registry and timber industry to provide the bulk of its foreign
exchange earnings. The restoration of the infrastructure and the raising
of incomes in this ravaged economy depend on the implementation of sound
macro- and micro-economic policies of the new government, including
the encouragement of foreign investment.  Recent growth has been from a
low base, and continued growth will require major policy successes and
containment of armed rebellion.

Slovakia

Introduction

Slovakia

Background:  In 1918 the Slovaks joined the closely related Czechs to form
Czechoslovakia. Following the chaos of World War II, Czechoslovakia became
a Communist nation within Soviet-ruled Eastern Europe. Soviet influence
collapsed in 1989 and Czechoslovakia once more became free. The Slovaks
and the Czechs agreed to separate peacefully on 1 January 1993. Historic,
political, and geographic factors have caused Slovakia to experience
more difficulty in developing a modern market economy than some of its
Central European neighbors.

Economy Slovakia

Economy - overview:  Slovakia has mastered much of the difficult
transition from a centrally planned economy to a modern market
economy. The DZURINDA government made excellent progress in 2001 in
macroeconomic stabilization and structural reform. Major privatizations
are nearly complete, the banking sector is almost completely in foreign
hands, and foreign investment has picked up. Slovakia's economy exceeded
expectations in 2001, despite recession in key export markets. Revival
of domestic demand, partly due to a rise in real wages, offset slowing
export growth to help drive the economy to its strongest expansion since
1998. Solid domestic demand is expected to boost economic growth to 3.4%
in 2002, and about 4% in 2003. Unemployment, rising to 19.8% at the end
of 2001, remained the economy's Achilles' heel.  The government faces
other strong challenges in 2002, especially the maintenance of fiscal
balance ahead of the September 2002 parliamentary election, cutting
budget and current account deficits, and privatization of the Slovak
energy and power monopolies.

Palmyra Atoll

Introduction

Palmyra Atoll

Background:  The Kingdom of Hawaii claimed the atoll in 1862, and the US
included it among the Hawaiian Islands when it annexed the archipelago
in 1898. The Hawaii Statehood Act of 1959 did not include Palmyra Atoll,
which is now privately owned by the Nature Conservancy. This organization
is managing the atoll as a nature preserve. The lagoons and surrounding
waters within the 12 nautical mile US territorial seas were transferred to
the US Fish and Wildlife Service and were designated a National Wildlife

Liechtenstein

Introduction

Liechtenstein

Background:  The Principality of Liechtenstein was established within
the Holy Roman Empire in 1719; it became a sovereign state in 1806. Until
the end of World War I, it was closely tied to Austria, but the economic
devastation caused by that conflict forced Liechtenstein to conclude
a customs and monetary union with Switzerland. Since World War II
(in which Liechtenstein remained neutral) the country's low taxes have
spurred outstanding economic growth. However, shortcomings in banking
regulatory oversight have resulted in concerns about the use of the
financial institutions for money laundering.

Economy Liechtenstein

Economy - overview:  Despite its small size and limited natural resources,
Liechtenstein has developed into a prosperous, highly industrialized,
free-enterprise economy with a vital financial service sector and
living standards on a par with the urban areas of its large European
neighbors. Low business taxes - the maximum tax rate is 18% - and easy
incorporation rules have induced 73,700 holding or so-called letter box
companies to establish nominal offices in Liechtenstein, providing 30%
of state revenues. The country participates in a customs union with
Switzerland and uses the Swiss franc as its national currency. It
imports more than 90% of its energy requirements. Liechtenstein has
been a member of the European Economic Area (an organization serving as
a bridge between European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and EU) since
May 1995. The government is working to harmonize its economic policies
with those of an integrated Europe.

for 1,600 sq km of land in the Czech Republic confiscated in 1918

Illicit drugs:  multilateral organizations engaged in issuing
international guidelines for financial sector oversight found gaps in
Liechtenstein's financial services controls that made it vulnerable
to money laundering, but Liechtenstein has become less attractive
as a haven for illicit funds, based on implementation in 2001 of new
anti-money-laundering legislation and improved mutual legal assistance
cooperation with other countries

Economy Lesotho

Economy - overview:  Small, landlocked, and mountainous, Lesotho's
primary natural resource is water. Its economy is based on subsistence
agriculture, livestock, remittances from miners employed in South Africa,
and a rapidly growing apparel-assembly sector. The number of mineworkers
has declined steadily over the past several years. A small manufacturing
base depends largely on farm products that support the milling, canning,
leather, and jute industries. Agricultural products are exported primarily
to South Africa. Proceeds from membership in a common customs union with
South Africa form the majority of government revenue. Although drought has
decreased agricultural activity over the past few years, completion of a
major hydropower facility in January 1998 now permits the sale of water to
South Africa, generating royalties for Lesotho. The pace of privatization
has increased in recent years. In December 1999, the government embarked
on a nine-month IMF staff-monitored program aimed at structural adjustment
and stabilization of macroeconomic fundamentals. The government is in
the process of applying for a three-year successor program with the IMF
under its Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility. Lesotho has a marked
inequality in income distribution and serious unemployment/underemployment
problems that will not yield to short-run solutions.

Background:  Founded in 963, Luxembourg became a grand duchy in 1815
and an independent state under the Netherlands. It lost more than half
of its territory to Belgium in 1839, but gained a larger measure of
autonomy. Full independence was attained in 1867. Overrun by Germany in
both World Wars, it ended its neutrality in 1948 when it entered into
the Benelux Customs Union and when it joined NATO the following year.
In 1957, Luxembourg became one of the six founding countries of the
European Economic Community (later the European Union) and in 1999 it

Economy Luxembourg

Economy - overview:  This stable, high-income economy features solid
growth, low inflation, and low unemployment. The industrial sector,
initially dominated by steel, has become increasingly diversified to
include chemicals, rubber, and other products. Growth in the financial
sector has more than compensated for the decline in steel. Services,
especially banking, account for a substantial proportion of the
economy. Agriculture is based on small family-owned farms. The economy
depends on foreign and trans-border workers for 30% of its labor
force. Although Luxembourg, like all EU members, has suffered from the
global economic slump, the country has maintained a fairly robust growth
rate. On 1 January 2002, Luxembourg - together with 11 of its EU partners
- began to replace its circulating national currency with the euro.

Libya

Introduction

Libya

Background:  Since he took power in a 1969 military coup, Col. Muammar Abu
Minyar al-QADHAFI has espoused his own political system - a combination
of socialism and Islam - which he calls the Third International
Theory. Viewing himself as a revolutionary leader, he used oil funds
during the 1970s and 1980s to promote his ideology outside Libya,
even supporting subversives and terrorists abroad to hasten the end of
Marxism and capitalism. Libyan military adventures failed, e.g., the
prolonged foray of Libyan troops into the Aozou Strip in northern Chad
was finally repulsed in 1987. Libyan support for terrorism decreased
after UN sanctions were imposed in 1992. Those sanctions were suspended
in April 1999.

Economy Libya

Economy - overview:  The socialist-oriented economy depends primarily upon
revenues from the oil sector, which contributes practically all export
earnings and about one-quarter of GDP. These oil revenues and a small
population give Libya one of the highest per capita GDPs in Africa, but
little of this income flows down to the lower orders of society. Import
restrictions and inefficient resource allocations have led to periodic
shortages of basic goods and foodstuffs. The nonoil manufacturing and
construction sectors, which account for about 20% of GDP, have expanded
from processing mostly agricultural products to include the production
of petrochemicals, iron, steel, and aluminum. Climatic conditions and
poor soils severely limit agricultural output, and Libya imports about
75% of its food.  Higher oil prices in 1999 and 2000 led to an increase
in export revenues, which improved macroeconomic balances and helped
to stimulate the economy. The suspension of UN sanctions in 1999 also
boosted growth. Libya's January 2002 51% devaluation of the official
exchange rate of the dinar is another fiscal plus, although it will also
bring higher inflation.

Madagascar

Background:  Formerly an independent kingdom, Madagascar became a French
colony in 1886, but regained its independence in 1960. During 1992-93,
free presidential and National Assembly elections were held, ending 17
years of single-party rule. In 1997, in the second presidential race,
Didier RATSIRAKA, the leader during the 1970s and 1980s, was returned
to the presidency. The 2001 presidential election was contested between
the followers of Didier RATSIRAKA and Marc RAVALOMANANA, nearly causing
secession of half of the country. In April 2002 the High Constitutional
Court announced RAVALOMANANA the winner.

Economy Madagascar

Economy - overview:  Madagascar faces problems of chronic malnutrition,
underfunded health and education facilities, a roughly 3% annual
population growth rate, and severe loss of forest cover, accompanied by
erosion. Agriculture, including fishing and forestry, is the mainstay
of the economy, accounting for one-third of GDP and contributing more
than 70% to export earnings. Industry features textile manufacturing and
the processing of agricultural products. Growth in output in 1992-97
averaged less than the growth rate of the population. Growth has been
held back by antigovernment strikes and demonstrations, a decline in
world coffee prices, and the erratic commitment of the government to
economic reform. The extent of government reforms, outside financial aid,
and foreign investment will be key determinants of future growth.

Economy Martinique

Economy - overview:  The economy is based on sugarcane, bananas, tourism,
and light industry. Agriculture accounts for about 6% of GDP and the
small industrial sector for 11%. Sugar production has declined, with
most of the sugarcane now used for the production of rum. Banana exports
are increasing, going mostly to France. The bulk of meat, vegetable,
and grain requirements must be imported, contributing to a chronic
trade deficit that requires large annual transfers of aid from France.
Tourism, which employs more than 11,000 people, has become more important
than agricultural exports as a source of foreign exchange. The majority
of the work force is employed in the service sector and in administration.

Economy Macau

Economy - overview:  Macau's economy two years after reversion to China
remains one of the most open in the world, according to the World
Trade Organization. The government collects no duty on imports and
sets no restrictions on exports beyond those required by international
agreements. The territory's net exports of goods and services account
for 35% of GDP, with tourism and apparel exports as the mainstays. The
territory therefore has been hit hard by the 2001 downturn in its key US
and EU export markets. Tourism remained strong, however, driven by a surge
in visitors from mainland China. In response to the expected contraction
of the economy in 2002, the government has announced a stimulative
income tax cut and public works program that will push the budget into
deficit. China already has extended support by easing restrictions on
travel to Macau and is proposing a China-Hong Kong-Macau free trade
area. China's economic weight is increasingly felt, with the mainland
now holding more than 50% of assets in the financial, real estate,
and construction sectors.  Mainlanders, however, have been excluded
from bidding on the gambling industry licenses that Macau is offering
to break up the territory's four-decade-old gambling monopoly. Gambling
taxes account for up to 60% of revenue, and the government with Beijing's
backing intends to revitalize the industry.

Moldova

Introduction

Moldova

Background:  Formerly ruled by Romania, Moldova became part of the
Soviet Union at the close of World War II. Although independent from
the USSR since 1991, Russian forces have remained on Moldovan territory
east of the Dniester River supporting the Slavic majority population,
mostly Ukrainians and Russians, who have proclaimed a "Transnistria"
republic. One of the poorest nations in Europe, Moldova became the first
former Soviet state to elect a Communist as its president in 2001.

Economy Moldova

Economy - overview:  Moldova enjoys a favorable climate and good
farmland but has no major mineral deposits. As a result, the economy
depends heavily on agriculture, featuring fruits, vegetables, wine,
and tobacco. Moldova must import all of its supplies of oil, coal, and
natural gas, largely from Russia. Energy shortages contributed to sharp
production declines after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. As
part of an ambitious reform effort, Moldova introduced a convertible
currency, freed all prices, stopped issuing preferential credits to state
enterprises, backed steady land privatization, removed export controls,
and freed interest rates. Yet these efforts could not offset the impact
of political and economic difficulties, both internal and regional. In
1998, the economic troubles of Russia, by far Moldova's leading trade
partner, were a major cause of the 8.6% drop in GDP. In 1999, GDP fell
again, by 4.4%, the fifth drop in the past seven years; exports were
down, and energy supplies continued to be erratic. Following the return
to positive GDP growth in 2000 (1.9%), Moldova experienced strong 6.1%
rise in GDP in 2001, driven by a marked improvement in industry and a 20%
improvement in agriculture.

Mongolia

Introduction

Mongolia

Background:  The Mongols entered history in the 13th century when under
GENGHIS KHAN they conquered a huge Eurasian empire. After his death
the empire was divided into several powerful Mongol states, but these
broke apart in the 14th century. The Mongols eventually retired to their
original steppe homelands and came under Chinese rule. Mongolia won its
independence in 1921 with Soviet backing. A Communist regime was installed
in 1924. During the early 1990s, the ex-Communist Mongolian People's
Revolutionary Party (MPRP) gradually yielded its monopoly on power to the
Democratic Union Coalition (DUC), which defeated the MPRP in a national
election in 1996. Over the next four years the DUC put forward a number
of key reforms to modernize the economy and democratize the political
system. However, the former Communists were a strong opposition that
stalled additional restructuring and made implementation difficult. In
2000, the MPRP won an overwhelming victory in the legislature - with 72
of the 76 seats - and completely reshuffled the government. While it
continues many of the reform policies, the MPRP is focusing on social
welfare and public order priorities.

Environment - current issues:  limited natural fresh water resources
in some areas; policies of the former Communist regime promoting
rapid urbanization and industrial growth have raised concerns about
their negative effects on the environment; the burning of soft coal
in power plants and the lack of enforcement of environmental laws have
severely polluted the air in Ulaanbaatar; deforestation, overgrazing,
the converting of virgin land to agricultural production have increased
soil erosion from wind and rain; desertification and mining activities
have also had a deleterious effect on the environment

Economy Mongolia

Economy - overview:  Economic activity traditionally has been based
on agriculture and breeding of livestock. Mongolia also has extensive
mineral deposits: copper, coal, molybdenum, tin, tungsten, and gold
account for a large part of industrial production. Soviet assistance,
at its height one-third of GDP, disappeared almost overnight in 1990-91,
at the time of the dismantlement of the USSR. Mongolia was driven into
deep recession, prolonged by the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party's
(MPRP) reluctance to undertake serious economic reform. The Democratic
Coalition (DC) government has embraced free-market economics, easing price
controls, liberalizing domestic and international trade, and attempting
to restructure the banking system and the energy sector. Major domestic
privatization programs were undertaken, as well as the fostering of
foreign investment through international tender of the oil distribution
company, a leading cashmere company, and banks. Reform was held back by
the ex-Communist MPRP opposition and by the political instability brought
about through four successive governments under the DC.  Economic growth
picked up in 1997-99 after stalling in 1996 due to a series of natural
disasters and declines in world prices of copper and cashmere. In August
and September 1999, the economy suffered from a temporary Russian ban
on exports of oil and oil products, and Mongolia remains vulnerable
in this sector. Mongolia joined the World Trade Organization (WTrO)
in 1997. The international donor community pledged over $300 million
per year at the last Consultative Group Meeting, held in Ulaanbaatar
in June 1999. The MPRP government, elected in July 2000, is anxious to
improve the investment climate; it must also deal with a heavy burden
of external debt. Falling prices for Mongolia's mainly primary sector
exports, widespread opposition to privatization, and adverse effects of
weather on agriculture in early 2000 and 2001 restrained real GDP growth
in 2000-01.

Economy Montserrat

Economy - overview:  Severe volcanic activity, which began in July 1995,
has put a damper on this small, open economy. A catastrophic eruption in
June 1997 closed the airports and seaports, causing further economic and
social dislocation. Two-thirds of the 12,000 inhabitants fled the island.
Some began to return in 1998, but lack of housing limited the number. The
agriculture sector continued to be affected by the lack of suitable land
for farming and the destruction of crops.  Prospects for the economy
depend largely on developments in relation to the volcano and on public
sector construction activity.  The UK has launched a three-year $122.8
million aid program to help reconstruct the economy. Half of the island
is expected to remain uninhabitable for another decade.

Economy Malawi

Economy - overview:  Landlocked Malawi ranks among the world's least
developed countries. The economy is predominately agricultural,
with about 90% of the population living in rural areas. Agriculture
accounts for 40% of GDP and 88% of export revenues. The economy depends
on substantial inflows of economic assistance from the IMF, the World
Bank, and individual donor nations. In late 2000, Malawi was approved
for relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) program. The
government faces strong challenges, e.g., to fully develop a market
economy, to improve educational facilities, to face up to environmental
problems, and to deal with the rapidly growing problem of HIV/AIDS.
The performance of the tobacco sector is key to short-term growth.

Macedonia, The Former Yugoslav Republic of

Introduction

Macedonia, The Former Yugoslav Republic of

Background:  International recognition of The Former Yugoslav Republic
of Macedonia's (F.Y.R.O.M.) independence from Yugoslavia in 1991
was delayed by Greece's objection to the new state's use of what it
considered a Hellenic name and symbols. Greece finally lifted its
trade blockade in 1995, and the two countries agreed to normalize
relations, despite continued disagreement over F.Y.R.O.M.'s use of
"Macedonia." F.Y.R.O.M.'s large Albanian minority, an ethnic Albanian
armed insurgency in F.Y.R.O.M. in 2001, and the status of neighboring
Kosovo continue to be sources of ethnic tension.

Economy Macedonia, The Former Yugoslav Republic of

Economy - overview:  At independence in November 1991, Macedonia was the
least developed of the Yugoslav republics, producing a mere 5% of the
total federal output of goods and services. The collapse of Yugoslavia
ended transfer payments from the center and eliminated advantages from
inclusion in a de facto free trade area. An absence of infrastructure, UN
sanctions on Yugoslavia, one of its largest markets, and a Greek economic
embargo over a dispute about the country's constitutional name and flag
hindered economic growth until 1996. GDP subsequently rose each year
through 2000. However, the leadership's commitment to economic reform,
free trade, and regional integration was undermined by the ethnic Albanian
insurgency of 2001. The economy shrank about 4% because of decreased
trade, intermittent border closures, increased deficit spending on
security needs, and investor uncertainty. The international community
hopes to restart growth with a donors' conference in 2002.

Mali

Introduction

Mali

Background:  The Sudanese Republic and Senegal became independent of
France in 1960 as the Mali Federation. When Senegal withdrew after only a
few months, the Sudanese Republic was renamed Mali. Rule by dictatorship
was brought to a close in 1991 with a transitional government, and in 1992
when Mali's first democratic presidential election was held.  Since his
reelection in 1997, President KONARE continued to push through political
and economic reforms and to fight corruption. In 1999 he indicated he
would not run for a third term, in keeping with the Malian constitution's
two-term limit.

Economy Mali

Economy - overview:  Mali is among the poorest countries in the world,
with 65% of its land area desert or semidesert. Economic activity is
largely confined to the riverine area irrigated by the Niger. About
10% of the population is nomadic and some 70% of the labor force is
engaged in farming and fishing.  Industrial activity is concentrated
on processing farm commodities.  Mali is heavily dependent on foreign
aid and vulnerable to fluctuations in world prices for cotton, its main
export. In 1997, the government continued its successful implementation
of an IMF-recommended structural adjustment program that is helping
the economy grow, diversify, and attract foreign investment. Mali's
adherence to economic reform and the 50% devaluation of the African
franc in January 1994 have pushed up economic growth to a sturdy 5%
average in 1996-2000. In 2001, GDP decreased by 1.2% mainly due to a 50%
drop in cotton production in 2000-01.

Economy - overview:  Monaco, situated on the French Mediterranean
coast, is a popular resort, attracting tourists to its casino
and pleasant climate. In 2001, a major new construction project
will extend the pier used by cruise ships in the main harbor. The
Principality has successfully sought to diversify into services and
small, high-value-added, nonpolluting industries. The state has no
income tax and low business taxes and thrives as a tax haven both for
individuals who have established residence and for foreign companies
that have set up businesses and offices. The state retains monopolies
in a number of sectors, including tobacco, the telephone network, and
the postal service.  Living standards are high, roughly comparable to
those in prosperous French metropolitan areas. Monaco does not publish

Economy Morocco

Economy - overview:  Morocco faces the problems typical of developing
countries - restraining government spending, reducing constraints on
private activity and foreign trade, and achieving sustainable economic
growth. Following structural adjustment programs supported by the IMF,
World Bank, and the Paris Club, the dirham is now fully convertible for
current account transactions, and reforms of the financial sector have
been implemented. Droughts depressed activity in the key agricultural
sector and contributed to a stagnant economy in 1999 and 2000.  During
that time, however, Morocco reported large foreign exchange inflows from
the sale of a mobile telephone license and partial privatization of the
state-owned telecommunications company.  Favorable rainfall in 2001 led
to a growth of 5%. Formidable long-term challenges include: servicing
the external debt; preparing the economy for freer trade with the EU;
and improving education and attracting foreign investment to boost living
standards and job prospects for Morocco's youth.

foreign investment and has earned one of Africa's highest per capita
incomes. Recent poor weather and declining sugar prices have slowed
economic growth leading to some protests over standards of living in

Economy Mauritius

Economy - overview:  Since independence in 1968, Mauritius has developed
from a low-income, agriculturally based economy to a middle-income
diversified economy with growing industrial, financial, and tourist
sectors. For most of the period, annual growth has been in the order of 5%
to 6%. This remarkable achievement has been reflected in more equitable
income distribution, increased life expectancy, lowered infant mortality,
and a much improved infrastructure. Sugarcane is grown on about 90%
of the cultivated land area and accounts for 25% of export earnings. The
government's development strategy centers on foreign investment. Mauritius
has attracted more than 9,000 offshore entities, many aimed at commerce
in India and South Africa, and investment in the banking sector alone
has reached over $1 billion.  Mauritius, with its strong textile sector
and responsible fiscal management, was well-poised to take advantage of
the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA).

Midway Islands

Introduction

Midway Islands

Background:  The US took formal possession of the islands in 1867. The
laying of the trans-Pacific cable, which passed through the islands,
brought the first residents in 1903. Between 1935 and 1947, Midway was
used as a refueling stop for trans-Pacific flights. The US naval victory
over a Japanese fleet off Midway in 1942 was one of the turning points
of World War II. The islands continued to serve as a naval station until
closed in 1993. Today the islands are a national wildlife refuge. From
1996 to 2001 the refuge was open to the public. It is now temporarily
closed.

Mauritania

Introduction

Mauritania

Background:  Independent from France in 1960, Mauritania annexed the
southern third of the former Spanish Sahara (now Western Sahara) in
1976, but relinquished it after three years of raids by the Polisario
guerrilla front seeking independence for the territory. Opposition
parties were legalized and a new constitution approved in 1991. Two
multiparty presidential elections since then were widely seen as flawed,
but October 2001 legislative and municipal elections were generally
free and open. Mauritania remains, in reality, a one-party state.
The country continues to experience ethnic tensions between its black
minority population and the dominant Maur (Arab-Berber) populace.

Economy Mauritania

Economy - overview:  Half the population still depends on agriculture
and livestock for a livelihood, even though most of the nomads and many
subsistence farmers were forced into the cities by recurrent droughts
in the 1970s and 1980s.  Mauritania has extensive deposits of iron
ore, which account for half of total exports. The decline in world
demand for this ore, however, has led to cutbacks in production. The
nation's coastal waters are among the richest fishing areas in the
world, but overexploitation by foreigners threatens this key source
of revenue. The country's first deepwater port opened near Nouakchott
in 1986. In the past, drought and economic mismanagement resulted in
a buildup of foreign debt. In February, 2000, Mauritania qualified for
debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative
and in December 2001 received strong support from donor and lending
countries at a triennial Consultative Group review. Mauritania withdrew
its membership in the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)
in 2000 and subsequently increased commercial ties with Arab Maghreb
Union members Morocco and Tunisia, most notably in telecommunications. In
2001, exploratory oil wells in tracts 80 km offshore indicated potential
viable extraction at current world oil prices. However, the refinery in
Nouadhibou historically has not exceeded 20% of its distillation capacity,
and it handled no crude in the year 2000. A new Investment Code approved
in December 2001 improved the opportunities for direct foreign investment.

Economy Malta

Economy - overview:  Major resources are limestone, a favorable geographic
location, and a productive labor force. Malta produces only about 20%
of its food needs, has limited freshwater supplies, and has no domestic
energy sources. The economy is dependent on foreign trade, manufacturing
(especially electronics and textiles), and tourism. Malta is privatizing
state-controlled firms and liberalizing markets in order to prepare for
membership in the European Union and is expected to complete EU accession
negotiations in 2002. The island is divided politically, however, over
the question of joining the EU.

Economy Maldives

Economy - overview:  Tourism, Maldives largest industry, accounts
for 20% of GDP and more than 60% of the Maldives' foreign exchange
receipts. Over 90% of government tax revenue comes from import duties
and tourism-related taxes. Almost 400,000 tourists visited the islands in
1998. Fishing is a second leading sector. The Maldivian Government began
an economic reform program in 1989 initially by lifting import quotas
and opening some exports to the private sector. Subsequently, it has
liberalized regulations to allow more foreign investment. Agriculture and
manufacturing continue to play a minor role in the economy, constrained by
the limited availability of cultivable land and the shortage of domestic
labor. Most staple foods must be imported.  Industry, which consists
mainly of garment production, boat building, and handicrafts, accounts
for about 18% of GDP. Maldivian authorities worry about the impact of
erosion and possible global warming on their low-lying country; 80%
of the area is one meter or less above sea level.

Mexico

Introduction

Mexico

Background:  The site of advanced Amerindian civilizations, Mexico came
under Spanish rule for three centuries before achieving independence
early in the 19th century.  A devaluation of the peso in late 1994 threw
Mexico into economic turmoil, triggering the worst recession in over half
a century. The nation continues to make an impressive recovery. Ongoing
economic and social concerns include low real wages, underemployment for
a large segment of the population, inequitable income distribution, and
few advancement opportunities for the largely Amerindian population in the
impoverished southern states. Elections held in July 2000 marked the first
time since the 1910 Mexican Revolution that the opposition defeated the
party in government, the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). Vicente
FOX of the National Action Party (PAN) was sworn in on 1 December 2000
as the first chief executive elected in free and fair elections.

Economy Mexico

Economy - overview:  Mexico has a free market economy with a mixture of
modern and outmoded industry and agriculture, increasingly dominated by
the private sector. Recent administrations have expanded competition
in seaports, railroads, telecommunications, electricity, natural
gas distribution, and airports. Income distribution remains highly
unequal. Trade with the US and Canada has tripled since the implementation
of NAFTA in 1994. Following 6.9% growth in 2000, real GDP fell 0.3% in
2001, with the US slowdown the principal cause. Positive developments in
2001 included a drop in inflation to 6.5%, a sharp fall in interest rates,
and a strong peso that appreciated 5% against the dollar.  Mexico City
implemented free trade agreements with Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador,
and the European Free Trade Area in 2001, putting more than 90% of
trade under free trade agreements. Foreign direct investment reached
$25 billion in 2001, of which $12.5 billion came from the purchase of
Mexico's second largest bank, Banamex, by Citigroup.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)



What's New

- Country information has been updated as of 18 December 2008.

- In the People category, two new fields provide information on
education in terms of opportunity and resources. "School Life
Expectancy" is an estimate of the total number of years of schooling
(primary to tertiary) that a child can expect to receive, assuming
that the probability of his or her being enrolled in school at any
particular future age is equal to the current enrollment ratio at
that age. "Education expenditures" provides an estimate of the public
expenditure on education as a percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

- In order to help policymakers understand the nature and global
dimensions of the current financial crisis, The World Factbook has
added five new fields to the Economy category. "Central bank discount
rate" provides the annualized interest rate a country's central bank
charges commercial, depository banks for loans to meet temporary
shortages of funds. "Commercial bank prime lending rate" provides a
simple average of annualized interest rates commercial banks charge
on new loans, denominated in the national currency, to their most
credit-worthy customers. "Stock of money" also known as "M1," comprises
the total quantity of currency in circulation (notes and coins) plus
demand deposits denominated in the national currency, held by nonbank
financial institutions, state and local governments, nonfinancial
public enterprises, and the private sector of the economy. "Stock of
quasi money" comprises the total quantity of time and savings deposits
denominated in the national currency, held by nonbank financial
institutions, state and local governments, nonfinancial public
enterprises, and the private sector of the economy. When added together
with "M1" the total money supply is known as "M2." "Stock of domestic
credit" is the total quantity of credit, denominated in the domestic
currency, provided by banks to nonbanking institutions.

- In the Geography category, two new fields focus on the increasingly
vital resource of water: "Total renewable water resources" and
"Freshwater withdrawal."

- Revision of some individual country maps, first introduced in the
2001 edition, is continued in this edition. Several regional maps have
also been updated to reflect boundary changes and place name spelling
changes.

Factbook fields with Rank Order pages are easily identified with a
small bar chart icon to the right of the data field title.

Not all Rank Order pages include the same number of entries because
information for a particular field is not available for all countries.
In addition, not all data fields are suitable for displaying as Rank
Order pages, such as those containing textual information. Textual
information is more readily viewed by clicking on the Field Listing
icon  next to the Data field title. The other icon next to the data
field title provides the definition of the field.

All of the 'Rank Order' pages can be downloaded as tab-delimited data
files and can be opened in other applications such as spreadsheets and
databases. To save a Rank Order page in a spreadsheet, first click on
the 'Download Datafile' choice above the Rank Order page you selected;
then, at the top of your browser window, click on 'File' and 'Save As'.
After saving the file, open the spreadsheet, find the saved file, and
'Open' it.

Additional Rank Order pages being considered for future updates of the
Factbook Web site include:

Notes and Definitions


In addition to the regular information updates, The World Factbook 2008
features several new additions. In the Geography category, two new
fields focus on the increasingly vital resource of water: "Total
renewable water resources" and "Freshwater withdrawal."

In the Economy category, the Factbook has added three fields: "Stock of
direct foreign investment - at home", "Stock of direct foreign
investment - abroad", and "Market value of publicly traded shares."
Additionally, the data for GDP at purchasing power parity (PPP) has
been rebased using new PPP conversion rates, benchmarked to the year
2005, which were released on 17 December 2007 by the International
Comparison Program (ICP). The 2005 PPP data replace previous estimates,
many from studies dating to 1993 or earlier. The preliminary ICP report
provides estimates of internationally comparable price levels and the
relative purchasing power of currencies for 146 countries. The 2005
benchmark revises downward the size of the world economy in PPP terms
from the previous estimates, and changes the relative sizes of many of
the world's economies.

Concise descriptions of the major religions mentioned in the Factbook
have been added to the Notes and Definitions. France 's redesignation
of some of its overseas possessions caused the five former Indian Ocean
island possessions making up Iles Eparses to be incorporated into the
French Southern and Antarctic Lands, while two new Caribbean entities,
St. Barthelemy and St. Martin, were created.

Revision of some individual country maps, first introduced in the 2001
edition, is continued in this edition. The revised maps include
elevation extremes and a partial geographic grid. Several regional maps
have also been updated to reflect boundary changes and place name
spelling changes.

Abbreviations:  This information is included in Appendix A:
Abbreviations, which includes all abbreviations and acronyms used in
the Factbook, with their expansions.

Acronyms:  An acronym is an abbreviation coined from the initial letter
of each successive word in a term or phrase. In general, an acronym
made up solely from the first letter of the major words in the expanded
form is rendered in all capital letters (NATO from North Atlantic
Treaty Organization; an exception would be ASEAN for Association of
Southeast Asian Nations). In general, an acronym made up of more than
the first letter of the major words in the expanded form is rendered
with only an initial capital letter (Comsat from Communications
Satellite Corporation; an exception would be NAM from Nonaligned
Movement). Hybrid forms are sometimes used to distinguish between
initially identical terms (ICC for International Chamber of Commerce
and ICCt for International Criminal Court).

Administrative divisions:  This entry generally gives the numbers,
designatory terms, and first-order administrative divisions as approved
by the US Board on Geographic Names (BGN). Changes that have been
reported but not yet acted on by the BGN are noted.

Age structure:  This entry provides the distribution of the population
according to age. Information is included by sex and age group (0-14
years, 15-64 years, 65 years and over). The age structure of a
population affects a nation's key socioeconomic issues. Countries with
young populations (high percentage under age 15) need to invest more in
schools, while countries with older populations (high percentage ages
65 and over) need to invest more in the health sector. The age
structure can also be used to help predict potential political issues.
For example, the rapid growth of a young adult population unable to
find employment can lead to unrest.

Agriculture - products:  This entry is an ordered listing of major
crops and products starting with the most important.

Airports:  This entry gives the total number of airports or airfields
recognizable from the air. The runway(s) may be paved (concrete or
asphalt surfaces) or unpaved (grass, earth, sand, or gravel surfaces)
but may include closed or abandoned installations. Airports or
airfields that are no longer recognizable (overgrown, no facilities,
etc.) are not included. Note that not all airports have accommodations
for refueling, maintenance, or air traffic control.

Airports - with paved runways:  This entry gives the total number of
airports with paved runways (concrete or asphalt surfaces) by length.
For airports with more than one runway, only the longest runway is
included according to the following five groups - (1) over 3,047 m, (2)
2,438 to 3,047 m, (3) 1,524 to 2,437 m, (4) 914 to 1,523 m, and (5)
under 914 m. Only airports with usable runways are included in this
listing. Not all airports have facilities for refueling, maintenance,
or air traffic control.

Airports - with unpaved runways:  This entry gives the total number of
airports with unpaved runways (grass, dirt, sand, or gravel surfaces)
by length. For airports with more than one runway, only the longest
runway is included according to the following five groups - (1) over
3,047 m, (2) 2,438 to 3,047 m, (3) 1,524 to 2,437 m, (4) 914 to 1,523
m, and (5) under 914 m. Only airports with usable runways are included
in this listing. Not all airports have facilities for refueling,
maintenance, or air traffic control.

Appendixes:  This section includes Factbook-related material by topic.

Area:  This entry includes three subfields. Total area is the sum of
all land and water areas delimited by international boundaries and/or
coastlines. Land area is the aggregate of all surfaces delimited by
international boundaries and/or coastlines, excluding inland water
bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers). Water area is the sum of the
surfaces of all inland water bodies, such as lakes, reservoirs, or
rivers, as delimited by international boundaries and/or coastlines.

Area - comparative:  This entry provides an area comparison based on
total area equivalents. Most entities are compared with the entire US
or one of the 50 states based on area measurements (1990 revised)
provided by the US Bureau of the Census. The smaller entities are
compared with Washington, DC (178 sq km, 69 sq mi) or The Mall in
Washington, DC (0.59 sq km, 0.23 sq mi, 146 acres).

Background:  This entry usually highlights major historic events and
current issues and may include a statement about one or two key future
trends.

Birth rate:  This entry gives the average annual number of births
during a year per 1,000 persons in the population at midyear; also
known as crude birth rate. The birth rate is usually the dominant
factor in determining the rate of population growth. It depends on both
the level of fertility and the age structure of the population.

Budget:  This entry includes revenues, expenditures, and capital
expenditures. These figures are calculated on an exchange rate basis,
i.e., not in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.

Capital:  This entry gives the name of the seat of government, its
geographic coordinates, the time difference relative to Coordinated
Universal Time (UTC) and the time observed in Washington, DC, and, if
applicable, information on daylight saving time (DST). Where
appropriate, a special note has been added to highlight those countries
that have multiple time zones.

Central bank discount rate:  This entry provides the annualized
interest rate a country's central bank charges commercial, depository
banks for loans to meet temporary shortages of funds.

Climate:  This entry includes a brief description of typical weather
regimes throughout the year.

Coastline:  This entry gives the total length of the boundary between
the land area (including islands) and the sea.

Commercial bank prime lending rate:  This entry provides a simple
average of annualized interest rates commercial banks charge on new
loans, denominated in the national currency, to their most credit-
worthy customers.

Communications:  This category deals with the means of exchanging
information and includes the telephone, radio, television, and Internet
host entries.

Communications - note:  This entry includes miscellaneous
communications information of significance not included elsewhere.

Constitution:  This entry includes the dates of adoption, revisions,
and major amendments.

Coordinated Universal Time (UTC):  UTC is the international atomic time
scale that serves as the basis of timekeeping for most of the world.
The hours, minutes, and seconds expressed by UTC represent the time of
day at the Prime Meridian (0 deg. longitude) located near Greenwich,
England as reckoned from midnight. UTC is calculated by the Bureau
International des Poids et Measures (BIPM) in Sevres, France. The BIPM
averages data collected from more than 200 atomic time and frequency
standards located at about 50 laboratories worldwide. UTC is the basis
for all civil time with the Earth divided into time zones expressed as
positive or negative differences from UTC. UTC is also referred to as
"Zulu time." See the Standard Time Zones of the World map included with
the Reference Maps.

Country data codes:  see Data codes.

Country map:  Most versions of the Factbook provide a country map in
color. The maps were produced from the best information available at
the time of preparation. Names and/or boundaries may have changed
subsequently.

Country name:  This entry includes all forms of the country's name
approved by the US Board on Geographic Names (Italy is used as an
example): conventional long form (Italian Republic), conventional short
form (Italy), local long form (Repubblica Italiana), local short form
(Italia), former (Kingdom of Italy), as well as the abbreviation. Also
see the Terminology note.

Crude oil:  See entry for oil.

Current account balance:  This entry records a country's net trade in
goods and services, plus net earnings from rents, interest, profits,
and dividends, and net transfer payments (such as pension funds and
worker remittances) to and from the rest of the world during the period
specified. These figures are calculated on an exchange rate basis,
i.e., not in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.

Data codes:  This information is presented in Appendix D: Cross-
Reference List of Country Data Codes and Appendix E: Cross-Reference
List of Hydrographic Data Codes.

Date of information:  In general, information available as of 1 January
2007 was used in the preparation of this edition.

Daylight Saving Time (DST):  This entry is included for those entities
that have adopted a policy of adjusting the official local time
forward, usually one hour, from Standard Time during summer months.
Such policies are most common in mid-latitude regions.

Death rate:  This entry gives the average annual number of deaths
during a year per 1,000 population at midyear; also known as crude
death rate. The death rate, while only a rough indicator of the
mortality situation in a country, accurately indicates the current
mortality impact on population growth. This indicator is significantly
affected by age distribution, and most countries will eventually show a
rise in the overall death rate, in spite of continued decline in
mortality at all ages, as declining fertility results in an aging
population.

Debt - external:  This entry gives the total public and private debt
owed to nonresidents repayable in foreign currency, goods, or services.
These figures are calculated on an exchange rate basis, i.e., not in
purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.

Dependency status:  This entry describes the formal relationship
between a particular nonindependent entity and an independent state.

Dependent areas:  This entry contains an alphabetical listing of all
nonindependent entities associated in some way with a particular
independent state.

Diplomatic representation:  The US Government has diplomatic relations
with 189 independent states, including 187 of the 192 UN members
(excluded UN members are Bhutan, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and the US
itself). In addition, the US has diplomatic relations with 2
independent states that are not in the UN, the Holy See and Kosovo, as
well as with the EU.

Diplomatic representation from the US:  This entry includes the chief
of mission, embassy address, mailing address, telephone number, FAX
number, branch office locations, consulate general locations, and
consulate locations.

Diplomatic representation in the US:  This entry includes the chief of
mission, chancery, telephone, FAX, consulate general locations, and
consulate locations.

Disputes - international:  This entry includes a wide variety of
situations that range from traditional bilateral boundary disputes to
unilateral claims of one sort or another. Information regarding
disputes over international terrestrial and maritime boundaries has
been reviewed by the US Department of State. References to other
situations involving borders or frontiers may also be included, such as
resource disputes, geopolitical questions, or irredentist issues;
however, inclusion does not necessarily constitute official acceptance
or recognition by the US Government.

Distribution of family income - Gini index:  This index measures the
degree of inequality in the distribution of family income in a country.
The index is calculated from the Lorenz curve, in which cumulative
family income is plotted against the number of families arranged from
the poorest to the richest. The index is the ratio of (a) the area
between a country's Lorenz curve and the 45 degree helping line to (b)
the entire triangular area under the 45 degree line. The more nearly
equal a country's income distribution, the closer its Lorenz curve to
the 45 degree line and the lower its Gini index, e.g., a Scandinavian
country with an index of 25. The more unequal a country's income
distribution, the farther its Lorenz curve from the 45 degree line and
the higher its Gini index, e.g., a Sub-Saharan country with an index of
50. If income were distributed with perfect equality, the Lorenz curve
would coincide with the 45 degree line and the index would be zero; if
income were distributed with perfect inequality, the Lorenz curve would
coincide with the horizontal axis and the right vertical axis and the
index would be 100.

Economy:  This category includes the entries dealing with the size,
development, and management of productive resources, i.e., land, labor,
and capital.

Economy - overview:  This entry briefly describes the type of economy,
including the degree of market orientation, the level of economic
development, the most important natural resources, and the unique areas
of specialization. It also characterizes major economic events and
policy changes in the most recent 12 months and may include a statement
about one or two key future macroeconomic trends.

Education expenditures:  This entry provides the public expenditure on
education as a percent of GDP

Electricity - consumption:  This entry consists of total electricity
generated annually plus imports and minus exports, expressed in
kilowatt-hours. The discrepancy between the amount of electricity
generated and/or imported and the amount consumed and/or exported is
accounted for as loss in transmission and distribution.

Electricity - exports:  This entry is the total exported electricity in
kilowatt-hours.

Electricity - imports:  This entry is the total imported electricity in
kilowatt-hours.

Electricity - production:  This entry is the annual electricity
generated expressed in kilowatt-hours. The discrepancy between the
amount of electricity generated and/or imported and the amount consumed
and/or exported is accounted for as loss in transmission and
distribution.

Elevation extremes:  This entry includes both the highest point and the
lowest point.

Entities:  Some of the independent states, dependencies, areas of
special sovereignty, and governments included in this publication are
not independent, and others are not officially recognized by the US
Government. "Independent state" refers to a people politically
organized into a sovereign state with a definite territory.
"Dependencies" and "areas of special sovereignty" refer to a broad
category of political entities that are associated in some way with an
independent state. "Country" names used in the table of contents or for
page headings are usually the short-form names as approved by the US
Board on Geographic Names and may include independent states,
dependencies, and areas of special sovereignty, or other geographic
entities. There are a total of 266 separate geographic entities in The

Environment - current issues:  This entry lists the most pressing and
important environmental problems. The following terms and abbreviations
are used throughout the entry:

Acidification - the lowering of soil and water pH due to acid
precipitation and deposition usually through precipitation; this
process disrupts ecosystem nutrient flows and may kill freshwater fish
and plants dependent on more neutral or alkaline conditions (see acid
rain).

Acid rain - characterized as containing harmful levels of sulfur
dioxide or nitrogen oxide; acid rain is damaging and potentially deadly
to the earth's fragile ecosystems; acidity is measured using the pH
scale where 7 is neutral, values greater than 7 are considered
alkaline, and values below 5.6 are considered acid precipitation; note
- a pH of 2.4 (the acidity of vinegar) has been measured in rainfall in
New England.

Aerosol - a collection of airborne particles dispersed in a gas, smoke,
or fog.

Afforestation - converting a bare or agricultural space by planting
trees and plants; reforestation involves replanting trees on areas that
have been cut or destroyed by fire.

Asbestos - a naturally occurring soft fibrous mineral commonly used in
fireproofing materials and considered to be highly carcinogenic in
particulate form.

Biodiversity - also biological diversity; the relative number of
species, diverse in form and function, at the genetic, organism,
community, and ecosystem level; loss of biodiversity reduces an
ecosystem's ability to recover from natural or man-induced disruption.

Bio-indicators - a plant or animal species whose presence, abundance,
and health reveal the general condition of its habitat.

Biomass - the total weight or volume of living matter in a given area
or volume.

Carbon cycle - the term used to describe the exchange of carbon (in
various forms, e.g., as carbon dioxide) between the atmosphere, ocean,
terrestrial biosphere, and geological deposits.

Catchments - assemblages used to capture and retain rainwater and
runoff; an important water management technique in areas with limited
freshwater resources, such as Gibraltar.

DDT (dichloro-diphenyl-trichloro-ethane) - a colorless, odorless
insecticide that has toxic effects on most animals; the use of DDT was
banned in the US in 1972.

Defoliants - chemicals which cause plants to lose their leaves
artificially; often used in agricultural practices for weed control,
and may have detrimental impacts on human and ecosystem health.

Deforestation - the destruction of vast areas of forest (e.g.,
unsustainable forestry practices, agricultural and range land clearing,
and the over exploitation of wood products for use as fuel) without
planting new growth.

Desertification - the spread of desert-like conditions in arid or semi-
arid areas, due to overgrazing, loss of agriculturally productive
soils, or climate change.

Dredging - the practice of deepening an existing waterway; also, a
technique used for collecting bottom-dwelling marine organisms (e.g.,
shellfish) or harvesting coral, often causing significant destruction
of reef and ocean-floor ecosystems.

Drift-net fishing - done with a net, miles in extent, that is generally
anchored to a boat and left to float with the tide; often results in an
over harvesting and waste of large populations of non-commercial marine
species (by-catch) by its effect of "sweeping the ocean clean."

Ecosystems - ecological units comprised of complex communities of
organisms and their specific environments.

Effluents - waste materials, such as smoke, sewage, or industrial waste
which are released into the environment, subsequently polluting it.

Endangered species - a species that is threatened with extinction
either by direct hunting or habitat destruction.

Freshwater - water with very low soluble mineral content; sources
include lakes, streams, rivers, glaciers, and underground aquifers.

Greenhouse gas - a gas that "traps" infrared radiation in the lower
atmosphere causing surface warming; water vapor, carbon dioxide,
nitrous oxide, methane, hydrofluorocarbons, and ozone are the primary
greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere.

Groundwater - water sources found below the surface of the earth often
in naturally occurring reservoirs in permeable rock strata; the source
for wells and natural springs.

Highlands Water Project - a series of dams constructed jointly by
Lesotho and South Africa to redirect Lesotho's abundant water supply
into a rapidly growing area in South Africa; while it is the largest
infrastructure project in southern Africa, it is also the most costly
and controversial; objections to the project include claims that it
forces people from their homes, submerges farmlands, and squanders
economic resources.

Inuit Circumpolar Conference (ICC) - represents the 145,000 Inuits of
Russia, Alaska, Canada, and Greenland in international environmental
issues; a General Assembly convenes every three years to determine the
focus of the ICC; the most current concerns are long-range transport of
pollutants, sustainable development, and climate change.

Metallurgical plants - industries which specialize in the science,
technology, and processing of metals; these plants produce highly
concentrated and toxic wastes which can contribute to pollution of
ground water and air when not properly disposed.

Noxious substances - injurious, very harmful to living beings.

Overgrazing - the grazing of animals on plant material faster than it
can naturally regrow leading to the permanent loss of plant cover, a
common effect of too many animals grazing limited range land.

Ozone shield - a layer of the atmosphere composed of ozone gas (O3)
that resides approximately 25 miles above the Earth's surface and
absorbs solar ultraviolet radiation that can be harmful to living
organisms.

Poaching - the illegal killing of animals or fish, a great concern with
respect to endangered or threatened species.

Pollution - the contamination of a healthy environment by man-made
waste.

Potable water - water that is drinkable, safe to be consumed.

Salination - the process through which fresh (drinkable) water becomes
salt (undrinkable) water; hence, desalination is the reverse process;
also involves the accumulation of salts in topsoil caused by
evaporation of excessive irrigation water, a process that can
eventually render soil incapable of supporting crops.

Siltation - occurs when water channels and reservoirs become clotted
with silt and mud, a side effect of deforestation and soil erosion.

Slash-and-burn agriculture - a rotating cultivation technique in which
trees are cut down and burned in order to clear land for temporary
agriculture; the land is used until its productivity declines at which
point a new plot is selected and the process repeats; this practice is
sustainable while population levels are low and time is permitted for
regrowth of natural vegetation; conversely, where these conditions do
not exist, the practice can have disastrous consequences for the
environment.

Soil degradation - damage to the land's productive capacity because of
poor agricultural practices such as the excessive use of pesticides or
fertilizers, soil compaction from heavy equipment, or erosion of
topsoil, eventually resulting in reduced ability to produce
agricultural products.

Soil erosion - the removal of soil by the action of water or wind,
compounded by poor agricultural practices, deforestation, overgrazing,
and desertification.

Ultraviolet (UV) radiation - a portion of the electromagnetic energy
emitted by the sun and naturally filtered in the upper atmosphere by
the ozone layer; UV radiation can be harmful to living organisms and
has been linked to increasing rates of skin cancer in humans.

Waterborne diseases - those in which bacteria survive in, and are
transmitted through, water; always a serious threat in areas with an
untreated water supply.

Environment - international agreements:  This entry separates country
participation in international environmental agreements into two levels
- party to and signed, but not ratified. Agreements are listed in
alphabetical order by the abbreviated form of the full name.

Environmental agreements:  This information is presented in Appendix C:
Selected International Environmental Agreements, which includes the
name, abbreviation, date opened for signature, date entered into force,
objective, and parties by category.

Ethnic groups:  This entry provides an ordered listing of ethnic groups
starting with the largest and normally includes the percent of total
population.

Exchange rates:  This entry provides the official value of a country's
monetary unit at a given date or over a given period of time, as
expressed in units of local currency per US dollar and as determined by
international market forces or official fiat. The International
Organization for Standardization (ISO) 4217 alphabetic currency code
for the national medium of exchange is presented in parenthesis.

Executive branch:  This entry includes several subfields. Chief of
state includes the name and title of the titular leader of the country
who represents the state at official and ceremonial functions but may
not be involved with the day-to-day activities of the government. Head
of government includes the name and title of the top administrative
leader who is designated to manage the day-to-day activities of the
government. For example, in the UK, the monarch is the chief of state,
and the prime minister is the head of government. In the US, the
president is both the chief of state and the head of government.
Cabinet includes the official name for this body of high-ranking
advisers and the method for selection of members. Elections include the
nature of election process or accession to power, date of the last
election, and date of the next election. Election results includes the
percent of vote for each candidate in the last election.

Exports:  This entry provides the total US dollar amount of merchandise
exports on an f.o.b. (free on board) basis. These figures are
calculated on an exchange rate basis, i.e., not in purchasing power
parity (PPP) terms.

Exports - commodities:  This entry provides a listing of the highest-
valued exported products; it sometimes includes the percent of total
dollar value.

Exports - partners:  This entry provides a rank ordering of trading
partners starting with the most important; it sometimes includes the
percent of total dollar value.

Flag description:  This entry provides a written flag description
produced from actual flags or the best information available at the
time the entry was written. The flags of independent states are used by
their dependencies unless there is an officially recognized local flag.
Some disputed and other areas do not have flags.

Flag graphic:  Most versions of the Factbook include a color flag at
the beginning of the country profile. The flag graphics were produced
from actual flags or the best information available at the time of
preparation. The flags of independent states are used by their
dependencies unless there is an officially recognized local flag. Some
disputed and other areas do not have flags.

Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural):  This entry
provides the annual quantity of water in cubic kilometers removed from
available sources for use in any purpose. Water drawn-off is not
necessarily entirely consumed and some portion may be returned for
further use downstream. Domestic sector use refers to water supplied by
public distribution systems. Note that some of this total may be used
for small industrial and/or limited agricultural purposes. Industrial
sector use is the quantity of water used by self-supplied industries
not connected to a public distribution system. Agricultural sector use
includes water used for irrigation and livestock watering, and does not
account for agriculture directly dependent on rainfall. Included are
figures for total annual water withdrawal and per capita water
withdrawal.

GDP (official exchange rate):  This entry gives the gross domestic
product (GDP) or value of all final goods and services produced within
a nation in a given year. A nation's GDP at official exchange rates
(OER) is the home-currency-denominated annual GDP figure divided by the
bilateral average US exchange rate with that country in that year. The
measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value
of output. Many economists prefer this measure when gauging the
economic power an economy maintains vis-à-vis its neighbors, judging
that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in
the international marketplace. Official exchange rates, however, can be
artificially fixed and/or subject to manipulation - resulting in claims
of the country having an under- or over-valued currency - and are not
necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate.
Moreover, even if the official exchange rate is market-determined,
market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small
set of goods and services (the ones the country trades) and may not
capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces.
Furthermore, OER-converted GDP is not well suited to comparing domestic
GDP over time, since appreciation/depreciation from one year to the
next will make the OER GDP value rise/fall regardless of whether home-
currency-denominated GDP changed.

GDP (purchasing power parity):  This entry gives the gross domestic
product (GDP) or value of all final goods and services produced within
a nation in a given year. A nation's GDP at purchasing power parity
(PPP) exchange rates is the sum value of all goods and services
produced in the country valued at prices prevailing in the United
States. This is the measure most economists prefer when looking at per-
capita welfare and when comparing living conditions or use of resources
across countries. The measure is difficult to compute, as a US dollar
value has to be assigned to all goods and services in the country
regardless of whether these goods and services have a direct equivalent
in the United States (for example, the value of an ox-cart or non-US
military equipment); as a result, PPP estimates for some countries are
based on a small and sometimes different set of goods and services. In
addition, many countries do not formally participate in the World
Bank's PPP project that calculates these measures, so the resulting GDP
estimates for these countries may lack precision. For many developing
countries, PPP-based GDP measures are multiples of the official
exchange rate (OER) measure. The difference between the OER- and PPP-
denominated GDP values for most of the wealthy industrialized countries
are generally much smaller.

GDP - composition by sector:  This entry gives the percentage
contribution of agriculture, industry, and services to total GDP. The
distribution will total less than 100 percent if the data are
incomplete.

GDP - per capita (PPP):  This entry shows GDP on a purchasing power
parity basis divided by population as of 1 July for the same year.

GDP - real growth rate:  This entry gives GDP growth on an annual basis
adjusted for inflation and expressed as a percent.

GDP methodology:  In the Economy category, GDP dollar estimates for
countries are reported both on an official exchange rate (OER) and a
purchasing power parity (PPP) basis. Both measures contain information
that is useful to the reader. The PPP method involves the use of
standardized international dollar price weights, which are applied to
the quantities of final goods and services produced in a given economy.
The data derived from the PPP method probably provide the best
available starting point for comparisons of economic strength and well-
being between countries. In contrast, the currency exchange rate method
involves a variety of international and domestic financial forces that
may not capture the value of domestic output. Whereas PPP estimates for
OECD countries are quite reliable, PPP estimates for developing
countries are often rough approximations. In developing countries with
weak currencies, the exchange rate estimate of GDP in dollars is
typically one-fourth to one-half the PPP estimate. Most of the GDP
estimates for developing countries are based on extrapolation of PPP
numbers published by the UN International Comparison Program (UNICP)
and by Professors Robert Summers and Alan Heston of the University of
Pennsylvania and their colleagues. GDP derived using the OER method
should be used for the purpose of calculating the share of items such
as exports, imports, military expenditures, external debt, or the
current account balance, because the dollar values presented in the
Factbook for these items have been converted at official exchange
rates, not at PPP. One should use the OER GDP figure to calculate the
proportion of, say, Chinese defense expenditures in GDP, because that
share will be the same as one calculated in local currency units.
Comparison of OER GDP with PPP GDP may also indicate whether a currency
is over- or under-valued. If OER GDP is smaller than PPP GDP, the
official exchange rate may be undervalued, and vice versa. However,
there is no strong historical evidence that market exchange rates move
in the direction implied by the PPP rate, at least not in the short- or
medium-term. Note: the numbers for GDP and other economic data should
not be chained together from successive volumes of the Factbook because
of changes in the US dollar measuring rod, revisions of data by
statistical agencies, use of new or different sources of information,
and changes in national statistical methods and practices.

GNP:  Gross national product (GNP) is the value of all final goods and
services produced within a nation in a given year, plus income earned
by its citizens abroad, minus income earned by foreigners from domestic
production. The Factbook, following current practice, uses GDP rather
than GNP to measure national production. However, the user must realize
that in certain countries net remittances from citizens working abroad
may be important to national well-being.

GWP:  This entry gives the gross world product (GWP) or aggregate value
of all final goods and services produced worldwide in a given year.

Geographic coordinates:  This entry includes rounded latitude and
longitude figures for the purpose of finding the approximate geographic
center of an entity and is based on the locations provided in the
Geographic Names Server (GNS), maintained by the National Geospatial-
Intelligence Agency on behalf of the US Board on Geographic Names.

Geographic names:  This information is presented in Appendix F: Cross-
Reference List of Geographic Names. It includes a listing of various
alternate names, former names, local names, and regional names
referenced to one or more related Factbook entries. Spellings are
normally, but not always, those approved by the US Board on Geographic
Names (BGN). Alternate names and additional information are included in
parentheses.

Geography:  This category includes the entries dealing with the natural
environment and the effects of human activity.

Geography - note:  This entry includes miscellaneous geographic
information of significance not included elsewhere.

Gini index:  See entry for Distribution of family income - Gini index

Government:  This category includes the entries dealing with the system
for the adoption and administration of public policy.

Government - note:  This entry includes miscellaneous government
information of significance not included elsewhere.

Government type:  This entry gives the basic form of government.
Definitions of the major governmental terms are as follows. (Note that
for some countries more than one definition applies.):

Absolute monarchy - a form of government where the monarch rules
unhindered, i.e., without any laws, constitution, or legally organized
opposition.

Anarchy - a condition of lawlessness or political disorder brought
about by the absence of governmental authority.

Authoritarian - a form of government in which state authority is
imposed onto many aspects of citizens' lives.

Commonwealth - a nation, state, or other political entity founded on
law and united by a compact of the people for the common good.

Communist - a system of government in which the state plans and
controls the economy and a single - often authoritarian - party holds
power; state controls are imposed with the elimination of private
ownership of property or capital while claiming to make progress toward
a higher social order in which all goods are equally shared by the
people (i.e., a classless society).

Confederacy (Confederation) - a union by compact or treaty between
states, provinces, or territories, that creates a central government
with limited powers; the constituent entities retain supreme authority
over all matters except those delegated to the central government.

Constitutional - a government by or operating under an authoritative
document (constitution) that sets forth the system of fundamental laws
and principles that determines the nature, functions, and limits of
that government.

Constitutional democracy - a form of government in which the sovereign
power of the people is spelled out in a governing constitution.

Constitutional monarchy - a system of government in which a monarch is
guided by a constitution whereby his/her rights, duties, and
responsibilities are spelled out in written law or by custom.

Democracy - a form of government in which the supreme power is retained
by the people, but which is usually exercised indirectly through a
system of representation and delegated authority periodically renewed.

Democratic republic - a state in which the supreme power rests in the
body of citizens entitled to vote for officers and representatives
responsible to them.

Dictatorship - a form of government in which a ruler or small clique
wield absolute power (not restricted by a constitution or laws).

Ecclesiastical - a government administrated by a church.

Emirate - similar to a monarchy or sultanate, but a government in which
the supreme power is in the hands of an emir (the ruler of a Muslim
state); the emir may be an absolute overlord or a sovereign with
constitutionally limited authority.

Federal (Federation) - a form of government in which sovereign power is
formally divided - usually by means of a constitution - between a
central authority and a number of constituent regions (states,
colonies, or provinces) so that each region retains some management of
its internal affairs; differs from a confederacy in that the central
government exerts influence directly upon both individuals as well as
upon the regional units.

Federal republic - a state in which the powers of the central
government are restricted and in which the component parts (states,
colonies, or provinces) retain a degree of self-government; ultimate
sovereign power rests with the voters who chose their governmental
representatives.

Islamic republic - a particular form of government adopted by some
Muslim states; although such a state is, in theory, a theocracy, it
remains a republic, but its laws are required to be compatible with the
laws of Islam.

Maoism - the theory and practice of Marxism-Leninism developed in China
by Mao Zedong (Mao Tse-tung), which states that a continuous revolution
is necessary if the leaders of a communist state are to keep in touch
with the people.

Marxism - the political, economic, and social principles espoused by
19th century economist Karl Marx; he viewed the struggle of workers as
a progression of historical forces that would proceed from a class
struggle of the proletariat (workers) exploited by capitalists
(business owners), to a socialist "dictatorship of the proletariat,"
to, finally, a classless society - Communism.

Marxism-Leninism - an expanded form of communism developed by Lenin
from doctrines of Karl Marx; Lenin saw imperialism as the final stage
of capitalism and shifted the focus of workers' struggle from developed
to underdeveloped countries.

Monarchy - a government in which the supreme power is lodged in the
hands of a monarch who reigns over a state or territory, usually for
life and by hereditary right; the monarch may be either a sole absolute
ruler or a sovereign - such as a king, queen, or prince - with
constitutionally limited authority.

Oligarchy - a government in which control is exercised by a small group
of individuals whose authority generally is based on wealth or power.

Parliamentary democracy - a political system in which the legislature
(parliament) selects the government - a prime minister, premier, or
chancellor along with the cabinet ministers - according to party
strength as expressed in elections; by this system, the government
acquires a dual responsibility: to the people as well as to the
parliament.

Parliamentary government (Cabinet-Parliamentary government) - a
government in which members of an executive branch (the cabinet and its
leader - a prime minister, premier, or chancellor) are nominated to
their positions by a legislature or parliament, and are directly
responsible to it; this type of government can be dissolved at will by
the parliament (legislature) by means of a no confidence vote or the
leader of the cabinet may dissolve the parliament if it can no longer
function.

Parliamentary monarchy - a state headed by a monarch who is not
actively involved in policy formation or implementation (i.e., the
exercise of sovereign powers by a monarch in a ceremonial capacity);
true governmental leadership is carried out by a cabinet and its head -
a prime minister, premier, or chancellor - who are drawn from a
legislature (parliament).

Presidential - a system of government where the executive branch exists
separately from a legislature (to which it is generally not
accountable).

Republic - a representative democracy in which the people's elected
deputies (representatives), not the people themselves, vote on
legislation.

Socialism - a government in which the means of planning, producing, and
distributing goods is controlled by a central government that
theoretically seeks a more just and equitable distribution of property
and labor; in actuality, most socialist governments have ended up being
no more than dictatorships over workers by a ruling elite.

Sultanate - similar to a monarchy, but a government in which the
supreme power is in the hands of a sultan (the head of a Muslim state);
the sultan may be an absolute ruler or a sovereign with
constitutionally limited authority.

Theocracy - a form of government in which a Deity is recognized as the
supreme civil ruler, but the Deity's laws are interpreted by
ecclesiastical authorities (bishops, mullahs, etc.); a government
subject to religious authority.

Totalitarian - a government that seeks to subordinate the individual to
the state by controlling not only all political and economic matters,
but also the attitudes, values, and beliefs of its population.

Greenwich Mean Time (GMT):  The mean solar time at the Greenwich
Meridian, Greenwich, England, with the hours and days, since 1925,
reckoned from midnight. GMT is now a historical term having been
replaced by UTC on 1 January 1972. See Coordinated Universal Time.

HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate:  This entry gives an estimate of the
percentage of adults (aged 15-49) living with HIV/AIDS. The adult
prevalence rate is calculated by dividing the estimated number of
adults living with HIV/AIDS at yearend by the total adult population at
yearend.

HIV/AIDS - deaths:  This entry gives an estimate of the number of
adults and children who died of AIDS during a given calendar year.

HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS:  This entry gives an estimate
of all people (adults and children) alive at yearend with HIV
infection, whether or not they have developed symptoms of AIDS.

Heliports:  This entry gives the total number of heliports with hard-
surface runways, helipads, or landing areas that support routine
sustained helicopter operations exclusively and have support facilities
including one or more of the following facilities: lighting, fuel,
passenger handling, or maintenance. It includes former airports used
exclusively for helicopter operations but excludes heliports limited to
day operations and natural clearings that could support helicopter
landings and takeoffs.

Household income or consumption by percentage share:  Data on household
income or consumption come from household surveys, the results adjusted
for household size. Nations use different standards and procedures in
collecting and adjusting the data. Surveys based on income will
normally show a more unequal distribution than surveys based on
consumption. The quality of surveys is improving with time, yet caution
is still necessary in making inter-country comparisons.

Hydrographic data codes:  see Data codes

Illicit drugs:  This entry gives information on the five categories of
illicit drugs - narcotics, stimulants, depressants (sedatives),
hallucinogens, and cannabis. These categories include many drugs
legally produced and prescribed by doctors as well as those illegally
produced and sold outside of medical channels.

Cannabis (Cannabis sativa) is the common hemp plant, which provides
hallucinogens with some sedative properties, and includes marijuana
(pot, Acapulco gold, grass, reefer), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC,
Marinol), hashish (hash), and hashish oil (hash oil).

Coca (mostly Erythroxylum coca) is a bush with leaves that contain the
stimulant used to make cocaine. Coca is not to be confused with cocoa,
which comes from cacao seeds and is used in making chocolate, cocoa,
and cocoa butter.

Cocaine is a stimulant derived from the leaves of the coca bush.

Depressants (sedatives) are drugs that reduce tension and anxiety and
include chloral hydrate, barbiturates (Amytal, Nembutal, Seconal,
phenobarbital), benzodiazepines (Librium, Valium), methaqualone
(Quaalude), glutethimide (Doriden), and others (Equanil, Placidyl,
Valmid).

Drugs are any chemical substances that effect a physical, mental,
emotional, or behavioral change in an individual.

Drug abuse is the use of any licit or illicit chemical substance that
results in physical, mental, emotional, or behavioral impairment in an
individual.

Hallucinogens are drugs that affect sensation, thinking, self-
awareness, and emotion. Hallucinogens include LSD (acid, microdot),
mescaline and peyote (mexc, buttons, cactus), amphetamine variants
(PMA, STP, DOB), phencyclidine (PCP, angel dust, hog), phencyclidine
analogues (PCE, PCPy, TCP), and others (psilocybin, psilocyn).

Hashish is the resinous exudate of the cannabis or hemp plant (Cannabis
sativa).

Heroin is a semisynthetic derivative of morphine.

Mandrax is a trade name for methaqualone, a pharmaceutical depressant.

Marijuana is the dried leaf of the cannabis or hemp plant (Cannabis
sativa).

Methaqualone is a pharmaceutical depressant, referred to as mandrax in
Southwest Asia and Africa.

Narcotics are drugs that relieve pain, often induce sleep, and refer to
opium, opium derivatives, and synthetic substitutes. Natural narcotics
include opium (paregoric, parepectolin), morphine (MS-Contin, Roxanol),
codeine (Tylenol with codeine, Empirin with codeine, Robitussin AC),
and thebaine. Semisynthetic narcotics include heroin (horse, smack),

Pethidine (Demerol, Mepergan), methadone (Dolophine, Methadose), and
others (Darvon, Lomotil).

Opium is the brown, gummy exudate of the incised, unripe seedpod of the
opium poppy.

Opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) is the source for the natural and
semisynthetic narcotics.

Poppy straw is the entire cut and dried opium poppy-plant material,
other than the seeds. Opium is extracted from poppy straw in commercial
operations that produce the drug for medical use.

activity, and include cocaine (coke, snow, crack), amphetamines
(Desoxyn, Dexedrine), ephedrine, ecstasy (clarity, essence, doctor,
Adam), phenmetrazine (Preludin), methylphenidate (Ritalin), and others
(Cylert, Sanorex, Tenuate).

Imports:  This entry provides the total US dollar amount of merchandise
imports on a c.i.f. (cost, insurance, and freight) or f.o.b. (free on
board) basis. These figures are calculated on an exchange rate basis,
i.e., not in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.

Imports - commodities:  This entry provides a listing of the highest-
valued imported products; it sometimes includes the percent of total
dollar value.

Imports - partners:  This entry provides a rank ordering of trading
partners starting with the most important; it sometimes includes the
percent of total dollar value.

Independence:  For most countries, this entry gives the date that
sovereignty was achieved and from which nation, empire, or trusteeship.
For the other countries, the date given may not represent
"independence" in the strict sense, but rather some significant
nationhood event such as the traditional founding date or the date of
unification, federation, confederation, establishment, fundamental
change in the form of government, or state succession. Dependent areas
include the notation "none" followed by the nature of their dependency
status. Also see the Terminology note.

Industrial production growth rate:  This entry gives the annual
percentage increase in industrial production (includes manufacturing,
mining, and construction).

Industries:  This entry provides a rank ordering of industries starting
with the largest by value of annual output.

Infant mortality rate:  This entry gives the number of deaths of
infants under one year old in a given year per 1,000 live births in the
same year; included is the total death rate, and deaths by sex, male
and female. This rate is often used as an indicator of the level of
health in a country.

Inflation rate (consumer prices):  This entry furnishes the annual
percent change in consumer prices compared with the previous year's
consumer prices.

International disputes:  see Disputes - international

International organization participation:  This entry lists in
alphabetical order by abbreviation those international organizations in
which the subject country is a member or participates in some other
way.

International organizations:  This information is presented in Appendix
B: International Organizations and Groups which includes the name,
abbreviation, date established, aim, and members by category.

Internet country code:  This entry includes the two-letter codes
maintained by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
in the ISO 3166 Alpha-2 list and used by the Internet Assigned Numbers
Authority (IANA) to establish country-coded top-level domains (ccTLDs).

Internet hosts:  This entry lists the number of Internet hosts
available within a country. An Internet host is a computer connected
directly to the Internet; normally an Internet Service Provider's (ISP)
computer is a host. Internet users may use either a hard-wired
terminal, at an institution with a mainframe computer connected
directly to the Internet, or may connect remotely by way of a modem via
telephone line, cable, or satellite to the Internet Service Provider's
host computer. The number of hosts is one indicator of the extent of
Internet connectivity.

Internet users:  This entry gives the number of users within a country
that access the Internet. Statistics vary from country to country and
may include users who access the Internet at least several times a week
to those who access it only once within a period of several months.

Introduction:  This category includes one entry, Background.

Investment (gross fixed):  This entry records total business spending
on fixed assets, such as factories, machinery, equipment, dwellings,
and inventories of raw materials, which provide the basis for future
production. It is measured gross of the depreciation of the assets,
i.e., it includes investment that merely replaces worn-out or scrapped
capital.

Irrigated land:  This entry gives the number of square kilometers of
land area that is artificially supplied with water.

Judicial branch:  This entry contains the name(s) of the highest
court(s) and a brief description of the selection process for members.

Labor force:  This entry contains the total labor force figure.

Labor force - by occupation:  This entry lists the percentage
distribution of the labor force by occupation. The distribution will
total less than 100 percent if the data are incomplete.

Land boundaries:  This entry contains the total length of all land
boundaries and the individual lengths for each of the contiguous border
countries. When available, official lengths published by national
statistical agencies are used. Because surveying methods may differ,
country border lengths reported by contiguous countries may differ.

Land use:  This entry contains the percentage shares of total land area
for three different types of land use: arable land - land cultivated
for crops like wheat, maize, and rice that are replanted after each
harvest; permanent crops - land cultivated for crops like citrus,
coffee, and rubber that are not replanted after each harvest; includes
land under flowering shrubs, fruit trees, nut trees, and vines, but
excludes land under trees grown for wood or timber; other - any land
not arable or under permanent crops; includes permanent meadows and
pastures, forests and woodlands, built-on areas, roads, barren land,
etc.

Languages:  This entry provides a rank ordering of languages starting
with the largest and sometimes includes the percent of total population
speaking that language.

Legal system:  This entry contains a brief description of the legal
system's historical roots, role in government, and acceptance of
International Court of Justice (ICJ) jurisdiction.

Legislative branch:  This entry contains information on the structure
(unicameral, bicameral, tricameral), formal name, number of seats, and
term of office. Elections includes the nature of election process or
accession to power, date of the last election, and date of the next
election. Election results includes the percent of vote and/or number
of seats held by each party in the last election.

Life expectancy at birth:  This entry contains the average number of
years to be lived by a group of people born in the same year, if
mortality at each age remains constant in the future. The entry
includes total population as well as the male and female components.
Life expectancy at birth is also a measure of overall quality of life
in a country and summarizes the mortality at all ages. It can also be
thought of as indicating the potential return on investment in human
capital and is necessary for the calculation of various actuarial
measures.

Literacy:  This entry includes a definition of literacy and Census
Bureau percentages for the total population, males, and females. There
are no universal definitions and standards of literacy. Unless
otherwise specified, all rates are based on the most common definition
- the ability to read and write at a specified age. Detailing the
standards that individual countries use to assess the ability to read
and write is beyond the scope of the Factbook. Information on literacy,
while not a perfect measure of educational results, is probably the
most easily available and valid for international comparisons. Low
levels of literacy, and education in general, can impede the economic
development of a country in the current rapidly changing, technology-
driven world.

Location:  This entry identifies the country's regional location,
neighboring countries, and adjacent bodies of water.

Major infectious diseases:  This entry lists major infectious diseases
likely to be encountered in countries where the risk of such diseases
is assessed to be very high as compared to the United States. These
infectious diseases represent risks to US government personnel
traveling to the specified country for a period of less than three
years. The degree of risk is assessed by considering the foreign nature
of these infectious diseases, their severity, and the probability of
being affected by the diseases present. The diseases listed do not
necessarily represent the total disease burden experienced by the local
population.

The risk to an individual traveler varies considerably by the specific
location, visit duration, type of activities, type of accommodations,
time of year, and other factors. Consultation with a travel medicine
physician is needed to evaluate individual risk and recommend
appropriate preventive measures such as vaccines.

Diseases are organized into the following six exposure categories shown
in italics and listed in typical descending order of risk. Note: The
sequence of exposure categories listed in individual country entries
may vary according to local conditions.

food or waterborne diseases acquired through eating or drinking on the
local economy:

Hepatitis A - viral disease that interferes with the functioning of the
liver; spread through consumption of food or water contaminated with
fecal matter, principally in areas of poor sanitation; victims exhibit
fever, jaundice, and diarrhea; 15% of victims will experience prolonged
symptoms over 6-9 months; vaccine available.

Hepatitis E - water-borne viral disease that interferes with the
functioning of the liver; most commonly spread through fecal
contamination of drinking water; victims exhibit jaundice, fatigue,
abdominal pain, and dark colored urine.

Typhoid fever - bacterial disease spread through contact with food or
water contaminated by fecal matter or sewage; victims exhibit sustained
high fevers; left untreated, mortality rates can reach 20%.

vectorborne diseases acquired through the bite of an infected
arthropod:

Malaria - caused by single-cell parasitic protozoa Plasmodium;
transmitted to humans via the bite of the female Anopheles mosquito;
parasites multiply in the liver attacking red blood cells resulting in
cycles of fever, chills, and sweats accompanied by anemia; death due to
damage to vital organs and interruption of blood supply to the brain;
endemic in 100, mostly tropical, countries with 90% of cases and the
majority of 1.5-2.5 million estimated annual deaths occurring in sub-
Saharan Africa.

Dengue fever - mosquito-borne (Aedes aegypti) viral disease associated
with urban environments; manifests as sudden onset of fever and severe
headache; occasionally produces shock and hemorrhage leading to death
in 5% of cases.

Yellow fever - mosquito-borne viral disease; severity ranges from
influenza-like symptoms to severe hepatitis and hemorrhagic fever;
occurs only in tropical South America and sub-Saharan Africa, where
most cases are reported; fatality rate is less than 20%.

Japanese Encephalitis - mosquito-borne (Culex tritaeniorhynchus) viral
disease associated with rural areas in Asia; acute encephalitis can
progress to paralysis, coma, and death; fatality rates 30%.

African Trypanosomiasis - caused by the parasitic protozoa Trypanosoma;
transmitted to humans via the bite of bloodsucking Tsetse flies;
infection leads to malaise and irregular fevers and, in advanced cases
when the parasites invade the central nervous system, coma and death;
endemic in 36 countries of sub-Saharan Africa; cattle and wild animals
act as reservoir hosts for the parasites.

Cutaneous Leishmaniasis - caused by the parasitic protozoa leishmania;
transmitted to humans via the bite of sandflies; results in skin
lesions that may become chronic; endemic in 88 countries; 90% of cases
occur in Iran, Afghanistan, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, and Peru; wild
and domesticated animals as well as humans can act as reservoirs of
infection.

Plague - bacterial disease transmitted by fleas normally associated
with rats; person-to-person airborne transmission also possible; recent
plague epidemics occurred in areas of Asia, Africa, and South America
associated with rural areas or small towns and villages; manifests as
fever, headache, and painfully swollen lymph nodes; disease progresses
rapidly and without antibiotic treatment leads to pneumonic form with a
death rate in excess of 50%.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever - tick-borne viral disease; infection
may also result from exposure to infected animal blood or tissue;
geographic distribution includes Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and
Eastern Europe; sudden onset of fever, headache, and muscle aches
followed by hemorrhaging in the bowels, urine, nose, and gums;
mortality rate is approximately 30%.

Rift Valley fever - viral disease affecting domesticated animals and
humans; transmission is by mosquito and other biting insects; infection
may also occur through handling of infected meat or contact with blood;
geographic distribution includes eastern and southern Africa where
cattle and sheep are raised; symptoms are generally mild with fever and
some liver abnormalities, but the disease may progress to hemorrhagic
fever, encephalitis, or ocular disease; fatality rates are low at about
1% of cases.

Chikungunya - mosquito-borne (Aedes aegypti) viral disease associated
with urban environments, similar to Dengue Fever; characterized by
sudden onset of fever, rash, and severe joint pain usually lasting 3-7
days, some cases result in persistent arthritis.

water contact diseases acquired through swimming or wading in
freshwater lakes, streams, and rivers:

Leptospirosis - bacterial disease that affects animals and humans;
infection occurs through contact with water, food, or soil contaminated
by animal urine; symptoms include high fever, severe headache,
vomiting, jaundice, and diarrhea; untreated, the disease can result in
kidney damage, liver failure, meningitis, or respiratory distress;
fatality rates are low but left untreated recovery can take months.

Schistosomiasis - caused by parasitic trematode flatworm Schistosoma;
fresh water snails act as intermediate host and release larval form of
parasite that penetrates the skin of people exposed to contaminated
water; worms mature and reproduce in the blood vessels, liver, kidneys,
and intestines releasing eggs, which become trapped in tissues
triggering an immune response; may manifest as either urinary or
intestinal disease resulting in decreased work or learning capacity;
mortality, while generally low, may occur in advanced cases usually due
to bladder cancer; endemic in 74 developing countries with 80% of
infected people living in sub-Saharan Africa; humans act as the
reservoir for this parasite.

aerosolized dust or soil contact disease acquired through inhalation of
aerosols contaminated with rodent urine:

Lassa fever - viral disease carried by rats of the genus Mastomys;
endemic in portions of West Africa; infection occurs through direct
contact with or consumption of food contaminated by rodent urine or
fecal matter containing virus particles; fatality rate can reach 50% in
epidemic outbreaks.

respiratory disease acquired through close contact with an infectious
person:

Meningococcal meningitis - bacterial disease causing an inflammation of
the lining of the brain and spinal cord; one of the most important
bacterial pathogens is Neisseria meningitidis because of its potential
to cause epidemics; symptoms include stiff neck, high fever, headaches,
and vomiting; bacteria are transmitted from person to person by
respiratory droplets and facilitated by close and prolonged contact
resulting from crowded living conditions, often with a seasonal
distribution; death occurs in 5-15% of cases, typically within 24-48
hours of onset of symptoms; highest burden of meningococcal disease
occurs in the hyperendemic region of sub-Saharan Africa known as the
"Meningitis Belt" which stretches from Senegal east to Ethiopia.

animal contact disease acquired through direct contact with local
animals:

Rabies - viral disease of mammals usually transmitted through the bite
of an infected animal, most commonly dogs; virus affects the central
nervous system causing brain alteration and death; symptoms initially
are non-specific fever and headache progressing to neurological
symptoms; death occurs within days of the onset of symptoms.

Manpower available for military service:  This entry gives the number
of males and females falling in the military age range for a country
(defined as being ages 16-49) and assumes that every individual is fit
to serve.

Manpower fit for military service:  This entry gives the number of
males and females falling in the military age range for a country
(defined as being ages 16-49) and who are not otherwise disqualified
for health reasons; accounts for the health situation in the country
and provides a more realistic estimate of the actual number fit to
serve.

Manpower reaching militarily significant age annually:  This entry
gives the number of males and females entering the military manpower
pool (i.e., reaching age 16) in any given year and is a measure of the
availability of military-age young adults.

Map references:  This entry includes the name of the Factbook reference
map on which a country may be found. Note that boundary representations
on these maps are not necessarily authoritative. The entry on
Geographic coordinates may be helpful in finding some smaller
countries.

Maritime claims:  This entry includes the following claims, the
definitions of which are excerpted from the United Nations Convention
on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which alone contains the full and
definitive descriptions:

territorial sea - the sovereignty of a coastal state extends beyond its
land territory and internal waters to an adjacent belt of sea,
described as the territorial sea in the UNCLOS (Part II); this
sovereignty extends to the air space over the territorial sea as well
as its underlying seabed and subsoil; every state has the right to
establish the breadth of its territorial sea up to a limit not
exceeding 12 nautical miles; the normal baseline for measuring the
breadth of the territorial sea is the mean low-water line along the
coast as marked on large-scale charts officially recognized by the
coastal state; the UNCLOS describes specific rules for archipelagic
states.

contiguous zone - according to the UNCLOS (Article 33), this is a zone
contiguous to a coastal state's territorial sea, over which it may
exercise the control necessary to: prevent infringement of its customs,
fiscal, immigration, or sanitary laws and regulations within its
territory or territorial sea; punish infringement of the above laws and
regulations committed within its territory or territorial sea; the
contiguous zone may not extend beyond 24 nautical miles from the
baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured
(e.g. the US has claimed a 12-nautical mile contiguous zone in addition
to its 12-nautical mile territorial sea).

exclusive economic zone (EEZ) - the UNCLOS (Part V) defines the EEZ as
a zone beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea in which a coastal
state has: sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring and
exploiting, conserving and managing the natural resources, whether
living or non-living, of the waters superjacent to the seabed and of
the seabed and its subsoil, and with regard to other activities for the
economic exploitation and exploration of the zone, such as the
production of energy from the water, currents, and winds; jurisdiction
with regard to the establishment and use of artificial islands,
installations, and structures; marine scientific research; the
protection and preservation of the marine environment; the outer limit
of the exclusive economic zone shall not exceed 200 nautical miles from
the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is
measured.

continental shelf - the UNCLOS (Article 76) defines the continental
shelf of a coastal state as comprising the seabed and subsoil of the
submarine areas that extend beyond its territorial sea throughout the
natural prolongation of its land territory to the outer edge of the
continental margin, or to a distance of 200 nautical miles from the
baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured
where the outer edge of the continental margin does not extend up to
that distance; the continental margin comprises the submerged
prolongation of the landmass of the coastal state, and consists of the
seabed and subsoil of the shelf, the slope and the rise; wherever the
continental margin extends beyond 200 nautical miles from the baseline,
coastal states may extend their claim to a distance not to exceed 350
nautical miles from the baseline or 100 nautical miles from the 2500
meter isobath; it does not include the deep ocean floor with its
oceanic ridges or the subsoil thereof.

exclusive fishing zone - while this term is not used in the UNCLOS,
some states (e.g., the United Kingdom) have chosen not to claim an EEZ,
but rather to claim jurisdiction over the living resources off their
coast; in such cases, the term exclusive fishing zone is often used;
the breadth of this zone is normally the same as the EEZ or 200
nautical miles.

Market value of publicly traded shares:  This entry gives the value of
shares issued by publicly traded companies at a price determined in the
national stock markets on the final day of the period indicated. It is
simply the latest price per share multiplied by the total number of
outstanding shares, cumulated over all companies listed on the
particular exchange.

Median age:  This entry is the age that divides a population into two
numerically equal groups; that is, half the people are younger than
this age and half are older. It is a single index that summarizes the
age distribution of a population. Currently, the median age ranges from
a low of about 15 in Uganda and Gaza Strip to 40 or more in several
European countries and Japan. See the entry for "Age structure" for the
importance of a young versus an older age structure and, by
implication, a low versus a higher median age.

Merchant marine:  Merchant marine may be defined as all ships engaged
in the carriage of goods; or all commercial vessels (as opposed to all
nonmilitary ships), which excludes tugs, fishing vessels, offshore oil
rigs, etc. This entry contains information in four fields - total,
ships by type, foreign-owned, and registered in other countries.

Total includes the number of ships (1,000 GRT or over), total DWT for
those ships, and total GRT for those ships. DWT or dead weight tonnage
is the total weight of cargo, plus bunkers, stores, etc., that a ship
can carry when immersed to the appropriate load line. GRT or gross
register tonnage is a figure obtained by measuring the entire sheltered
volume of a ship available for cargo and passengers and converting it
to tons on the basis of 100 cubic feet per ton; there is no stable
relationship between GRT and DWT.

Ships by type includes a listing of barge carriers, bulk cargo ships,
cargo ships, chemical tankers, combination bulk carriers, combination
ore/oil carriers, container ships, liquefied gas tankers, livestock
carriers, multifunctional large-load carriers, petroleum tankers,
passenger ships, passenger/cargo ships, railcar carriers, refrigerated
cargo ships, roll-on/roll-off cargo ships, short-sea passenger ships,
specialized tankers, and vehicle carriers.

Foreign-owned are ships that fly the flag of one country but belong to
owners in another.

Registered in other countries are ships that belong to owners in one
country but fly the flag of another.

Military:  This category includes the entries dealing with a country's
military structure, manpower, and expenditures.

Military - note:  This entry includes miscellaneous military
information of significance not included elsewhere.

Military branches:  This entry lists the service branches subordinate
to defense ministries or the equivalent (typically ground, naval, air,
and marine forces).

Military expenditures:  This entry gives spending on defense programs
for the most recent year available as a percent of gross domestic
product (GDP); the GDP is calculated on an exchange rate basis, i.e.,
not in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP).

Military service age and obligation:  This entry gives the required
ages for voluntary or conscript military service and the length of
service obligation.

Money figures:  All money figures are expressed in contemporaneous US
dollars unless otherwise indicated.

National holiday:  This entry gives the primary national day of
celebration - usually independence day.

Nationality:  This entry provides the identifying terms for citizens -
noun and adjective.

Natural gas - consumption:  This entry is the total natural gas
consumed in cubic meters (cu m). The discrepancy between the amount of
natural gas produced and/or imported and the amount consumed and/or
exported is due to the omission of stock changes and other complicating
factors.

Natural gas - exports:  This entry is the total natural gas exported in
cubic meters (cu m).

Natural gas - imports:  This entry is the total natural gas imported in
cubic meters (cu m).

Natural gas - production:  This entry is the total natural gas produced
in cubic meters (cu m). The discrepancy between the amount of natural
gas produced and/or imported and the amount consumed and/or exported is
due to the omission of stock changes and other complicating factors.

Natural gas - proved reserves:  This entry is the stock of proved
reserves of natural gas in cubic meters (cu m). Proved reserves are
those quantities of natural gas, which, by analysis of geological and
engineering data, can be estimated with a high degree of confidence to
be commercially recoverable from a given date forward, from known
reservoirs and under current economic conditions.

Natural hazards:  This entry lists potential natural disasters.

Natural resources:  This entry lists a country's mineral, petroleum,
hydropower, and other resources of commercial importance.

Net migration rate:  This entry includes the figure for the difference
between the number of persons entering and leaving a country during the
year per 1,000 persons (based on midyear population). An excess of
persons entering the country is referred to as net immigration (e.g.,
3.56 migrants/1,000 population); an excess of persons leaving the
country as net emigration (e.g., -9.26 migrants/1,000 population). The
net migration rate indicates the contribution of migration to the
overall level of population change. High levels of migration can cause
problems such as increasing unemployment and potential ethnic strife
(if people are coming in) or a reduction in the labor force, perhaps in
certain key sectors (if people are leaving).

Oil - consumption:  This entry is the total oil consumed in barrels per
day (bbl/day). The discrepancy between the amount of oil produced
and/or imported and the amount consumed and/or exported is due to the
omission of stock changes, refinery gains, and other complicating
factors.

Oil - exports:  This entry is the total oil exported in barrels per day
(bbl/day), including both crude oil and oil products.

Oil - imports:  This entry is the total oil imported in barrels per day
(bbl/day), including both crude oil and oil products.

Oil - production:  This entry is the total oil produced in barrels per
day (bbl/day). The discrepancy between the amount of oil produced
and/or imported and the amount consumed and/or exported is due to the
omission of stock changes, refinery gains, and other complicating
factors.

Oil - proved reserves:  This entry is the stock of proved reserves of
crude oil in barrels (bbl). Proved reserves are those quantities of
petroleum which, by analysis of geological and engineering data, can be
estimated with a high degree of confidence to be commercially
recoverable from a given date forward, from known reservoirs and under
current economic conditions.

People:  This category includes the entries dealing with the
characteristics of the people and their society.

People - note:  This entry includes miscellaneous demographic
information of significance not included elsewhere.

Personal Names - Capitalization:  The Factbook capitalizes the surname
or family name of individuals for the convenience of our users who are
faced with a world of different cultures and naming conventions. The
need for capitalization, bold type, underlining, italics, or some other
indicator of the individual's surname is apparent in the following
examples: MAO Zedong, Fidel CASTRO Ruz, George W. BUSH, and TUNKU
SALAHUDDIN Abdul Aziz Shah ibni Al-Marhum Sultan Hisammuddin Alam Shah.
By knowing the surname, a short form without all capital letters can be
used with confidence as in President Castro, Chairman Mao, President
Bush, or Sultan Tunku Salahuddin. The same system of capitalization is
extended to the names of leaders with surnames that are not commonly
used such as Queen ELIZABETH II. For Vietnamese names, the given name
is capitalized because officials are referred to by their given name
rather than by their surname. For example, the president of Vietnam is
Tran Duc LUONG. His surname is Tran, but he is referred to by his given
name - President LUONG.

Personal Names - Spelling:  The romanization of personal names in the
Factbook normally follows the same transliteration system used by the
US Board on Geographic Names for spelling place names. At times,
however, a foreign leader expressly indicates a preference for, or the
media or official documents regularly use, a romanized spelling that
differs from the transliteration derived from the US Government
standard. In such cases, the Factbook uses the alternative spelling.

Personal Names - Titles:  The Factbook capitalizes any valid title (or
short form of it) immediately preceding a person's name. A title
standing alone is not capitalized. Examples: President PUTIN and
President BUSH are chiefs of state. In Russia, the president is chief
of state and the premier is the head of the government, while in the
US, the president is both chief of state and head of government.

Petroleum:  See entries under Oil.

Petroleum products:  See entries under Oil.

Pipelines:  This entry gives the lengths and types of pipelines for
transporting products like natural gas, crude oil, or petroleum
products.

Political parties and leaders:  This entry includes a listing of
significant political organizations and their leaders.

Political pressure groups and leaders:  This entry includes a listing
of a country's political, social, labor, or religious organizations
that are involved in politics, or that exert political pressure, but
whose leaders do not stand for legislative election. International
movements or organizations are generally not listed.

Population:  This entry gives an estimate from the US Bureau of the
Census based on statistics from population censuses, vital statistics
registration systems, or sample surveys pertaining to the recent past
and on assumptions about future trends. The total population presents
one overall measure of the potential impact of the country on the world
and within its region. Note: Starting with the 1993 Factbook,
demographic estimates for some countries (mostly African) have
explicitly taken into account the effects of the growing impact of the
HIV/AIDS epidemic. These countries are currently: The Bahamas, Benin,
Botswana, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Burma, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon,
Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of
the Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Guyana, Haiti,
Honduras, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda,
South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, and
Zimbabwe.

Population growth rate:  The average annual percent change in the
population, resulting from a surplus (or deficit) of births over deaths
and the balance of migrants entering and leaving a country. The rate
may be positive or negative. The growth rate is a factor in determining
how great a burden would be imposed on a country by the changing needs
of its people for infrastructure (e.g., schools, hospitals, housing,
roads), resources (e.g., food, water, electricity), and jobs. Rapid
population growth can be seen as threatening by neighboring countries.

Ports and terminals:  This entry lists major ports and terminals
primarily on the basis of the amount of cargo tonnage shipped through
the facilities on an annual basis. In some instances, the number of
containers handled or ship visits were also considered.

Public debt:  This entry records the cumulative total of all government
borrowings less repayments that are denominated in a country's home
currency. Public debt should not be confused with external debt, which
reflects the foreign currency liabilities of both the private and
public sector and must be financed out of foreign exchange earnings.

Radio broadcast stations:  This entry includes the total number of AM,
FM, and shortwave broadcast stations.

Railways:  This entry states the total route length of the railway
network and of its component parts by gauge: broad, standard, narrow,
and dual. Other gauges are listed under note.

Reference maps:  This section includes world and regional maps.

Refugees and internally displaced persons:  This entry includes those
persons residing in a country as refugees or internally displaced
persons (IDPs). The definition of a refugee according to a United
Nations Convention is "a person who is outside his/her country of
nationality or habitual residence; has a well-founded fear of
persecution because of his/her race, religion, nationality, membership
in a particular social group or political opinion; and is unable or
unwilling to avail himself/herself of the protection of that country,
or to return there, for fear of persecution." The UN established the
Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in 1950 to
handle refugee matters worldwide. The UN Relief and Works Agency for
Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) has a different operational
definition for a Palestinian refugee: "a person whose normal place of
residence was Palestine during the period 1 June 1946 to 15 May 1948
and who lost both home and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948
conflict." However, UNHCR also assists some 400,000 Palestinian
refugees not covered under the UNRWA definition. The term "internally
displaced person" is not specifically covered in the UN Convention; it
is used to describe people who have fled their homes for reasons
similar to refugees, but who remain within their own national territory
and are subject to the laws of that state.

Religions:  This entry is an ordered listing of religions by adherents
starting with the largest group and sometimes includes the percent of
total population. The core characteristics and beliefs of the world's
major religions are described below.

Baha'i - Founded by Mirza Husayn-Ali (known as Baha'u'llah) in Iran in
1852, Baha'i faith emphasizes monotheism and believes in one eternal
transcendent God. Its guiding focus is to encourage the unity of all
peoples on the earth so that justice and peace may be achieved on
earth. Baha'i revelation contends the prophets of major world religions
reflect some truth or element of the divine, believes all were
manifestations of God given to specific communities in specific times,
and that Baha'u'llah is an additional prophet meant to call all
humankind. Bahais are an open community, located worldwide, with the
greatest concentration of believers in South Asia.

Buddhism - Religion or philosophy inspired by the 5th century B.C.
teachings of Siddhartha Gautama (also known as Gautama Buddha "the
enlightened one"). Buddhism focuses on the goal of spiritual
enlightenment centered on an understanding of Gautama Buddha's Four
Noble Truths on the nature of suffering, and on the Eightfold Path of
spiritual and moral practice, to break the cycle of suffering of which
we are a part. Buddhism ascribes to a karmic system of rebirth. Several
schools and sects of Buddhism exist, differing often on the nature of
the Buddha, the extent to which enlightenment can be achieved - for one
or for all, and by whom - religious orders or laity.

Basic Groupings

   Theravada Buddhism: The oldest Buddhist school, Theravada is
practiced mostly in Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Laos, Burma, and Thailand,
with minority representation elsewhere in Asia and the West.
Theravadans follow the Pali Canon of Buddha's teachings, and believe
that one may escape the cycle of rebirth, worldly attachment, and
suffering for oneself; this process may take one or several lifetimes.

   Mahayana Buddhism, including subsets Zen and Tibetan Buddhism: Forms
of Mahayana Buddhism are common in East Asia and Tibet, and parts of
the West. Mahayanas have additional scriptures beyond the Pali Canon
and believe the Buddha is eternal and still teaching. Unlike Theravada
Buddhism, Mahayana schools maintain the Buddha-nature is present in all
beings and all will ultimately achieve enlightenment.

Christianity - Descending from Judaism, Christianity's central belief
maintains Jesus of Nazareth is the promised messiah of the Hebrew
Scriptures, and that his life, death, and resurrection are salvific for
the world. Christianity is one of the three monotheistic Abrahamic
faiths, along with Islam and Judaism, which traces its spiritual
lineage to Abraham of the Hebrew Scriptures. Its sacred texts include
the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament (or the Christian Gospels).

Basic Groupings

   Catholicism (or Roman Catholicism): This is the oldest established
western Christian church and the world's largest single religious body.
It is supranational, and recognizes a hierarchical structure with the
Pope, or Bishop of Rome, as its head, located at the Vatican. Catholics
believe the Pope is the divinely ordered head of the Church from a
direct spiritual legacy of Jesus' apostle Peter. Catholicism is
comprised of 23 particular Churches, or Rites - one Western (Latin-
Rite) and 22 Eastern. The Latin Rite is by far the largest, making up
about 98% of Catholic membership. Eastern-Rite Churches, such as the
Maronite Church and the Ukrainian Catholic Church, are in communion
with Rome although they preserve their own worship traditions and their
immediate hierarchy consists of clergy within their own rite. The
Catholic Church has a comprehensive theological and moral doctrine
specified for believers in its catechism, which makes it unique among
most forms of Christianity.

   Mormonism (including the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day
Saints): Originating in 1830 in the United States under Joseph Smith,
Mormonism is not characterized as a form of Protestant Christianity
because it claims additional revealed Christian scriptures after the
Hebrew Bible and New Testament. The Book of Mormon maintains there was
an appearance of Jesus in the New World following the Christian account
of his resurrection, and that the Americas are uniquely blessed
continents. Mormonism believes earlier Christian traditions, such as
the Roman Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant reform faiths, are
apostasies and that Joseph Smith's revelation of the Book of Mormon is
a restoration of true Christianity. Mormons have a hierarchical
religious leadership structure, and actively proselytize their faith;
they are located primarily in the Americas and in a number of other
Western countries.

   Orthodox Christianity: The oldest established eastern form of
Christianity, the Holy Orthodox Church, has a ceremonial head in the
Bishop of Constantinople (Istanbul), also known as a Patriarch, but its
various regional forms (e.g., Greek Orthodox, Russian Orthodox, Serbian
Orthodox, Ukrainian Orthodox) are autocephalous (independent of
Constantinople's authority, and have their own Patriarchs). Orthodox
churches are highly nationalist and ethnic. The Orthodox Christian
faith shares many theological tenets with the Roman Catholic Church,
but diverges on some key premises and does not recognize the governing
authority of the Pope.

   Protestant Christianity: Protestant Christianity originated in the
16th century as an attempt to reform Roman Catholicism's practices,
dogma, and theology. It encompasses several forms or denominations
which are extremely varied in structure, beliefs, relationship to
state, clergy, and governance. Many protestant theologies emphasize the
primary role of scripture in their faith, advocating individual
interpretation of Christian texts without the mediation of a final
religious authority such as the Roman Pope. The oldest Protestant
Christianities include Lutheranism, Calvinism (Presbyterians), and
Anglican Christianity (Episcopalians), which have established
liturgies, governing structure, and formal clergy. Other variants on
Protestant Christianity, including Pentecostal movements and
independent churches, may lack one or more of these elements, and their
leadership and beliefs are individualized and dynamic.

Hinduism - Originating in the Vedic civilization of India (second and
first millennium B.C.), Hinduism is an extremely diverse set of beliefs
and practices with no single founder or religious authority. Hinduism
has many scriptures; the Vedas, the Upanishads, and the Bhagavad-Gita
are among some of the most important. Hindus may worship one or many
deities, usually with prayer rituals within their own home. The most
common figures of devotion are the gods Vishnu, Shiva, and a mother
goddess, Devi. Most Hindus believe the soul, or atman, is eternal, and
goes through a cycle of birth, death, and rebirth (samsara) determined
by one's positive or negative karma, or the consequences of one's
actions. The goal of religious life is to learn to act so as to finally
achieve liberation (moksha) of one's soul, escaping the rebirth cycle.

Islam - The third of the monotheistic Abrahamic faiths, Islam
originated with the teachings of Muhammad in the 7th century. Muslims
believe Muhammad is the final of all religious prophets (beginning with
Abraham) and that the Qu'ran, which is the Islamic scripture, was
revealed to him by God. Islam derives from the word submission, and
obedience to God is a primary theme in this religion. In order to live
an Islamic life, believers must follow the five pillars, or tenets, of
Islam, which are the testimony of faith (shahada), daily prayer
(salah), giving alms (zakah), fasting during Ramadan (sawm), and the
pilgrimage to Mecca (hajj).

Basic Groupings

   The two primary branches of Islam are Sunni and Shia, which split
from each other over a religio-political leadership dispute about the
rightful successor to Muhammad. The Shia believe Muhammad's cousin and
son-in-law, Ali, was the only divinely ordained Imam (religious
leader), while the Sunni maintain the first three caliphs after
Muhammad were also legitimate authorities. In modern Islam, Sunnis and
Shia continue to have different views of acceptable schools of Islamic
jurisprudence, and who is a proper Islamic religious authority. Islam
also has an active mystical branch, Sufism, with various Sunni and Shia
subsets.

    Sunni Islam accounts for over 75% of the world's Muslim population.
It recognizes the Abu Bakr as the first caliph after Muhammad. Sunni
has four schools of Islamic doctrine and law - Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i,
and Hanbali - which uniquely interpret the Hadith, or recorded oral
traditions of Muhammad. A Sunni Muslim may elect to follow any one of
these schools, as all are considered equally valid.

    Shia Islam represents 10-20% of Muslims worldwide, and its
distinguishing feature is its reverence for Ali as an infallible,
divinely inspired leader, and as the first Imam of the Muslim community
after Muhammad. A majority of Shia are known as "Twelvers," because
they believe that the 11 familial successor imams after Muhammad
culminate in a 12th Imam (al-Mahdi) who is hidden in the world and will
reappear at its end to redeem the righteous.

Variants

   Ismaili faith: A sect of Shia Islam, its adherents are also known as
"Seveners," because they believe that the rightful seventh Imam in
Islamic leadership was Isma'il, the elder son of Imam Jafar al-Sadiq.
Ismaili tradition awaits the return of the seventh Imam as the Mahdi,
or Islamic messianic figure. Ismailis are located in various parts of
the world, particularly South Asia and the Levant.

   Alawi faith: Another Shia sect of Islam, the name reflects
followers' devotion to the religious authority of Ali. Alawites are a
closed, secretive religious group who assert they are Shia Muslims,
although outside scholars speculate their beliefs may have a syncretic
mix with other faiths originating in the Middle East. Alawis live
mostly in Syria, Lebanon, and Turkey.

   Druze faith: A highly secretive tradition and a closed community
that derives from the Ismaili sect of Islam; its core beliefs are
thought to emphasize a combination of Gnostic principles believing that
the Fatimid caliph, al-Hakin, is the one who embodies the key aspects
of goodness of the universe, which are, the intellect, the word, the
soul, the preceder, and the follower. The Druze have a key presence in
Syria, Lebanon, and Israel.

Jainism - Originating in India, Jain spiritual philosophy believes in
an eternal human soul, the eternal universe, and a principle of "the
own nature of things." It emphasizes compassion for all living things,
seeks liberation of the human soul from reincarnation through
enlightenment, and values personal responsibility due to the belief in
the immediate consequences of one's behavior. Jain philosophy teaches
non-violence and prescribes vegetarianism for monks and laity alike;
its adherents are a highly influential religious minority in Indian
society.

Judaism - One of the first known monotheistic religions, likely dating
to between 2000-1500 B.C., Judaism is the native faith of the Jewish
people, based upon the belief in a covenant of responsibility between a
sole omnipotent creator God and Abraham, the patriarch of Judaism's
Hebrew Bible, or Tanakh. Divine revelation of principles and
prohibitions in the Hebrew Scriptures form the basis of Jewish law, or
halakhah, which is a key component of the faith. While there are
extensive traditions of Jewish halakhic and theological discourse,
there is no final dogmatic authority in the tradition. Local
communities have their own religious leadership. Modern Judaism has
three basic categories of faith: Orthodox, Conservative, and
Reform/Liberal. These differ in their views and observance of Jewish
law, with the Orthodox representing the most traditional practice, and
Reform/Liberal communities the most accommodating of individualized
interpretations of Jewish identity and faith.

Shintoism - A native animist tradition of Japan, Shinto practice is
based upon the premise that every being and object has its own spirit
or kami. Shinto practitioners worship several particular kamis,
including the kamis of nature, and families often have shrines to their
ancestors' kamis. Shintoism has no fixed tradition of prayers or
prescribed dogma, but is characterized by individual ritual. Respect
for the kamis in nature is a key Shinto value. Prior to the end of
World War II, Shinto was the state religion of Japan, and bolstered the
cult of the Japanese emperor.

Sikhism - Founded by the Guru Nanak (born 1469), Sikhism believes in a
non-anthropomorphic, supreme, eternal, creator God; centering one's
devotion to God is seen as a means of escaping the cycle of rebirth.
Sikhs follow the teachings of Nanak and nine subsequent gurus. Their
scripture, the Guru Granth Sahib - also known as the Adi Granth - is
considered the living Guru, or final authority of Sikh faith and
theology. Sikhism emphasizes equality of humankind and disavows caste,
class, or gender discrimination.

Taoism - Chinese philosophy or religion based upon Lao Tzu's Tao Te
Ching, which centers on belief in the Tao, or the way, as the flow of
the universe and the nature of things. Taoism encourages a principle of
non-force, or wu-wei, as the means to live harmoniously with the Tao.
Taoists believe the esoteric world is made up of a perfect harmonious
balance and nature, while in the manifest world - particularly in the
body - balance is distorted. The Three Jewels of the Tao - compassion,
simplicity, and humility - serve as the basis for Taoist ethics.

Zoroastrianism - Originating from the teachings of Zoroaster in about
the 9th or 10th century B.C., Zoroastrianism may be the oldest
continuing creedal religion. Its key beliefs center on a transcendent
creator God, Ahura Mazda, and the concept of free will. The key ethical
tenets of Zoroastrianism expressed in its scripture, the Avesta, are
based on a dualistic worldview where one may prevent chaos if one
chooses to serve God and exercises good thoughts, good words, and good
deeds. Zoroastrianism is generally a closed religion and members are
almost always born to Zoroastrian parents. Prior to the spread of
Islam, Zoroastrianism dominated greater Iran. Today, though a minority,
Zoroastrians remain primarily in Iran, India, and Pakistan.

Reserves of foreign exchange and gold:  This entry gives the dollar
value for the stock of all financial assets that are available to the
central monetary authority for use in meeting a country's balance of
payments needs as of the end-date of the period specified. This
category includes not only foreign currency and gold, but also a
country's holdings of Special Drawing Rights in the International
Monetary Fund, and its reserve position in the Fund.

Roadways:  This entry gives the total length of the road network and
includes the length of the paved and unpaved portions.

School life expectancy (primary to tertiary):  School life expectancy
(SLE) is the total number of years of schooling (primary to tertiary)
that a child can expect to receive, assuming that the probability of
his or her being enrolled in school at any particular future age is
equal to the current enrollment ratio at that age. Caution must be
maintained when utilizing this indicator in international comparisons.
For example, a year or grade completed in one country is not
necessarily the same in terms of educational content or quality as a
year or grade completed in another country. SLE represents the expected
number of years of schooling that will be completed, including years
spent repeating one or more grades.

Sex ratio:  This entry includes the number of males for each female in
five age groups - at birth, under 15 years, 15-64 years, 65 years and
over, and for the total population. Sex ratio at birth has recently
emerged as an indicator of certain kinds of sex discrimination in some
countries. For instance, high sex ratios at birth in some Asian
countries are now attributed to sex-selective abortion and infanticide
due to a strong preference for sons. This will affect future marriage
patterns and fertility patterns. Eventually, it could cause unrest
among young adult males who are unable to find partners.

Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad:  This entry gives the
cumulative US dollar value of all investments in foreign countries made
directly by residents - primarily companies - of the home country, as
of the end of the time period indicated. Direct investment excludes
investment through purchase of shares.

Stock of direct foreign investment - at home:  This entry gives the
cumulative US dollar value of all investments in the home country made
directly by residents - primarily companies - of other countries as of
the end of the time period indicated. Direct investment excludes
investment through purchase of shares.

Stock of domestic credit:  This entry is the total quantity of credit,
denominated in the domestic currency, provided by banks to nonbanking
institutions. The national currency units have been converted to US
dollars at the closing exchange rate on the date of the information.

Stock of money:  This entry, also known as "M1," comprises the total
quantity of currency in circulation (notes and coins) plus demand
deposits denominated in the national currency, held by nonbank
financial institutions, state and local governments, nonfinancial
public enterprises, and the private sector of the economy. The national
currency units have been converted to US dollars at the closing
exchange rate on the date of the information.

Stock of quasi money:  This entry comprises the total quantity of time
and savings deposits denominated in the national currency, held by
nonbank financial institutions, state and local governments,
nonfinancial public enterprises, and the private sector of the economy.
When added together with "M1" the total money supply is known as "M2."
The national currency units have been converted to US dollars at the
closing exchange rate on the date of the information.

Suffrage:  This entry gives the age at enfranchisement and whether the
right to vote is universal or restricted.

Telephone numbers:  All telephone numbers in The World Factbook consist
of the country code in brackets, the city or area code (where required)
in parentheses, and the local number. The one component that is not
presented is the international access code, which varies from country
to country. For example, an international direct dial telephone call
placed from the US to Madrid, Spain, would be as follows: 011 [34] (1)
577-xxxx, where 011 is the international access code for station-to-
station calls; 01 is for calls other than station-to-station calls,
[34] is the country code for Spain, (1) is the city code for Madrid,
577 is the local exchange, and xxxx is the local telephone number. An
international direct dial telephone call placed from another country to
the US would be as follows: international access code + [1] (202) 939-
xxxx, where [ 1] is the country code for the US, (202) is the area code
for Washington, DC, 939 is the local exchange, and xxxx is the local
telephone number.

Terminology:  Due to the highly structured nature of the Factbook
database, some collective generic terms have to be used. For example,
the word Country in the Country name entry refers to a wide variety of
dependencies, areas of special sovereignty, uninhabited islands, and
other entities in addition to the traditional countries or independent
states. Military is also used as an umbrella term for various civil
defense, security, and defense activities in many entries. The
Independence entry includes the usual colonial independence dates and
former ruling states as well as other significant nationhood dates such
as the traditional founding date or the date of unification,
federation, confederation, establishment, or state succession that are
not strictly independence dates. Dependent areas have the nature of
their dependency status noted in this same entry.

Terrain:  This entry contains a brief description of the topography.

Time difference:  This entry is expressed in The World Factbook in two
ways. First, it is stated as the difference in hours between the
capital of an entity and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) during
Standard Time. Additionally, the difference in time between the capital
of an entity and that observed in Washington, D.C. is also provided.
Note that the time difference assumes both locations are simultaneously
observing Standard Time or Daylight Saving Time.

Time zones:  Ten countries (Australia, Brazil, Canada, Indonesia,
Kazakhstan, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Spain, and the United States)
and the island of Greenland observe more than one official time
depending on the number of designated time zones within their
boundaries. An illustration of time zones throughout the world and
within countries can be seen in the Standard Time Zones of the World
map included in the Reference Maps section of The World Factbook.

Total fertility rate:  This entry gives a figure for the average number
of children that would be born per woman if all women lived to the end
of their childbearing years and bore children according to a given
fertility rate at each age. The total fertility rate (TFR) is a more
direct measure of the level of fertility than the crude birth rate,
since it refers to births per woman. This indicator shows the potential
for population change in the country. A rate of two children per woman
is considered the replacement rate for a population, resulting in
relative stability in terms of total numbers. Rates above two children
indicate populations growing in size and whose median age is declining.
Higher rates may also indicate difficulties for families, in some
situations, to feed and educate their children and for women to enter
the labor force. Rates below two children indicate populations
decreasing in size and growing older. Global fertility rates are in
general decline and this trend is most pronounced in industrialized
countries, especially Western Europe, where populations are projected
to decline dramatically over the next 50 years.

Total renewable water resources:  This entry provides the long-term
average water availability for a country in cubic kilometers of
precipitation, recharged ground water, and surface inflows from
surrounding countries. The values have been adjusted to account for
overlap resulting from surface flow recharge of groundwater sources.
Total renewable water resources provides the water total available to a
country but does not include water resource totals that have been
reserved for upstream or downstream countries through international
agreements. Note that these values are averages and do not accurately
reflect the total available in any given year. Annual available
resources can vary greatly due to short-term and long-term climatic and
weather variations.

Trafficking in persons:  Trafficking in persons is modern-day slavery,
involving victims who are forced, defrauded, or coerced into labor or
sexual exploitation. The International Labor Organization (ILO), the UN
agency charged with addressing labor standards, employment, and social
protection issues, estimates that 12.3 million people worldwide are
enslaved in forced labor, bonded labor, forced child labor, sexual
servitude, and involuntary servitude at any given time. Human
trafficking is a multi-dimensional threat, depriving people of their
human rights and freedoms, risking global health, promoting social
breakdown, inhibiting development by depriving countries of their human
capital, and helping fuel the growth of organized crime. In 2000, the
US Congress passed the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA),
reauthorized in 2003 and 2005, which provides tools for the US to
combat trafficking in persons, both domestically and abroad. One of the
law's key components is the creation of the US Department of State's
annual Trafficking in Persons Report, which assesses the government
response (i.e., the current situation) in some 150 countries with a
significant number of victims trafficked across their borders who are
recruited, harbored, transported, provided, or obtained for forced
labor or sexual exploitation. Countries in the annual report are rated
in three tiers, based on government efforts to combat trafficking. The
countries identified in this entry are those listed in the 2007
Trafficking in Persons Report as Tier 2 Watch List or Tier 3 based on
the following tier rating definitions:

Tier 2 Watch List countries do not fully comply with the minimum
standards for the elimination of trafficking but are making significant
efforts to do so, and meet one of the following criteria:

1. they display high or significantly increasing number of victims,

2. they have failed to provide evidence of increasing efforts to combat
trafficking in persons, or,

3. they have committed to take action over the next year.

Tier 3 countries neither satisfy the minimum standards for the
elimination of trafficking nor demonstrate a significant effort to do
so. Countries in this tier are subject to potential non-humanitarian
and non-trade sanctions.

Transnational issues:  This category includes four entries - Disputes -
international, Refugees and internally displaced persons, Trafficking
in persons, and Illicit drugs - that deal with current issues going
beyond national boundaries.

Transportation:  This category includes the entries dealing with the
means for movement of people and goods.

Transportation - note:  This entry includes miscellaneous
transportation information of significance not included elsewhere.

UTC (Coordinated Universal Time):  See entry for Coordinated Universal
Time.

Unemployment rate:  This entry contains the percent of the labor force
that is without jobs. Substantial underemployment might be noted.

Waterways:  This entry gives the total length of navigable rivers,
canals, and other inland bodies of water.

Weights and Measures:  This information is presented in Appendix G:
Weights and Measures and includes mathematical notations (mathematical
powers and names), metric interrelationships (prefix; symbol; length,
weight, or capacity; area; volume), and standard conversion factors.

Years:  All year references are for the calendar year (CY) unless
indicated as fiscal year (FY). The calendar year is an accounting
period of 12 months from 1 January to 31 December. The fiscal year is
an accounting period of 12 months other than 1 January to 31 December.

CIA - The World Factbook -- History


A Brief History of Basic Intelligence and The World Factbook


The Intelligence Cycle is the process by which information is acquired,
converted into intelligence, and made available to policymakers.
Information is raw data from any source, data that may be fragmentary,
contradictory, unreliable, ambiguous, deceptive, or wrong. Intelligence
is information that has been collected, integrated, evaluated,
analyzed, and interpreted. Finished intelligence is the final product
of the Intelligence Cycle ready to be delivered to the policymaker.

The three types of finished intelligence are: basic, current, and
estimative. Basic intelligence provides the fundamental and factual
reference material on a country or issue. Current intelligence reports
on new developments. Estimative intelligence judges probable outcomes.
The three are mutually supportive: basic intelligence is the foundation
on which the other two are constructed; current intelligence
continually updates the inventory of knowledge; and estimative
intelligence revises overall interpretations of country and issue
prospects for guidance of basic and current intelligence. The World
Factbook , The President's Daily Brief , and the National Intelligence
Estimates are examples of the three types of finished intelligence.

The United States has carried on foreign intelligence activities since
the days of George Washington but only since World War II have they
been coordinated on a government-wide basis. Three programs have
highlighted the development of coordinated basic intelligence since
that time: (1 ) the Joint Army Navy Intelligence Studies (JANIS), (2 )
the National Intelligence Survey ( NIS ), and (3) The World Factbook .

During World War II, intelligence consumers realized that the
production of basic intelligence by different components of the US
Government resulted in a great duplication of effort and conflicting
information. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 brought home
to leaders in Congress and the executive branch the need for
integrating departmental reports to national policymakers. Detailed and
coordinated information was needed not only on such major powers as
Germany and Japan , but also on places of little previous interest. In
the Pacific Theater, for example, the Navy and Marines had to launch
amphibious operations against many islands about which information was
unconfirmed or nonexistent. Intelligence authorities resolved that the
United States should never again be caught unprepared.

In 1943, Gen. George B. Strong (G-2), Adm. H. C. Train (Office of Naval
Intelligence--ONI), and Gen. William J. Donovan (Director of the Office
of Strategic Services--OSS ) decided that a joint effort should be
initiated. A steering committee was appointed on 27 April 1943 that
recommended the formation of a Joint Intelligence Study Publishing
Board to assemble, edit, coordinate, and publish the Joint Army Navy
Intelligence Studies (JANIS). JANIS was the first interdepartmental
basic intelligence program to fulfill the needs of the US Government
for an authoritative and coordinated appraisal of strategic basic
intelligence. Between April 1943 and July 1947, the board published 34
JANIS studies. JANIS performed well in the war effort, and numerous
letters of commendation were received, including a statement from Adm.
Forrest Sherman, Chief of Staff, Pacific Ocean Areas, which said,
"JANIS has become the indispensable reference work for the shore-based
planners."

The need for more comprehensive basic intelligence in the postwar world
was well expressed in 1946 by George S. Pettee, a noted author on
national security. He wrote in The Future of American Secret
Intelligence (Infantry Journal Press, 1946, page 46) that world
leadership in peace requires even more elaborate intelligence than in
war. "The conduct of peace involves all countries, all human
activities--not just the enemy and his war production."

The Central Intelligence Agency was established on 26 July 1947 and
officially began operating on 18 September 1947. Effective 1 October
1947, the Director of Central Intelligence assumed operational
responsibility for JANIS. On 13 January 1948, the National Security
Council issued Intelligence Directive (NSCID) No. 3, which authorized
the National Intelligence Survey ( NIS ) program as a peacetime
replacement for the wartime JANIS program. Before adequate NIS country
sections could be produced, government agencies had to develop more
comprehensive gazetteers and better maps. The US Board on Geographic
Names (BGN) compiled the names; the Department of the Interior produced
the gazetteers; and CIA produced the maps.

The Hoover Commission's Clark Committee, set up in 1954 to study the
structure and administration of the CIA, reported to Congress in 1955
that: "The National Intelligence Survey is an invaluable publication
which provides the essential elements of basic intelligence on all
areas of the world. There will always be a continuing requirement for
keeping the Survey up-to-date." The Factbook was created as an annual
summary and update to the encyclopedic NIS studies. The first
classified Factbook was published in August 1962, and the first
unclassified version was published in June 1971. The NIS program was
terminated in 1973 except for the Factbook , map, and gazetteer
components. The 1975 Factbook was the first to be made available to the
public with sales through the US Government Printing Office (GPO). The
Factbook was first made available on the Internet in June 1997. The
year 2008 marks the 61st anniversary of the establishment of the
Central Intelligence Agency and the 65th year of continuous basic
intelligence support to the US Government by The World Factbook and its
two predecessor programs.

Official Exchange Rates (OER) in addition to GDP at purchasing power
parity (PPP).

2007--In the Government category, the Capital entry significantly
expanded with up to four subfields, including new information having to
do with time. The subfields consist of the name of the capital itself,
its geographic coordinates , the time difference at the capital from
coordinated universal time (UTC), and, if applicable, information on
daylight saving time (DST). Where appropriate, a special note is added
to highlight those countries with multiple time zones. A Trafficking in
persons entry added to the Transnational issues category. A new
appendix, Weights and Measures, (re)introduced to the online version of
the Factbook.

General


Can you provide additional information for a specific country?

The staff cannot provide data beyond what appears in The World
Factbook. The format and information in the Factbook are tailored to
the specific requirements of US Government officials and content is
focused on their current and anticipated needs. The staff welcomes
suggestions for new entries.

How often is The World Factbook updated?

Formerly our Web site (and the published Factbook) were only updated
annually. Beginning in November 2001 we instituted a new system of
more frequent online updates. The World Factbook is currently
updated every two weeks.

The annual printed version of the Factbook is usually released about
midyear. US Government officials may obtain information about
Factbook availability from their own organizations or through
liaison channels to the CIA. Other users may obtain sales
information through the following channels:

Can I use some or all of The World Factbook for my Web site (book,
research project, homework, etc.)?

The World Factbook is in the public domain and may be used freely by
anyone at anytime without seeking permission. However, US Code
prohibits use of the CIA seal in a manner which implies that the CIA
approved, endorsed, or authorized such use. If you have any
questions about your intended use, you should consult with legal
counsel. Further information on The World Factbook's use is
described on the Contributors and Copyright Information page. As a
courtesy, please cite The World Factbook when used.

Why doesn't The World Factbook include information on states,
departments, provinces, etc., in the country format?

The World Factbook provides national-level information on countries,
territories, and dependencies, but not subnational administrative
units within a country. A good encyclopedia should provide
state/province-level information.

Is it possible to access older editions of The World Factbook to do
comparative research and trend analysis?

Previous versions of the Factbook, beginning with the 2000 edition,
are available for downloading - but not browsing - on the CIA Web
site. Hardcopy editions for earlier years are available from
libraries.

Would it be possible to set up a partnership or collaboration
between the producers of The World Factbook and other organizations
or individuals?

The World Factbook does not partner with other organizations or
individuals, but we do welcome comments and suggestions that such
groups or persons choose to provide.



Geography


I can't find a geographic name for a particular country. Why not?

The World Factbook is not a gazetteer (a dictionary or index of
places, usually with descriptive or statistical information) and
cannot provide more than the names of the administrative divisions
(in the Government category) and major cities/towns (on the country
maps). Our expanded Cross-Reference List of Geographic Names,
however, includes many of the world's major geographic features as
well as historic (former) names of countries and cities mentioned in
The World Factbook.

Why are Taiwan and the European Union listed out of alphabetical
order at the end of the Factbook entries?

Taiwan is listed after the regular entries because even though the
mainland People's Republic of China claims Taiwan, elected Taiwanese
authorities de facto administer the island and reject mainland
sovereignty claims. With the establishment of diplomatic relations
with China on January 1, 1979, the US Government recognized the
People's Republic of China as the sole legal government of China,
acknowledging the Chinese position that there is only one China and
that Taiwan is part of China.

The European Union (EU) is not a country, but it has taken on many
nation-like attributes and these are likely to be expanded in the
future. A more complete explanation on the inclusion of the EU into
the Factbook may be found in the Preliminary statement.

Since we have an ambassador who represents the US at the Vatican,
why is this entity not listed in the Factbook?

Vatican City is found under Holy See. The term "Holy See" refers to
the authority, jurisdiction, and sovereignty vested in the Pope and
his advisors to direct the worldwide Catholic Church. The Holy See
has a legal personality that allows it to enter into treaties as the
juridical equal of a state and to send and receive diplomatic
representatives. Vatican City, created in 1929 to administer
properties belonging to the Holy See in Rome, is recognized under
international law as a sovereign state, but it does not send or
receive diplomatic representatives. Consequently, Holy See is
included as a Factbook entry, with Vatican City cross-referenced in
the Geographic Names appendix.

Why is Palestine not listed in The World Factbook?

The areas that could potentially form a future Palestinian state --
the West Bank and Gaza Strip -- do appear in the Factbook. These
areas are presently Israeli-occupied with current status subject to
the Israeli-Palestinian 1995 Interim Agreement; their permanent
status is to be determined through further negotiation.

Why are the Golan Heights not shown as part of Israel or Northern
Cyprus with Turkey?

Territorial occupations/annexations not recognized by the United
States Government are not shown on US Government maps.

Why don't you include information on entities such as Tibet or
Kashmir?

The World Factbook provides information on the administrative
divisions of a country as recommended by the United States Board on
Geographic Names (BGN). The BGN is a component of the US Government
that develops policies, principles, and procedures governing the
spelling, use, and application of geographic names--domestic,
foreign, Antarctic, and undersea. Its decisions enable all
departments and agencies of the US Government to have access to
uniform names of geographic features.

Also included in the Factbook are entries on parts of the world
whose status has not yet been resolved (e.g., West Bank, Spratly
Islands). Specific regions within a country or areas in dispute
among countries are not covered.

What do you mean when you say that a country is "doubly landlocked"?

A doubly landlocked country is one that is separated from an ocean
or an ocean-accessible sea by two intervening countries. Uzbekistan
and Liechtenstein are the only countries that fit this definition.

Why is the area of the United States described as "slightly larger
than China" in the Factbook , while other sources list China as
larger in area than the United States?

It all depends on whether one is looking at total area (land and
water) when making the comparison (which is the criterion used by
the Factbook) or just land area (which excludes inland water
features such as rivers or lakes).

Total area (combining land and water)

United States = 9,826,630 sq km
China = 9,596,960 sq km

Land only (without any water features)

United States = 9,161,923 sq km
China = 9,326,410 sq km

Why has The World Factbook dropped the four French departments of
Guadeloupe, Martinique, Reunion, and French Guiana?

The reason the four entities are no longer in The World Factbook is
because their status has changed. While they are overseas
departments of France, they are also now recognized as French
regions, having equal status to the 22 metropolitan regions that
make up European France. In other words, they are now recognized as
being part of France proper. Their status is somewhat analogous to
Alaska and Hawaii vis-a-vis the contiguous United States. Although
separated from the larger geographic entity, they are still
considered to be an integral part of it.


Spelling and Pronunciation

Why is the spelling of proper names such as rulers, presidents, and
prime ministers in The World Factbook different than their spelling
in my country?

The Factbook staff applies the names and spellings from the Chiefs
of State link on the CIA Web site. The World Factbook is prepared
using the standard American English computer keyboard and does not
use any special characters, symbols, or most diacritical markings in
its spellings. Surnames are always spelled with capital letters;
they may appear first in some cultures.

The spelling of geographic names, features, cities, administrative
divisions, etc. in the Factbook differs from those used in my
country. Why is this?

The United States Board on Geographic Names (BGN) recommends and
approves names and spellings. The BGN is the component of the United
States Government that develops policies, principles, and procedures
governing the spelling, use, and application of geographic
names--domestic, foreign, Antarctic, and undersea. Its decisions
enable all departments and agencies of the US Government to use
uniform names of geographic features. (A note is usually included
where changes may have occurred but have not yet been approved by
the BGN). The World Factbook is prepared using the standard American
English computer keyboard and does not use any special characters,
symbols, or most diacritical markings in its spellings.

Why doesn't The World Factbook include pronunciations of country or
leader names?

There are too many variations in pronunciation among
English-speaking countries, not to mention English renditions of
non-English names, for pronunciations to be included. American
English pronunciations are included for some countries like Qatar
and Kiribati.

Why is the name of the Labour party misspelled?

When American and British spellings of common English words differ,
The World Factbook always uses the American spelling, even when
these common words form part of a proper name in British English.


Policies and Procedures

What is The World Factbook's source for a specific subject field?

The Factbook staff uses many different sources to publish what we
judge are the most reliable and consistent data for any particular
category. Space considerations preclude a listing of these various
sources.

The names of some geographic features provided in the Factbook
differ from those used in other publications. For example, in Asia
the Factbook has Burma as the country name, but in other
publications Myanmar is used; also, the Factbook uses Sea of Japan
whereas other publications label it East Sea. What is your policy on
naming geographic features?

The Factbook staff follows the guidance of the United States Board
on Geographic Names (BGN). The BGN is the component of the United
States Government that develops policies, principles, and procedures
governing the spelling, use, and application of geographic
names--domestic, foreign, Antarctic, and undersea. Its decisions
enable all departments and agencies of the US Government to have
access to uniform names of geographic features. The position of the
BGN is that the names Burma and Sea of Japan be used in official US
Government maps and publications.

Why is most of the statistical information in the Factbook given in
metric units, rather than the units standard to US measure?

US Federal agencies are required by the Metric Conversion Act of
1975 (Public Law 94-168) and by Executive Order 12770 of July 1991
to use the International System of Units, commonly referred to as
the metric system or SI. In addition, the metric system is used by
over 95 percent of the world's population.

Why don't you include information on minimum and maximum temperature
extremes?

The Factbook staff judges that this information would only be useful
for some (generally smaller) countries. Larger countries can have
large temperature extremes that do not represent the landmass as a
whole. In the future, such a category may be adopted listing the
extremes, but also adding a normal temperature range found
throughout most of a country's territory.

What information sources are used for the country flags?

Flag designs used in The World Factbook are those recognized by the
protocol office of the US Department of State.

Why do your GDP (Gross Domestic Product) statistics differ from
other sources?

We have two sets of GDP dollar estimates in The World Factbook , one
derived from purchasing power parity (PPP) calculations and the
other derived using official exchange rates (OER). Other sources
probably use one of the two. See the Notes and Definitions section
on GDP and GDP methodology for more information.

On the CIA Web site, Chiefs of State is updated weekly, but the last
update for the Factbook was an earlier date. Why the discrepancy?

Although Chiefs of State and The World Factbook both appear on the
CIA Web site, they are produced and updated by separate staffs.
Chiefs of State includes fewer countries but more leaders, and is
updated more frequently than The World Factbook, which has a much
larger database, and includes all countries.

Some percentage distributions do not add to 100. Why not?

Because of rounding, percentage distributions do not always add
precisely to 100%. Rounding of numbers always results in a loss of
precision--i.e., error. This error becomes apparent when percentage
data are totaled, as the following two examples show:




                Original Data      Rounded to whole integer

Example 1                43.2                            43
                         30.4                            30
                         26.4                            26
                         ----                            --
                        100.0                            99

Example 2                42.8                            43
                         31.6                            32
                         25.6                            26
                         ----                            --
                        100.0                           101


When this occurs, we do not force the numbers to add exactly to 100,
because doing so would introduce additional error into the
distribution.

What rounding convention does The World Factbook use?

In deciding on the number of digits to present, the Factbook staff
assesses the accuracy of the original data and the needs of US
Government officials. All of the economic data are processed by
computer--either at the source or by the Factbook staff. The economic
data presented in The Factbook, therefore, follow the rounding
convention used by virtually all numerical software applications,
namely, any digit followed by a "5" is rounded up to the next higher
digit, no matter whether the original digit is even or odd. Thus,
for example, when rounded to the nearest integer, 2.5 becomes 3,
rather than 2, as occurred in some pre-computer rounding systems.

Why do you list "Independence" dates for countries like France,
Germany, and the United Kingdom?

For most countries, this entry presents the date that sovereignty
was achieved and from which nation, empire, or trusteeship. For
other countries, the date may be some other significant nationhood
event such as the traditional founding date or the date of
unification, federation, confederation, establishment, or state
succession and so may not strictly be an "Independence" date.
Dependent entities have the nature of their dependency status noted
in this same entry.


Technical

Does The World Factbook comply with Section 508 of the
Rehabilitation Act regarding accessibility of Web pages?

The World Factbook home page has a link entitled "Text/Low Bandwidth
Version." The country data in the text version is fully accessible.
We believe The World Factbook is compliant with the Section 508 law
in both fact and spirit. If you are experiencing difficulty, please
use our comment form to provide us details of the specific problem
you are experiencing and the assistive software and/or hardware that
you are using so that we can work with our technical support staff
to find and implement a solution. We welcome visitors' suggestions
to improve accessibility of The World Factbook and the CIA Web site.

I am using the Factbook online and it is not working. What is wrong?

Hundreds of "Factbook" look-alikes exist on the Internet. The
Factbook site at: www.cia.gov is the only official site.

When I attempt to download a PDF (Portable Document Format) map file
(or some other map) the file has no image. Can you fix this?

Some of the files on The World Factbook Web site are large and could
take several minutes to download on a dial-up connection. The screen
might be blank during the download process.

When I open a map on The World Factbook site, it is fuzzy or
granular, or too big or too small. Why?

Adjusting the resolution setting on your monitor should correct this
problem.

Is The World Factbook country data available in machine-readable
format? All I can find is HTML, but I'm looking for simple tabular
data.

The Factbook Web site now features "Rank Order" pages for selected
Factbook entries. "Rank Order" pages are available for those data
fields identified with a small bar chart icon located next to the
title of the data entry. In addition, all of the "Rank Order" pages
can be downloaded as tab-delimited data files that can be opened in
other applications such as spreadsheets and databases.

Introduction
Afghanistan



Background:

Ahmad Shah DURRANI unified the Pashtun tribes and founded
Afghanistan in 1747. The country served as a buffer between the
British and Russian empires until it won independence from notional
British control in 1919. A brief experiment in democracy ended in a
1973 coup and a 1978 Communist counter-coup. The Soviet Union
invaded in 1979 to support the tottering Afghan Communist regime,
touching off a long and destructive war. The USSR withdrew in 1989
under relentless pressure by internationally supported
anti-Communist mujahedin rebels. A series of subsequent civil wars
saw Kabul finally fall in 1996 to the Taliban, a hardline
Pakistani-sponsored movement that emerged in 1994 to end the
country's civil war and anarchy. Following the 11 September 2001
terrorist attacks in New York City, a US, Allied, and anti-Taliban
Northern Alliance military action toppled the Taliban for sheltering
Osama BIN LADIN. The UN-sponsored Bonn Conference in 2001
established a process for political reconstruction that included the
adoption of a new constitution, a presidential election in 2004, and
National Assembly elections in 2005. In December 2004, Hamid KARZAI
became the first democratically elected president of Afghanistan and
the National Assembly was inaugurated the following December.
Despite gains toward building a stable central government, a
resurgent Taliban and continuing provincial instability -
particularly in the south and the east - remain serious challenges
for the Afghan Government.

Economy
Afghanistan



Economy - overview:

Afghanistan's economy is recovering from decades of conflict. The
economy has improved significantly since the fall of the Taliban
regime in 2001 largely because of the infusion of international
assistance, the recovery of the agricultural sector, and service
sector growth. Real GDP growth exceeded 7% in 2007. Despite the
progress of the past few years, Afghanistan is extremely poor,
landlocked, and highly dependent on foreign aid, agriculture, and
trade with neighboring countries. Much of the population continues
to suffer from shortages of housing, clean water, electricity,
medical care, and jobs. Criminality, insecurity, and the Afghan
Government's inability to extend rule of law to all parts of the
country pose challenges to future economic growth. It will probably
take the remainder of the decade and continuing donor aid and
attention to significantly raise Afghanistan's living standards from
its current level, among the lowest in the world. International
pledges made by more than 60 countries and international financial
institutions at the Berlin Donors Conference for Afghan
reconstruction in March 2004 reached $8.9 billion for 2004-09. While
the international community remains committed to Afghanistan's
development, pledging over $24 billion at three donors' conferences
since 2002, Kabul will need to overcome a number of challenges.
Expanding poppy cultivation and a growing opium trade generate
roughly $4 billion in illicit economic activity and looms as one of
Kabul's most serious policy concerns. Other long-term challenges
include: budget sustainability, job creation, corruption, government
capacity, and rebuilding war torn infrastructure.

Transnational Issues
Afghanistan



Disputes - international:

Refugees and internally displaced persons:

IDPs: 132,246 (mostly Pashtuns and Kuchis displaced in south and
west due to drought and instability) (2007)


Illicit drugs:

world's largest producer of opium; poppy cultivation increased 17%
to a near-record 202,000 hectares in 2007; good growing conditions
pushed potential opium production to a record 8,000 metric tons, up
42% from last year; if the entire opium crop were processed, 947
metric tons of heroin potentially could be produced; drug trade is a
source of instability and the Taliban and other antigovernment
groups participate in and profit from the drug trade; widespread
corruption impedes counterdrug efforts; most of the heroin consumed

@Albania

Introduction
Albania



Background:

Albania declared its independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1912,
but was conquered by Italy in 1939. Communist partisans took over
the country in 1944. Albania allied itself first with the USSR
(until 1960), and then with China (to 1978). In the early 1990s,
Albania ended 46 years of xenophobic Communist rule and established
a multiparty democracy. The transition has proven challenging as
successive governments have tried to deal with high unemployment,
widespread corruption, a dilapidated physical infrastructure,
powerful organized crime networks, and combative political
opponents. Albania has made progress in its democratic development
since first holding multiparty elections in 1991, but deficiencies
remain. International observers judged elections to be largely free
and fair since the restoration of political stability following the
collapse of pyramid schemes in 1997. In the 2005 general elections,
the Democratic Party and its allies won a decisive victory on
pledges of reducing crime and corruption, promoting economic growth,
and decreasing the size of government. The election, and
particularly the orderly transition of power, was considered an
important step forward. Although Albania's economy continues to
grow, the country is still one of the poorest in Europe, hampered by
a large informal economy and an inadequate energy and transportation
infrastructure. Albania has played a largely helpful role in
managing inter-ethnic tensions in southeastern Europe, and is
continuing to work toward joining NATO and the EU. Albania, with
troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, has been a strong supporter of the
global war on terrorism.

Economy
Albania



Economy - overview:

Lagging behind its Balkan neighbors, Albania is making the difficult
transition to a more modern open-market economy. The government has
taken measures to curb violent crime, and recently adopted a fiscal
reform package aimed at reducing the large gray economy and
attracting foreign investment. The economy is bolstered by annual
remittances from abroad of $600-$800 million, mostly from Albanians
residing in Greece and Italy; this helps offset the towering trade
deficit. Agriculture, which accounts for more than one-fifth of GDP,
is held back because of lack of modern equipment, unclear property
rights, and the prevalence of small, inefficient plots of land.
Energy shortages and antiquated and inadequate infrastructure
contribute to Albania's poor business environment, which make it
difficult to attract and sustain foreign investment. The completion
of a new thermal power plant near Vlore and improved transmission
line between Albania and Montenegro will help relieve the energy
shortages. Also, the government is moving slowly to improve the poor
national road and rail network, a long-standing barrier to sustained
economic growth. On the positive side, macroeconomic growth was
strong in 2003-07 and inflation is low and stable.

Transnational Issues
Albania



Disputes - international:

the Albanian Government calls for the protection of the rights of
ethnic Albanians in neighboring countries, and the peaceful
resolution of interethnic disputes; some ethnic Albanian groups in
neighboring countries advocate for a "greater Albania," but the idea
has little appeal among Albanian nationals; the mass emigration of
unemployed Albanians remains a problem for developed countries,
chiefly Greece and Italy


Trafficking in persons:

current situation: Albania is a source country for women and girls
trafficked for the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation and
forced labor; it is no longer considered a major country of transit;
Albanian victims are trafficked to Greece, Italy, Macedonia, and
Kosovo, with many trafficked onward to Western European countries;
children were also trafficked to Greece for begging and other forms
of child labor; approximately half of all Albanian trafficking
victims are under age 18; internal sex trafficking of women and
children is on the rise
tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Albania is on the Tier 2 Watch List
for its failure to provide evidence of increasing efforts to combat
trafficking in persons in 2007, particularly in the area of victim
protection; the government did not appropriately identify
trafficking victims during 2007, and has not demonstrated that it is
vigorously investigating or prosecuting complicit officials (2008)


Illicit drugs:

increasingly active transshipment point for Southwest Asian opiates,
hashish, and cannabis transiting the Balkan route and - to a lesser
extent - cocaine from South America destined for Western Europe;
limited opium and growing cannabis production; ethnic Albanian
narcotrafficking organizations active and expanding in Europe;
vulnerable to money laundering associated with regional trafficking
in narcotics, arms, contraband, and illegal aliens

@Algeria

Introduction
Algeria



Background:

After more than a century of rule by France, Algerians fought
through much of the 1950s to achieve independence in 1962. Algeria's
primary political party, the National Liberation Front (FLN), has
dominated politics ever since. Many Algerians in the subsequent
generation were not satisfied, however, and moved to counter the
FLN's centrality in Algerian politics. The surprising first round
success of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) in the December 1991
balloting spurred the Algerian army to intervene and postpone the
second round of elections to prevent what the secular elite feared
would be an extremist-led government from assuming power. The army
began a crackdown on the FIS that spurred FIS supporters to begin
attacking government targets. The government later allowed elections
featuring pro-government and moderate religious-based parties, but
did not appease the activists who progressively widened their
attacks. The fighting escalated into an insurgency, which saw
intense fighting between 1992-98 and which resulted in over 100,000
deaths - many attributed to indiscriminate massacres of villagers by
extremists. The government gained the upper hand by the late-1990s
and FIS's armed wing, the Islamic Salvation Army, disbanded in
January 2000. However, small numbers of armed militants persist in
confronting government forces and conducting ambushes and occasional
attacks on villages. The army placed Abdelaziz BOUTEFLIKA in the
presidency in 1999 in a fraudulent election but claimed neutrality
in his 2004 landslide reelection victory. Longstanding problems
continue to face BOUTEFLIKA in his second term, including the ethnic
minority Berbers' ongoing autonomy campaign, large-scale
unemployment, a shortage of housing, unreliable electrical and water
supplies, government inefficiencies and corruption, and the
continuing activities of extremist militants. The 2006 merger of the
Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC) with al-Qaida
(followed by a name change to al-Qaida in the Lands of the Islamic
Maghreb) signaled an increase in bombings, including high-profile,
mass-casualty suicide attacks targeted against the Algerian
government and Western interests. Algeria must also diversify its
petroleum-based economy, which has yielded a large cash reserve but
which has not been used to redress Algeria's many social and
infrastructure problems.

Economy
Algeria



Economy - overview:

The hydrocarbons sector is the backbone of the economy, accounting
for roughly 60% of budget revenues, 30% of GDP, and over 95% of
export earnings. Algeria has the eighth-largest reserves of natural
gas in the world and is the fourth-largest gas exporter; it ranks
14th in oil reserves. Sustained high oil prices in recent years have
helped improve Algeria's financial and macroeconomic indicators.
Algeria is running substantial trade surpluses and building up
record foreign exchange reserves. Algeria has decreased its external
debt to less than 10% of GDP after repaying its Paris Club and
London Club debt in 2006. Real GDP has risen due to higher oil
output and increased government spending. The government's continued
efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic
investment outside the energy sector, however, has had little
success in reducing high unemployment and improving living
standards. Structural reform within the economy, such as development
of the banking sector and the construction of infrastructure, moves
ahead slowly hampered by corruption and bureaucratic resistance.

offset by the rapid increase in mobile cellular subscribership; in
2007, combined fixed-line and mobile telephone density surpassed 90
telephones per 100 persons
domestic: privatization of Algeria's telecommunications sector began
in 2000; three mobile cellular licenses have been issued and, in
2005, a consortium led by Egypt's Orascom Telecom won a 15-year
license to build and operate a fixed-line network in Algeria; the
license will allow Orascom to develop high-speed data and other
specialized services and contribute to meeting the large unfulfilled
demand for basic residential telephony; Internet broadband services
began in 2003 with approximately 200,000 subscribers in 2006

Transnational Issues
Algeria



Disputes - international:

Algeria, and many other states, rejects Moroccan administration of
Western Sahara; the Polisario Front, exiled in Algeria, represents
the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic; Algeria's border with Morocco
remains an irritant to bilateral relations, each nation accusing the
other of harboring militants and arms smuggling; Algeria remains
concerned about armed bandits operating throughout the Sahel who
sometimes destabilize southern Algerian towns; dormant disputes
include Libyan claims of about 32,000 sq km still reflected on its
maps of southeastern Algeria and the FLN's assertions of a claim to
Chirac Pastures in southeastern Morocco


Refugees and internally displaced persons:

refugees (country of origin): 90,000 (Western Saharan Sahrawi,
mostly living in Algerian-sponsored camps in the southwestern
Algerian town of Tindouf)
IDPs: undetermined (civil war during 1990s) (2007)


Trafficking in persons:

current situation: Algeria is a transit country for men and women
trafficked from sub-Saharan Africa to Europe for the purposes of
commercial sexual exploitation and involuntary servitude; Algerian
children are trafficked internally for the purpose of domestic
servitude or street vending
tier rating: Tier 3 - Algeria did not report any serious law
enforcement actions to punish traffickers who force women into
commercial sexual exploitation or men into involuntary servitude in
2007; the government again reported no investigations of trafficking
of children for domestic servitude or improvements in protection
services available to victims of trafficking; Algeria still lacks
victim protection services, and its failure to distinguish between
trafficking and illegal migration may result in the punishment of
victims of trafficking (2008)

@American Samoa

Introduction
American Samoa



Background:

Settled as early as 1000 B.C., Samoa was "discovered" by European
explorers in the 18th century. International rivalries in the latter
half of the 19th century were settled by an 1899 treaty in which
Germany and the US divided the Samoan archipelago. The US formally
occupied its portion - a smaller group of eastern islands with the
excellent harbor of Pago Pago - the following year.

Economy
American Samoa



Economy - overview:

American Samoa has a traditional Polynesian economy in which more
than 90% of the land is communally owned. Economic activity is
strongly linked to the US with which American Samoa conducts most of
its commerce. Tuna fishing and tuna processing plants are the
backbone of the private sector, with canned tuna the primary export.
Transfers from the US Government add substantially to American
Samoa's economic well being. Attempts by the government to develop a
larger and broader economy are restrained by Samoa's remote
location, its limited transportation, and its devastating
hurricanes. Tourism is a promising developing sector.
note: as a territory of the US, American Samoa does not treat the US
as an external trade partner

@Andorra

Introduction
Andorra



Background:

For 715 years, from 1278 to 1993, Andorrans lived under a unique
co-principality, ruled by French and Spanish leaders (from 1607
onward, the French chief of state and the Spanish bishop of Urgel).
In 1993, this feudal system was modified with the titular heads of
state retained, but the government transformed into a parliamentary
democracy. Long isolated and impoverished, mountainous Andorra
achieved considerable prosperity since World War II through its
tourist industry. Many immigrants (legal and illegal) are attracted
to the thriving economy with its lack of income taxes.

Economy
Andorra



Economy - overview:

Tourism, the mainstay of Andorra's tiny, well-to-do economy,
accounts for more than 80% of GDP. An estimated 11.6 million
tourists visit annually, attracted by Andorra's duty-free status and
by its summer and winter resorts. Andorra's comparative advantage
has recently eroded as the economies of neighboring France and Spain
have been opened up, providing broader availability of goods and
lower tariffs. The banking sector, with its partial "tax haven"
status, also contributes substantially to the economy. Agricultural
production is limited - only 2% of the land is arable - and most
food has to be imported. The principal livestock activity is sheep
raising. Manufacturing output consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars,
and furniture. Andorra is a member of the EU Customs Union and is
treated as an EU member for trade in manufactured goods (no tariffs)
and as a non-EU member for agricultural products.

@Angola

Introduction
Angola



Background:

Angola is rebuilding its country after the end of a 27-year civil
war in 2002. Fighting between the Popular Movement for the
Liberation of Angola (MPLA), led by Jose Eduardo DOS SANTOS, and the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), led by
Jonas SAVIMBI, followed independence from Portugal in 1975. Peace
seemed imminent in 1992 when Angola held national elections, but
UNITA renewed fighting after being beaten by the MPLA at the polls.
Up to 1.5 million lives may have been lost - and 4 million people
displaced - in the quarter century of fighting. SAVIMBI's death in
2002 ended UNITA's insurgency and strengthened the MPLA's hold on
power. President DOS SANTOS has announced legislative elections will
be held in September 2008, with presidential elections planned for
sometime in 2009.

Economy
Angola



Economy - overview:

Angola's high growth rate is driven by its oil sector, with record
oil prices and rising petroleum production. Oil production and its
supporting activities contribute about 85% of GDP. Increased oil
production supported growth averaging more than 15% per year from
2004 to 2007. A postwar reconstruction boom and resettlement of
displaced persons has led to high rates of growth in construction
and agriculture as well. Much of the country's infrastructure is
still damaged or undeveloped from the 27-year-long civil war.
Remnants of the conflict such as widespread land mines still mar the
countryside even though an apparently durable peace was established
after the death of rebel leader Jonas SAVIMBI in February 2002.
Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for most of the
people, but half of the country's food must still be imported. In
2005, the government started using a $2 billion line of credit,
since increased to $7 billion, from China to rebuild Angola's public
infrastructure, and several large-scale projects were completed in
2006. Angola also has large credit lines from Brazil, Portugal,
Germany, Spain, and the EU. The central bank in 2003 implemented an
exchange rate stabilization program using foreign exchange reserves
to buy kwanzas out of circulation. This policy became more
sustainable in 2005 because of strong oil export earnings; it has
significantly reduced inflation. Although consumer inflation
declined from 325% in 2000 to under 13% in 2007, the stabilization
policy has put pressure on international net liquidity. Angola
became a member of OPEC in late 2006 and in late 2007 was assigned a
production quota of 1.9 million barrels a day, somewhat less than
the 2-2.5 million bbl Angola's government had wanted. To fully take
advantage of its rich national resources - gold, diamonds, extensive
forests, Atlantic fisheries, and large oil deposits - Angola will
need to implement government reforms, increase transparency, and
reduce corruption. The government has rejected a formal IMF
monitored program, although it continues Article IV consultations
and ad hoc cooperation. Corruption, especially in the extractive
sectors, and the negative effects of large inflows of foreign
exchange, are major challenges facing Angola.

Introduction
Anguilla



Background:

Colonized by English settlers from Saint Kitts in 1650, Anguilla was
administered by Great Britain until the early 19th century, when the
island - against the wishes of the inhabitants - was incorporated
into a single British dependency, along with Saint Kitts and Nevis.
Several attempts at separation failed. In 1971, two years after a
revolt, Anguilla was finally allowed to secede; this arrangement was
formally recognized in 1980, with Anguilla becoming a separate
British dependency.

Economy
Anguilla



Economy - overview:

Anguilla has few natural resources, and the economy depends heavily
on luxury tourism, offshore banking, lobster fishing, and
remittances from emigrants. Increased activity in the tourism
industry has spurred the growth of the construction sector,
contributing to economic growth. Anguillan officials have put
substantial effort into developing the offshore financial sector,
which is small, but growing. In the medium term, prospects for the
economy will depend largely on the tourism sector and, therefore, on
revived income growth in the industrialized nations as well as on
favorable weather conditions.

Introduction
Antarctica



Background:

Speculation over the existence of a "southern land" was not
confirmed until the early 1820s when British and American commercial
operators and British and Russian national expeditions began
exploring the Antarctic Peninsula region and other areas south of
the Antarctic Circle. Not until 1840 was it established that
Antarctica was indeed a continent and not just a group of islands.
Several exploration "firsts" were achieved in the early 20th
century. Following World War II, there was an upsurge in scientific
research on the continent. A number of countries have set up a range
of year-round and seasonal stations, camps, and refuges to support
scientific research in Antarctica. Seven have made territorial
claims, but not all countries recognize these claims. In order to
form a legal framework for the activities of nations on the
continent, an Antarctic Treaty was negotiated that neither denies
nor gives recognition to existing territorial claims; signed in
1959, it entered into force in 1961.


Geography
Antarctica



Location:

continent mostly south of the Antarctic Circle


Geographic coordinates:

90 00 S, 0 00 E


Map references:

Antarctic Region


Area:

total: 14 million sq km
land: 14 million sq km (280,000 sq km ice-free, 13.72 million sq km
ice-covered) (est.)
note: fifth-largest continent, following Asia, Africa, North
America, and South America, but larger than Australia and the
subcontinent of Europe


Area - comparative:

slightly less than 1.5 times the size of the US


Land boundaries:

0 km
note: see entry on Disputes - international


Coastline:

17,968 km


Maritime claims:

Australia, Chile, and Argentina claim Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)
rights or similar over 200 nm extensions seaward from their
continental claims, but like the claims themselves, these zones are
not accepted by other countries; 21 of 28 Antarctic consultative
nations have made no claims to Antarctic territory (although Russia
and the US have reserved the right to do so) and do not recognize
the claims of the other nations; also see the Disputes -
international entry


Climate:

severe low temperatures vary with latitude, elevation, and distance
from the ocean; East Antarctica is colder than West Antarctica
because of its higher elevation; Antarctic Peninsula has the most
moderate climate; higher temperatures occur in January along the
coast and average slightly below freezing


Terrain:

about 98% thick continental ice sheet and 2% barren rock, with
average elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters; mountain ranges
up to nearly 5,000 meters; ice-free coastal areas include parts of
southern Victoria Land, Wilkes Land, the Antarctic Peninsula area,
and parts of Ross Island on McMurdo Sound; glaciers form ice shelves
along about half of the coastline, and floating ice shelves
constitute 11% of the area of the continent


Elevation extremes:

lowest point: Bentley Subglacial Trench -2,555 m
highest point: Vinson Massif 4,897 m
note: the lowest known land point in Antarctica is hidden in the
Bentley Subglacial Trench; at its surface is the deepest ice yet
discovered and the world's lowest elevation not under seawater


Natural resources:

iron ore, chromium, copper, gold, nickel, platinum and other
minerals, and coal and hydrocarbons have been found in small
uncommercial quantities; none presently exploited; krill, finfish,
and crab have been taken by commercial fisheries


Land use:

arable land: 0%
permanent crops: 0%
other: 100% (ice 98%, barren rock 2%) (2005)


Natural hazards:

katabatic (gravity-driven) winds blow coastward from the high
interior; frequent blizzards form near the foot of the plateau;
cyclonic storms form over the ocean and move clockwise along the
coast; volcanism on Deception Island and isolated areas of West
Antarctica; other seismic activity rare and weak; large icebergs may
calve from ice shelf


Environment - current issues:

in 1998, NASA satellite data showed that the Antarctic ozone hole
was the largest on record, covering 27 million square kilometers;
researchers in 1997 found that increased ultraviolet light passing
through the hole damages the DNA of icefish, an Antarctic fish
lacking hemoglobin; ozone depletion earlier was shown to harm
one-celled Antarctic marine plants; in 2002, significant areas of
ice shelves disintegrated in response to regional warming


Geography - note:

the coldest, windiest, highest (on average), and driest continent;
during summer, more solar radiation reaches the surface at the South
Pole than is received at the Equator in an equivalent period; mostly
uninhabitable


People
Antarctica



Population:

no indigenous inhabitants, but there are both permanent and
summer-only staffed research stations
note: 28 nations, all signatory to the Antarctic Treaty, operate
through their National Antarctic Program a number of seasonal-only
(summer) and year-round research stations on the continent and its
nearby islands south of 60 degrees south latitude (the region
covered by the Antarctic Treaty); these stations' population of
persons doing and supporting science or engaged in the management
and protection of the Antarctic region varies from approximately
4,000 in summer to 1,000 in winter; in addition, approximately 1,000
personnel, including ship's crew and scientists doing onboard
research, are present in the waters of the treaty region; peak
summer (December-February) population - 4,219 total; Argentina 667,
Australia 200, Brazil 40, Bulgaria 15, Chile 237, China 70, Czech

resources agreement was signed in 1988 but remains unratified; the
Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty was
signed 4 October 1991 and entered into force 14 January 1998; this
agreement provides for the protection of the Antarctic environment
through six specific annexes: 1) environmental impact assessment, 2)
conservation of Antarctic fauna and flora, 3) waste disposal and
waste management, 4) prevention of marine pollution, 5) area
protection and management and 6) liability arising from
environmental emergencies; it prohibits all activities relating to
mineral resources except scientific research; a permanent Antarctic
Treaty Secretariat was established in 2004 in Buenos Aires, Argentina


Legal system:

Antarctica is administered through meetings of the consultative
member nations; decisions from these meetings are carried out by
these member nations (with respect to their own nationals and
operations) in accordance with their own national laws; US law,
including certain criminal offenses by or against US nationals, such
as murder, may apply extraterritorially; some US laws directly apply
to Antarctica; for example, the Antarctic Conservation Act, 16
U.S.C. section 2401 et seq., provides civil and criminal penalties
for the following activities, unless authorized by regulation of
statute: the taking of native mammals or birds; the introduction of
nonindigenous plants and animals; entry into specially protected
areas; the discharge or disposal of pollutants; and the importation
into the US of certain items from Antarctica; violation of the
Antarctic Conservation Act carries penalties of up to $10,000 in
fines and one year in prison; the National Science Foundation and
Department of Justice share enforcement responsibilities; Public Law
95-541, the US Antarctic Conservation Act of 1978, as amended in
1996, requires expeditions from the US to Antarctica to notify, in
advance, the Office of Oceans, Room 5805, Department of State,
Washington, DC 20520, which reports such plans to other nations as
required by the Antarctic Treaty; for more information, contact
Permit Office, Office of Polar Programs, National Science
Foundation, Arlington, Virginia 22230; telephone: (703) 292-8030, or
visit their website at www.nsf.gov; more generally, access to the
Antarctic Treaty area, that is to all areas between 60 and 90
degrees south latitude, is subject to a number of relevant legal
instruments and authorization procedures adopted by the states party
to the Antarctic Treaty


Economy
Antarctica



Economy - overview:

Fishing off the coast and tourism, both based abroad, account for
Antarctica's limited economic activity. Antarctic fisheries in
2005-06 (1 July-30 June) reported landing 128,081 metric tons
(estimated fishing from the area covered by the Convention on the
Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), which
extends slightly beyond the Antarctic Treaty area). Unregulated
fishing, particularly of Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus
eleginoides), is a serious problem. The CCAMLR determines the
recommended catch limits for marine species. A total of 36,460
tourists visited the Antarctic Treaty area in the 2006-07 Antarctic
summer, up from the 30,877 visitors the previous year (estimates
provided to the Antarctic Treaty by the International Association of
Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO); this does not include passengers
on overflights). Nearly all of them were passengers on commercial
(nongovernmental) ships and several yachts that make trips during
the summer. Most tourist trips last approximately two weeks.

reserve the right to make claims; no claims have been made in the
sector between 90 degrees west and 150 degrees west; the
International Whaling Commission created a sancturary around the
entire continent to deter catches by countries claiming to conduct
scientific whaling; Australia has established a similar preserve in
the waters around its territorial claim

@Antigua and Barbuda

Introduction
Antigua and Barbuda



Background:

The Siboney were the first to inhabit the islands of Antigua and
Barbuda in 2400 B.C., but Arawak Indians populated the islands when
COLUMBUS landed on his second voyage in 1493. Early settlements by
the Spanish and French were succeeded by the English who formed a
colony in 1667. Slavery, established to run the sugar plantations on
Antigua, was abolished in 1834. The islands became an independent
state within the British Commonwealth of Nations in 1981.

Economy
Antigua and Barbuda



Economy - overview:

Antigua has a relatively high GDP per capita in comparison to most
other Caribbean nations. It has experienced solid growth since 2003,
driven by a construction boom in hotels and housing that which
should wind down in 2008. Tourism continues to dominate the economy,
accounting for more than half of GDP. The dual-island nation's
agricultural production is focused on the domestic market and
constrained by a limited water supply and a labor shortage stemming
from the lure of higher wages in tourism and construction.
Manufacturing comprises enclave-type assembly for export with major
products being bedding, handicrafts, and electronic components.
Prospects for economic growth in the medium term will continue to
depend on income growth in the industrialized world, especially in
the US, which accounts for slightly more than one-third of tourist
arrivals. Since taking office in 2004, the SPENCER government has
adopted an ambitious fiscal reform program, but will continue to be
saddled by its debt burden with a debt-to-GDP ratio exceeding 100%.

@Arctic Ocean

Introduction
Arctic Ocean



Background:

The Arctic Ocean is the smallest of the world's five oceans (after
the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, and the recently
delimited Southern Ocean). The Northwest Passage (US and Canada) and
Northern Sea Route (Norway and Russia) are two important seasonal
waterways. A sparse network of air, ocean, river, and land routes
circumscribes the Arctic Ocean.


Geography
Arctic Ocean



Location:

body of water between Europe, Asia, and North America, mostly north
of the Arctic Circle


Geographic coordinates:

90 00 N, 0 00 E


Map references:

Arctic Region


Area:

total: 14.056 million sq km
note: includes Baffin Bay, Barents Sea, Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea,
East Siberian Sea, Greenland Sea, Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Kara
Sea, Laptev Sea, Northwest Passage, and other tributary water bodies


Area - comparative:

slightly less than 1.5 times the size of the US


Coastline:

45,389 km


Climate:

polar climate characterized by persistent cold and relatively narrow
annual temperature ranges; winters characterized by continuous
darkness, cold and stable weather conditions, and clear skies;
summers characterized by continuous daylight, damp and foggy
weather, and weak cyclones with rain or snow


Terrain:

central surface covered by a perennial drifting polar icepack that,
on average, is about 3 meters thick, although pressure ridges may be
three times that thickness; clockwise drift pattern in the Beaufort
Gyral Stream, but nearly straight-line movement from the New
Siberian Islands (Russia) to Denmark Strait (between Greenland and
Iceland); the icepack is surrounded by open seas during the summer,
but more than doubles in size during the winter and extends to the
encircling landmasses; the ocean floor is about 50% continental
shelf (highest percentage of any ocean) with the remainder a central
basin interrupted by three submarine ridges (Alpha Cordillera,
Nansen Cordillera, and Lomonosov Ridge)


Elevation extremes:

lowest point: Fram Basin -4,665 m
highest point: sea level 0 m


Natural resources:

sand and gravel aggregates, placer deposits, polymetallic nodules,
oil and gas fields, fish, marine mammals (seals and whales)


Natural hazards:

ice islands occasionally break away from northern Ellesmere Island;
icebergs calved from glaciers in western Greenland and extreme
northeastern Canada; permafrost in islands; virtually ice locked
from October to June; ships subject to superstructure icing from
October to May


Environment - current issues:

endangered marine species include walruses and whales; fragile
ecosystem slow to change and slow to recover from disruptions or
damage; thinning polar icepack


Geography - note:

major chokepoint is the southern Chukchi Sea (northern access to the
Pacific Ocean via the Bering Strait); strategic location between
North America and Russia; shortest marine link between the extremes
of eastern and western Russia; floating research stations operated
by the US and Russia; maximum snow cover in March or April about 20
to 50 centimeters over the frozen ocean; snow cover lasts about 10
months




Economy
Arctic Ocean



Economy - overview:

Economic activity is limited to the exploitation of natural
resources, including petroleum, natural gas, fish, and seals.



Transportation
Arctic Ocean



Ports and terminals:

Churchill (Canada), Murmansk (Russia), Prudhoe Bay (US)


Transportation - note:

sparse network of air, ocean, river, and land routes; the Northwest
Passage (North America) and Northern Sea Route (Eurasia) are
important seasonal waterways



Transnational Issues
Arctic Ocean



Disputes - international:

the littoral states are engaged in various stages of demonstrating
the limits of their continental shelves beyond 200 nautical miles
from their declared baselines in accordance with Article 76,
paragraph 8, of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea;
record summer melting of sea ice in the Arctic has restimulated
interest in maritime shipping lanes and sea floor exploration

@Argentina

Introduction
Argentina



Background:

In 1816, the United Provinces of the Rio Plata declared their
independence from Spain. After Bolivia, Paraguay, and Uruguay went
their separate ways, the area that remained became Argentina. The
country's population and culture were heavily shaped by immigrants
from throughout Europe, but most particularly Italy and Spain, which
provided the largest percentage of newcomers from 1860 to 1930. Up
until about the mid-20th century, much of Argentina's history was
dominated by periods of internal political conflict between
Federalists and Unitarians and between civilian and military
factions. After World War II, an era of Peronist authoritarian rule
and interference in subsequent governments was followed by a
military junta that took power in 1976. Democracy returned in 1983,
and has persisted despite numerous challenges, the most formidable
of which was a severe economic crisis in 2001-02 that led to violent
public protests and the resignation of several interim presidents.
The economy has recovered strongly since bottoming out in 2002.

Economy
Argentina



Economy - overview:

Argentina benefits from rich natural resources, a highly literate
population, an export-oriented agricultural sector, and a
diversified industrial base. Although one of the world's wealthiest
countries 100 years ago, Argentina suffered during most of the 20th
century from recurring economic crises, persistent fiscal and
current account deficits, high inflation, mounting external debt,
and capital flight. A severe depression, growing public and external
indebtedness, and a bank run culminated in 2001 in the most serious
economic, social, and political crisis in the country's turbulent
history. Interim President Adolfo RODRIGUEZ SAA declared a default -
the largest in history - on the government's foreign debt in
December of that year, and abruptly resigned only a few days after
taking office. His successor, Eduardo DUHALDE, announced an end to
the peso's decade-long 1-to-1 peg to the US dollar in early 2002.
The economy bottomed out that year, with real GDP 18% smaller than
in 1998 and almost 60% of Argentines under the poverty line. Real
GDP rebounded to grow by an average 9% annually over the subsequent
five years, taking advantage of previously idled industrial capacity
and labor, an audacious debt restructuring and reduced debt burden,
excellent international financial conditions, and expansionary
monetary and fiscal policies. Inflation, however, reached
double-digit levels in 2006 and the government of President Nestor
KIRCHNER responded with "voluntary" price agreements with
businesses, as well as export taxes and restraints. Multi-year price
freezes on electricity and natural gas rates for residential users
stoked consumption and kept private investment away, leading to
restrictions on industrial use and blackouts in 2007.

general assessment: by opening the telecommunications market to
competition and foreign investment with the "Telecommunications
Liberalization Plan of 1998," Argentina encouraged the growth of
modern telecommunications technology; fiber-optic cable trunk lines
are being installed between all major cities; major networks are
entirely digital and the availability of telephone service is
improving; fixed-line telephone density is gradually increasing
reaching nearly 25 lines per 100 people in 2007; mobile telephone
subscribership has been increasing rapidly and has reached a level
of 100 telephones per 100 persons

Transnational Issues
Argentina



Disputes - international:

Argentina continues to assert its claims to the UK-administered
Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas), South Georgia, and the South
Sandwich Islands in its constitution, forcibly occupying the
Falklands in 1982, but in 1995 agreed no longer to seek settlement
by force; territorial claim in Antarctica partially overlaps UK and
Chilean claims; unruly region at convergence of
Argentina-Brazil-Paraguay borders is locus of money laundering,
smuggling, arms and illegal narcotics trafficking, and fundraising
for extremist organizations; uncontested dispute between Brazil and
Uruguay over Braziliera/Brasiliera Island in the Quarai/Cuareim
River leaves the tripoint with Argentina in question; in 2006,
Argentina went to the ICJ to protest, on environmental grounds, the
construction of two pulp mills in Uruguay on the Uruguay River,
which forms the boundary; both parties presented their pleadings in
2007 with Argentina's reply in January and Uruguay's rejoinder in
July 2008; the joint boundary commission, established by Chile and
Argentina in 2001 has yet to map and demarcate the delimited
boundary in the inhospitable Andean Southern Ice Field (Campo de
Hielo Sur)


Trafficking in persons:

current situation: Argentina is a source, transit, and destination
country for men, women, and children trafficked for the purposes of
commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor; most victims are
trafficked within the country, from rural to urban areas; child sex
tourism is a problem; foreign women and children, primarily from
Paraguay, Brazil, and the Dominican Republic, are trafficked to
Argentina for commercial sexual exploitation; Argentine women and
girls are also trafficked to neighboring countries, Mexico, and
Western Europe for sexual exploitation; a significant number of
Bolivians, Peruvians, and Paraguayans are trafficked into the
country for forced labor in sweatshops, agriculture, and as domestic
servants
tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - despite some progress, Argentina
remains on the Tier 2 Watch List for the third consecutive year for
its failure to show evidence of increasing efforts to combat human
trafficking, particularly in terms of providing adequate assistance
to victims and curbing official complicity with trafficking
activity, especially on the provincial and local levels; the
Argentine Congress has demonstrated progress by enacting much-needed
and first-ever federal anti-trafficking legislation (2008)


Illicit drugs:

a transshipment country for cocaine headed for Europe; some
money-laundering activity, especially in the Tri-Border Area; law
enforcement corruption; a source for precursor chemicals; increasing
domestic consumption of drugs in urban centers, especially cocaine
base and synthetic drugs

Introduction
Armenia



Background:

Armenia prides itself on being the first nation to formally adopt
Christianity (early 4th century). Despite periods of autonomy, over
the centuries Armenia came under the sway of various empires
including the Roman, Byzantine, Arab, Persian, and Ottoman. During
World War I in the western portion of Armenia, Ottoman Turkey
instituted a policy of forced resettlement coupled with other harsh
practices that resulted in an estimated 1 million Armenian deaths.
The eastern area of Armenia was ceded by the Ottomans to Russia in
1828; this portion declared its independence in 1918, but was
conquered by the Soviet Red Army in 1920. Armenian leaders remain
preoccupied by the long conflict with Muslim Azerbaijan over
Nagorno-Karabakh, a primarily Armenian-populated region, assigned to
Soviet Azerbaijan in the 1920s by Moscow. Armenia and Azerbaijan
began fighting over the area in 1988; the struggle escalated after
both countries attained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.
By May 1994, when a cease-fire took hold, Armenian forces held not
only Nagorno-Karabakh but also a significant portion of Azerbaijan
proper. The economies of both sides have been hurt by their
inability to make substantial progress toward a peaceful resolution.
Turkey imposed an economic blockade on Armenia and closed the common
border because of the Armenian separatists' control of
Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding areas.

Economy
Armenia



Economy - overview:

Since the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, Armenia has made
progress in implementing many economic reforms including
privatization, price reforms, and prudent fiscal policies. The
conflict with Azerbaijan over the ethnic Armenian-dominated region
of Nagorno-Karabakh contributed to a severe economic decline in the
early 1990s. By 1994, however, the Armenian Government launched an
ambitious IMF-sponsored economic liberalization program that
resulted in positive growth rates. Economic growth has averaged over
13% in recent years. Armenia has managed to reduce poverty, slash
inflation, stabilize its currency, and privatize most small- and
medium-sized enterprises. Under the old Soviet central planning
system, Armenia developed a modern industrial sector, supplying
machine tools, textiles, and other manufactured goods to sister
republics, in exchange for raw materials and energy. Armenia has
since switched to small-scale agriculture and away from the large
agroindustrial complexes of the Soviet era. Nuclear power plants
built at Metsamor in the 1970s were closed following the 1988 Spitak
Earthquake, though they sustained no damage. One of the two reactors
was re-opened in 1995, but the Armenian government is under
international pressure to close it due to concerns that the Soviet
era design lacks important safeguards. Metsamor provides 40 percent
of the country's electricity - hydropower accounts for about
one-fourth. Economic ties with Russia remain close, especially in
the energy sector. The electricity distribution system was
privatized in 2002 and bought by Russia's RAO-UES in 2005.
Construction of a pipeline to deliver natural gas from Iran to
Armenia is halfway completed and is scheduled to be commissioned by
January 2009. Armenia has some mineral deposits (copper, gold,
bauxite). Pig iron, unwrought copper, and other nonferrous metals
are Armenia's highest valued exports. Armenia's severe trade
imbalance has been offset somewhat by international aid, remittances
from Armenians working abroad, and foreign direct investment.
Armenia joined the WTO in January 2003. The government made some
improvements in tax and customs administration in recent years, but
anti-corruption measures will be more difficult to implement.
Despite strong economic growth, Armenia's unemployment rate remains
high. Armenia will need to pursue additional economic reforms in
order to improve its economic competitiveness and to build on recent
improvements in poverty and unemployment, especially given its
economic isolation from two of its nearest neighbors, Turkey and
Azerbaijan.

Transnational Issues
Armenia



Disputes - international:

Armenia supports ethnic Armenian secessionists in Nagorno-Karabakh
and since the early 1990s, has militarily occupied 16% of Azerbaijan
- Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
continues to mediate dispute; over 800,000 mostly ethnic
Azerbaijanis were driven from the occupied lands and Armenia; about
230,000 ethnic Armenians were driven from their homes in Azerbaijan
into Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh; Azerbaijan seeks transit route
through Armenia to connect to Naxcivan exclave; border with Turkey
remains closed over Nagorno-Karabakh dispute; ethnic Armenian groups
in Javakheti region of Georgia seek greater autonomy; Armenians
continue to emigrate, primarily to Russia, seeking employment


Refugees and internally displaced persons:

refugees (country of origin): 113,295 (Azerbaijan)
IDPs: 8,400 (conflict with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh,
majority have returned home since 1994 ceasefire) (2007)


Trafficking in persons:

current situation: Armenia is primarily a source country for women
and girls trafficked to the UAE and Turkey for the purpose of
commercial sexual exploitation; Armenian men and women are
trafficked to Turkey and Russia for the purpose of forced labor
tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Armenia is placed on the Tier 2
Watch List for a fourth consecutive year; its efforts to increase
compliance with the minimum standards were assessed based on its
commitments to undertake future actions, particularly in the areas
of improving victim protection and assistance; while the government
elevated anti-trafficking responsibilities to the ministerial level,
adopted a new National Action Plan, and drafted a National Referral
Mechanism, it has yet to show tangible progress in identifying and
protecting victims or in tackling trafficking complicity of
government officials; the Armenian Government made some notable
improvements in its anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts, but it
failed to demonstrate evidence of investigations, prosecutions,
convictions, and sentences of officials complicit in trafficking
(2008)


Illicit drugs:

illicit cultivation of small amount of cannabis for domestic
consumption; minor transit point for illicit drugs - mostly opium
and hashish - moving from Southwest Asia to Russia and to a lesser
extent the rest of Europe

Economy
Aruba



Economy - overview:

Tourism is the mainstay of the small, open Aruban economy, with
offshore banking and oil refining and storage also important. The
rapid growth of the tourism sector over the last decade has resulted
in a substantial expansion of other activities. Over 1.5 million
tourists per year visit Aruba, with 75% of those from the US.
Construction continues to boom, with hotel capacity five times the
1985 level. In addition, the country's oil refinery reopened in
1993, providing a major source of employment, foreign exchange
earnings, and growth. Tourist arrivals have rebounded strongly
following a dip after the 11 September 2001 attacks. The island
experiences only a brief low season, and hotel occupancy in 2004
averaged 80%, compared to 68% throughout the rest of the Caribbean.
The government has made cutting the budget and trade deficits a high
priority.

@Atlantic Ocean

Introduction
Atlantic Ocean



Background:

The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's five oceans
(after the Pacific Ocean, but larger than the Indian Ocean, Southern
Ocean, and Arctic Ocean). The Kiel Canal (Germany), Oresund
(Denmark-Sweden), Bosporus (Turkey), Strait of Gibraltar
(Morocco-Spain), and the Saint Lawrence Seaway (Canada-US) are
important strategic access waterways. The decision by the
International Hydrographic Organization in the spring of 2000 to
delimit a fifth world ocean, the Southern Ocean, removed the portion
of the Atlantic Ocean south of 60 degrees south latitude.

Introduction
Australia



Background:

Aboriginal settlers arrived on the continent from Southeast Asia
about 40,000 years before the first Europeans began exploration in
the 17th century. No formal territorial claims were made until 1770,
when Capt. James COOK took possession in the name of Great Britain.
Six colonies were created in the late 18th and 19th centuries; they
federated and became the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901. The new
country took advantage of its natural resources to rapidly develop
agricultural and manufacturing industries and to make a major
contribution to the British effort in World Wars I and II. In recent
decades, Australia has transformed itself into an internationally
competitive, advanced market economy. It boasted one of the OECD's
fastest growing economies during the 1990s, a performance due in
large part to economic reforms adopted in the 1980s. Long-term
concerns include climate-change issues such as the depletion of the
ozone layer and more frequent droughts, and management and
conservation of coastal areas, especially the Great Barrier Reef.

Economy
Australia



Economy - overview:

Australia has an enviable, strong economy with a per capita GDP on
par with the four dominant West European economies. Robust business
and consumer confidence and high export prices for raw materials and
agricultural products are fueling the economy, particularly in
mining states. Australia's emphasis on reforms, low inflation, a
housing market boom, and growing ties with China have been key
factors behind the economy's 16 solid years of expansion. Drought,
robust import demand, and a strong currency have pushed the trade
deficit up in recent years, while infrastructure bottlenecks and a
tight labor market are constraining growth in export volumes and
stoking inflation. Australia's budget has been in surplus since 2002
due to strong revenue growth.

Introduction
Austria



Background:

Once the center of power for the large Austro-Hungarian Empire,
Austria was reduced to a small republic after its defeat in World
War I. Following annexation by Nazi Germany in 1938 and subsequent
occupation by the victorious Allies in 1945, Austria's status
remained unclear for a decade. A State Treaty signed in 1955 ended
the occupation, recognized Austria's independence, and forbade
unification with Germany. A constitutional law that same year
declared the country's "perpetual neutrality" as a condition for
Soviet military withdrawal. The Soviet Union's collapse in 1991 and
Austria's entry into the European Union in 1995 have altered the
meaning of this neutrality. A prosperous, democratic country,
Austria entered the EU Economic and Monetary Union in 1999.

Economy
Austria



Economy - overview:

Austria, with its well-developed market economy and high standard of
living, is closely tied to other EU economies, especially Germany's.
The Austrian economy also benefits greatly from strong commercial
relations, especially in the banking and insurance sectors, with
central, eastern, and southeastern Europe. The economy features a
large service sector, a sound industrial sector, and a small, but
highly developed agricultural sector. Membership in the EU has drawn
an influx of foreign investors attracted by Austria's access to the
single European market and proximity to the new EU economies. The
outgoing government has successfully pursued a comprehensive
economic reform program, aimed at streamlining government and
creating a more competitive business environment, further
strengthening Austria's attractiveness as an investment location. It
has implemented effective pension reforms; however, lower taxes in
2005-06 led to a small budget deficit in 2006 and 2007. Boosted by
strong exports, growth nevertheless reached 3.3% in both 2006 and
2007, although the economy may slow in 2008 because of the strong
euro, high oil prices, and problems in international financial
markets. To meet increased competition - especially from new EU
members and Central European countries - Austria will need to
continue restructuring, emphasizing knowledge-based sectors of the
economy, and encouraging greater labor flexibility and greater labor
participation by its aging population.

Introduction
Azerbaijan



Background:

Azerbaijan - a nation with a majority-Turkic and majority-Muslim
population - was briefly independent from 1918 to 1920; it regained
its independence after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Despite a 1994 cease-fire, Azerbaijan has yet to resolve its
conflict with Armenia over the Azerbaijani Nagorno-Karabakh enclave
(largely Armenian populated). Azerbaijan has lost 16% of its
territory and must support some 600,000 internally displaced persons
as a result of the conflict. Corruption is ubiquitous, and the
government has been accused of authoritarianism. Although the
poverty rate has been reduced in recent years, the promise of
widespread wealth from development of Azerbaijan's energy sector
remains largely unfulfilled.


Geography
Azerbaijan



Location:

Southwestern Asia, bordering the Caspian Sea, between Iran and
Russia, with a small European portion north of the Caucasus range

local scientists consider the Abseron Yasaqligi (Apsheron Peninsula)
(including Baku and Sumqayit) and the Caspian Sea to be the
ecologically most devastated area in the world because of severe
air, soil, and water pollution; soil pollution results from oil
spills, from the use of DDT pesticide, and from toxic defoliants
used in the production of cotton

Economy
Azerbaijan



Economy - overview:

Azerbaijan's high economic growth in 2006 and 2007 is attributable
to large and growing oil exports. Azerbaijan's oil production
declined through 1997, but has registered an increase every year
since. Negotiation of production-sharing arrangements (PSAs) with
foreign firms, which have committed $60 billion to long-term
oilfield development, should generate the funds needed to spur
future industrial development. Oil production under the first of
these PSAs, with the Azerbaijan International Operating Company,
began in November 1997. A consortium of Western oil companies began
pumping 1 million barrels a day from a large offshore field in early
2006, through a $4 billion pipeline it built from Baku to Turkey's
Mediterranean port of Ceyhan. By 2010 revenues from this project
will double the country's current GDP. Azerbaijan shares all the
formidable problems of the former Soviet republics in making the
transition from a command to a market economy, but its considerable
energy resources brighten its long-term prospects. Baku has only
recently begun making progress on economic reform, and old economic
ties and structures are slowly being replaced. Several other
obstacles impede Azerbaijan's economic progress: the need for
stepped up foreign investment in the non-energy sector, the
continuing conflict with Armenia over the Nagorno-Karabakh region,
pervasive corruption, and elevated inflation. Trade with Russia and
the other former Soviet republics is declining in importance, while
trade is building with Turkey and the nations of Europe. Long-term
prospects will depend on world oil prices, the location of new oil
and gas pipelines in the region, and Azerbaijan's ability to manage
its energy wealth.

Transnational Issues
Azerbaijan



Disputes - international:

Armenia supports ethnic Armenian secessionists in Nagorno-Karabakh
and since the early 1990s has militarily occupied 16% of Azerbaijan;
over 800,000 mostly ethnic Azerbaijanis were driven from the
occupied lands and Armenia; about 230,000 ethnic Armenians were
driven from their homes in Azerbaijan into Armenia and
Nagorno-Karabakh; Azerbaijan seeks transit route through Armenia to
connect to Naxcivan exclave; Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) continues to mediate dispute;
Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Russia have ratified Caspian seabed
delimitation treaties based on equidistance, while Iran continues to
insist on an even one-fifth allocation and challenges Azerbaijan's
hydrocarbon exploration in disputed waters; bilateral talks continue
with Turkmenistan on dividing the seabed and contested oilfields in
the middle of the Caspian; Azerbaijan and Georgia continue to
discuss the alignment of their boundary at certain crossing areas


Refugees and internally displaced persons:

refugees (country of origin): 2,400 (Russia)
IDPs: 580,000-690,000 (conflict with Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh)
(2007)


Trafficking in persons:

current situation: Azerbaijan is primarily a source and transit
country for men, women, and children trafficked for the purposes of
commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor; women and some
children from Azerbaijan are trafficked to Turkey and the UAE for
the purpose of sexual exploitation; men and boys are trafficked to
Russia for the purpose of forced labor; Azerbaijan serves as a
transit country for victims from Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan,
and Moldova trafficked to Turkey and the UAE for sexual exploitation
tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Azerbaijan is on the Tier 2 Watch
List for its failure to provide evidence of increasing efforts to
combat trafficking in persons, particularly efforts to investigate,
prosecute, and punish traffickers; to address complicity among law
enforcement personnel; and to adequately identify and protect
victims in Azerbaijan; the government has yet to develop a
much-needed mechanism to identify potential trafficking victims and
refer them to safety and care; poor treatment of trafficking victims
in courtrooms continues to be a problem (2008)


Illicit drugs:

limited illicit cultivation of cannabis and opium poppy, mostly for
CIS consumption; small government eradication program; transit point
for Southwest Asian opiates bound for Russia and to a lesser extent
the rest of Europe

Lucayan Indians inhabited the islands when Christopher COLUMBUS
first set foot in the New World on San Salvador in 1492. British
settlement of the islands began in 1647; the islands became a colony
in 1783. Since attaining independence from the UK in 1973, The
Bahamas have prospered through tourism and international banking and
investment management. Because of its geography, the country is a
major transshipment point for illegal drugs, particularly shipments
to the US and Europe, and its territory is used for smuggling
illegal migrants into the US.

Economy - overview:

The Bahamas is one of the wealthiest Caribbean countries with an
economy heavily dependent on tourism and offshore banking. Tourism
together with tourism-driven construction and manufacturing accounts
for approximately 60% of GDP and directly or indirectly employs half
of the archipelago's labor force. Steady growth in tourism receipts
and a boom in construction of new hotels, resorts, and residences
had led to solid GDP growth in recent years, but tourist arrivals
have been on the decline since 2006. Financial services constitute
the second-most important sector of the Bahamian economy and, when
combined with business services, account for about 36% of GDP.
However, since December 2000, when the government enacted new
regulations on the financial sector, many international businesses
have left The Bahamas. Manufacturing and agriculture combined
contribute approximately a tenth of GDP and show little growth,
despite government incentives aimed at those sectors. Overall growth
prospects in the short run rest heavily on the fortunes of the
tourism sector. Tourism, in turn, depends on growth in the US, the
source of more than 80% of the visitors.

Introduction
Bahrain



Background:

In 1783, the al-Khalifa family captured Bahrain from the Persians.
In order to secure these holdings, it entered into a series of
treaties with the UK during the 19th century that made Bahrain a
British protectorate. The archipelago attained its independence in
1971. Bahrain's small size and central location among Persian Gulf
countries require it to play a delicate balancing act in foreign
affairs among its larger neighbors. Facing declining oil reserves,
Bahrain has turned to petroleum processing and refining and has
transformed itself into an international banking center. King HAMAD
bin Isa al-Khalifa, after coming to power in 1999, pushed economic
and political reforms to improve relations with the Shia community.
Shia political societies participated in 2006 parliamentary and
municipal elections. Al Wifaq, the largest Shia political society,
won the largest number of seats in the elected chamber of the
legislature. However, Shi'a discontent has resurfaced in recent
years with street demonstrations and occasional low-level violence.

Economy
Bahrain



Economy - overview:

With its highly developed communication and transport facilities,
Bahrain is home to numerous multinational firms with business in the
Gulf. Petroleum production and refining account for over 60% of
Bahrain's export receipts, over 70% of government revenues, and 11%
of GDP (exclusive of allied industries), underpinning Bahrain's
strong economic growth in recent years. Aluminum is Bahrain's second
major export after oil. Other major segments of Bahrain's economy
are the financial and construction sectors. Bahrain is focused on
Islamic banking and is competing on an international scale with
Malaysia as a worldwide banking center. Bahrain is actively pursuing
the diversification and privatization of its economy to reduce the
country's dependence on oil. As part of this effort, in August 2006
Bahrain and the US implemented a Free Trade Agreement (FTA), the
first FTA between the US and a Gulf state. Continued strong growth
hinges on Bahrain's ability to acquire new natural gas supplies as
feedstock to support its expanding petrochemical and aluminum
industries. Unemployment, especially among the young, and the
depletion of oil and underground water resources are long-term
economic problems.

none


Trafficking in persons:

current situation: Bahrain is a destination country for men and
women trafficked for the purposes of involuntary servitude and
commercial sexual exploitation; men and women from Africa, South
Asia, and Southeast Asia migrate voluntarily to Bahrain to work as
laborers or domestic servants where some face conditions of
involuntary servitude such as unlawful withholding of passports,
restrictions on movements, non-payment of wages, threats, and
physical or sexual abuse; women from Thailand, Morocco, Eastern
Europe, and Central Asia are trafficked to Bahrain for the purpose
of commercial sexual exploitation
tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Bahrain is on the Tier 2 Watch List
for failing to show evidence of increased efforts to combat human
trafficking, particularly efforts that enforce laws against
trafficking in persons, and that prevent the punishment of victims
of trafficking; during 2007, Bahrain passed a comprehensive law
prohibiting all forms of trafficking in persons; the government also
established a specialized anti-trafficking unit within the Ministry
of Interior to investigate trafficking crimes; however, the
government did not report any prosecutions or convictions for
trafficking offenses during 2007, despite reports of a substantial
problem of involuntary servitude and sex trafficking (2008)

Introduction
Bangladesh



Background:

Europeans began to set up trading posts in the area of Bangladesh in
the 16th century; eventually the British came to dominate the region
and it became part of British India. In 1947, West Pakistan and East
Bengal (both primarily Muslim) separated from India (largely Hindu)
and jointly became the new country of Pakistan. East Bengal became
East Pakistan in 1955, but the awkward arrangement of a two-part
country with its territorial units separated by 1,600 km left the
Bengalis marginalized and dissatisfied. East Pakistan seceded from
its union with West Pakistan in 1971 and was renamed Bangladesh. A
military-backed caretaker regime suspended planned parliamentary
elections in January 2007 in an effort to reform the political
system and root out corruption; the regime has pledged new
democratic elections by the end of 2008. About a third of this
extremely poor country floods annually during the monsoon rainy
season, hampering economic development.

Economy
Bangladesh



Economy - overview:

The economy has grown 5-6% over the past few years despite
inefficient state-owned enterprises, delays in exploiting natural
gas resources, insufficient power supplies, and slow implementation
of economic reforms. Bangladesh remains a poor, overpopulated, and
inefficiently-governed nation. Although more than half of GDP is
generated through the service sector, nearly two-thirds of
Bangladeshis are employed in the agriculture sector, with rice as
the single-most-important product. Garment exports and remittances
from Bangladeshis working overseas, mainly in the Middle East and
East Asia, fuel economic growth.

Introduction
Barbados



Background:

The island was uninhabited when first settled by the British in
1627. Slaves worked the sugar plantations established on the island
until 1834 when slavery was abolished. The economy remained heavily
dependent on sugar, rum, and molasses production through most of the
20th century. The gradual introduction of social and political
reforms in the 1940s and 1950s led to complete independence from the
UK in 1966. In the 1990s, tourism and manufacturing surpassed the
sugar industry in economic importance.

Economy
Barbados



Economy - overview:

Historically, the Barbadian economy was dependent on sugarcane
cultivation and related activities. However, production in recent
years has diversified into light industry and tourism, with about
three-quarters of GDP and 80% of exports being attributed to
services. Growth has rebounded since 2003, bolstered by increases in
construction projects and tourism revenues - reflecting its success
in the higher-end segment. The country enjoys one of the highest per
capita incomes in the region and an investment grade rating which
benefits from its political stability and stable institutions.
Offshore finance and information services are important foreign
exchange earners and thrive from having the same time zone as
eastern US financial centers and a relatively highly educated
workforce. The government continues its efforts to reduce
unemployment, to encourage direct foreign investment, and to
privatize remaining state-owned enterprises.

Introduction
Belarus



Background:

After seven decades as a constituent republic of the USSR, Belarus
attained its independence in 1991. It has retained closer political
and economic ties to Russia than any of the other former Soviet
republics. Belarus and Russia signed a treaty on a two-state union
on 8 December 1999 envisioning greater political and economic
integration. Although Belarus agreed to a framework to carry out the
accord, serious implementation has yet to take place. Since his
election in July 1994 as the country's first president, Alexandr
LUKASHENKO has steadily consolidated his power through authoritarian
means. Government restrictions on freedom of speech and the press,
peaceful assembly, and religion continue.

Economy
Belarus



Economy - overview:

Belarus has seen little structural reform since 1995, when President
LUKASHENKO launched the country on the path of "market socialism."
In keeping with this policy, LUKASHENKO reimposed administrative
controls over prices and currency exchange rates and expanded the
state's right to intervene in the management of private enterprises.
Since 2005, the government has re-nationalized a number of private
companies. In addition, businesses have been subject to pressure by
central and local governments, e.g., arbitrary changes in
regulations, numerous rigorous inspections, retroactive application
of new business regulations, and arrests of "disruptive" businessmen
and factory owners. A wide range of redistributive policies has
helped those at the bottom of the ladder; the Gini coefficient is
among the lowest in the world. Because of these restrictive economic
policies, Belarus has had trouble attracting foreign investment.
Nevertheless, GDP growth has been strong in recent years, reaching
nearly 7% in 2007, despite the roadblocks of a tough, centrally
directed economy with a high, but decreasing, rate of inflation.
Belarus receives heavily discounted oil and natural gas from Russia
and much of Belarus' growth can be attributed to the re-export of
Russian oil at market prices. Trade with Russia - by far its largest
single trade partner - decreased in 2007, largely as a result of a
change in the way the Value Added Tax (VAT) on trade was collected.
Russia has introduced an export duty on oil shipped to Belarus,
which will increase gradually through 2009, and a requirement that
Belarusian duties on re-exported Russian oil be shared with Russia -
80% will go to Russia in 2008, and 85% in 2009. Russia also
increased Belarusian natural gas prices from $47 per thousand cubic
meters (tcm) to $100 per tcm in 2007, and plans to increase prices
gradually to world levels by 2011. Russia's recent policy of
bringing energy prices for Belarus to world market levels may result
in a slowdown in economic growth in Belarus over the next few years.
Some policy measures, including tightening of fiscal and monetary
policies, improving energy efficiency, and diversifying exports,
have been introduced, but external borrowing has been the main
mechanism used to manage the growing pressures on the economy.

Introduction
Belgium



Background:

Belgium became independent from the Netherlands in 1830; it was
occupied by Germany during World Wars I and II. The country
prospered in the past half century as a modern, technologically
advanced European state and member of NATO and the EU. Tensions
between the Dutch-speaking Flemings of the north and the
French-speaking Walloons of the south have led in recent years to
constitutional amendments granting these regions formal recognition
and autonomy.

Economy
Belgium



Economy - overview:

This modern, private-enterprise economy has capitalized on its
central geographic location, highly developed transport network, and
diversified industrial and commercial base. Industry is concentrated
mainly in the populous Flemish area in the north. With few natural
resources, Belgium must import substantial quantities of raw
materials and export a large volume of manufactures, making its
economy unusually dependent on the state of world markets. Roughly
three-quarters of its trade is with other EU countries. Public debt
is more than 85% of GDP. On the positive side, the government has
succeeded in balancing its budget, and income distribution is
relatively equal. Belgium began circulating the euro currency in
January 2002. Economic growth in 2001-03 dropped sharply because of
the global economic slowdown, with moderate recovery in 2004-07.
Economic growth and foreign direct investment are expected to slow
down in 2008, due to credit tightening, falling consumer and
business confidence, and above average inflation. However, with the
successful negotiation of the 2008 budget and devolution of power
within the government, political tensions seem to be easing and
could lead to an improvement in the economic outlook for 2008.

Introduction
Belize



Background:

Belize was the site of several Mayan city states until their decline
at the end of the first millennium A.D. The British and Spanish
disputed the region in the 17th and 18th centuries; it formally
became the colony of British Honduras in 1854. Territorial disputes
between the UK and Guatemala delayed the independence of Belize
until 1981. Guatemala refused to recognize the new nation until
1992. Tourism has become the mainstay of the economy. Current
concerns include an unsustainable foreign debt, high unemployment,
growing involvement in the South American drug trade, growing urban
crime, and increasing incidences of HIV/AIDS.

Economy
Belize



Economy - overview:

In this small, essentially private-enterprise economy, tourism is
the number one foreign exchange earner followed by exports of marine
products, citrus, cane sugar, bananas, and garments. The
government's expansionary monetary and fiscal policies, initiated in
September 1998, led to sturdy GDP growth averaging nearly 4% in
1999-2007. Oil discoveries in 2006 bolstered the economic growth in
2006 and 2007. Major concerns continue to be the sizable trade
deficit and unsustainable foreign debt. In February 2007, the
government restructured nearly all of its public external commercial
debt, which will reduce interest payments and relieve liquidity
concerns. A key short-term objective remains the reduction of
poverty with the help of international donors.

Introduction
Benin



Background:

Present day Benin was the site of Dahomey, a prominent West African
kingdom that rose in the 15th century. The territory became a French
Colony in 1872 and achieved independence on 1 August 1960, as the
Republic of Benin. A succession of military governments ended in
1972 with the rise to power of Mathieu KEREKOU and the establishment
of a government based on Marxist-Leninist principles. A move to
representative government began in 1989. Two years later, free
elections ushered in former Prime Minister Nicephore SOGLO as
president, marking the first successful transfer of power in Africa
from a dictatorship to a democracy. KEREKOU was returned to power by
elections held in 1996 and 2001, though some irregularities were
alleged. KEREKOU stepped down at the end of his second term in 2006
and was succeeded by Thomas YAYI Boni, a political outsider and
independent. YAYI has begun a high profile fight against corruption
and has strongly promoted accelerating Benin's economic growth.

Economy
Benin



Economy - overview:

The economy of Benin remains underdeveloped and dependent on
subsistence agriculture, cotton production, and regional trade.
Growth in real output has averaged around 5% in the past seven
years, but rapid population growth has offset much of this increase.
Inflation has subsided over the past several years. In order to
raise growth still further, Benin plans to attract more foreign
investment, place more emphasis on tourism, facilitate the
development of new food processing systems and agricultural
products, and encourage new information and communication
technology. Specific projects to improve the business climate by
reforms to the land tenure system, the commercial justice system,
and the financial sector were included in Benin's $307 million
Millennium Challenge Account grant signed in February 2006. The 2001
privatization policy continues in telecommunications, water,
electricity, and agriculture though the government annulled the
privatization of Benin's state cotton company in November 2007 after
the discovery of irregularities in the bidding process. The Paris
Club and bilateral creditors have eased the external debt situation,
with Benin benefiting from a G8 debt reduction announced in July
2005, while pressing for more rapid structural reforms. An
insufficient electrical supply continues to adversely affect Benin's
economic growth though the government recently has taken steps to
increase domestic power production.

Introduction
Bermuda



Background:

Bermuda was first settled in 1609 by shipwrecked English colonists
headed for Virginia. Tourism to the island to escape North American
winters first developed in Victorian times. Tourism continues to be
important to the island's economy, although international business
has overtaken it in recent years. Bermuda has developed into a
highly successful offshore financial center. Although a referendum
on independence from the UK was soundly defeated in 1995, the
present government has reopened debate on the issue.

Economy
Bermuda



Economy - overview:

Bermuda enjoys the third highest per capita income in the world,
more than 50% higher than that of the US. Its economy is primarily
based on providing financial services for international business and
luxury facilities for tourists. A number of reinsurance companies
relocated to the island following the 11 September 2001 attacks and
again after Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, contributing to the
expansion of an already robust international business sector.
Bermuda's tourism industry - which derives over 80% of its visitors
from the US - continues to struggle but remains the island's number
two industry. Most capital equipment and food must be imported.
Bermuda's industrial sector is small, although construction
continues to be important; the average cost of a house in June 2003
had risen to $976,000. Agriculture is limited with only 20% of the
land being arable.

@Bhutan

Introduction
Bhutan



Background:

In 1865, Britain and Bhutan signed the Treaty of Sinchulu, under
which Bhutan would receive an annual subsidy in exchange for ceding
some border land to British India. Under British influence, a
monarchy was set up in 1907; three years later, a treaty was signed
whereby the British agreed not to interfere in Bhutanese internal
affairs and Bhutan allowed Britain to direct its foreign affairs.
This role was assumed by independent India after 1947. Two years
later, a formal Indo-Bhutanese accord returned the areas of Bhutan
annexed by the British, formalized the annual subsidies the country
received, and defined India's responsibilities in defense and
foreign relations. A refugee issue of over 100,000 Bhutanese in
Nepal remains unresolved; 90% of the refugees are housed in seven
United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
camps. In March 2005, King Jigme Singye WANGCHUCK unveiled the
government's draft constitution - which would introduce major
democratic reforms - and pledged to hold a national referendum for
its approval. In December 2006, the King abdicated the throne to his
son, Jigme Khesar Namgyel WANGCHUCK, in order to give him experience
as head of state before the democratic transition. In early 2007,
India and Bhutan renegotiated their treaty to allow Bhutan greater
autonomy in conducting its foreign policy, although Thimphu
continues to coordinate policy decisions in this area with New
Delhi. In July 2007, seven ministers of Bhutan's ten-member cabinet
resigned to join the political process, and the cabinet acted as a
caretaker regime until democratic elections for seats to the
country's first parliament were completed in March 2008. The king
ratified the country's first constitution in July 2008.

Economy
Bhutan



Economy - overview:

The economy, one of the world's smallest and least developed, is
based on agriculture and forestry, which provide the main livelihood
for more than 60% of the population. Agriculture consists largely of
subsistence farming and animal husbandry. Rugged mountains dominate
the terrain and make the building of roads and other infrastructure
difficult and expensive. The economy is closely aligned with India's
through strong trade and monetary links and dependence on India's
financial assistance. The industrial sector is technologically
backward, with most production of the cottage industry type. Most
development projects, such as road construction, rely on Indian
migrant labor. Model education, social, and environment programs are
underway with support from multilateral development organizations.
Each economic program takes into account the government's desire to
protect the country's environment and cultural traditions. For
example, the government, in its cautious expansion of the tourist
sector, encourages visits by upscale, environmentally conscientious
tourists. Detailed controls and uncertain policies in areas such as
industrial licensing, trade, labor, and finance continue to hamper
foreign investment. Hydropower exports to India had a major impact
on growth in 2007.

Introduction
Bolivia



Background:

Bolivia, named after independence fighter Simon BOLIVAR, broke away
from Spanish rule in 1825; much of its subsequent history has
consisted of a series of nearly 200 coups and countercoups.
Democratic civilian rule was established in 1982, but leaders have
faced difficult problems of deep-seated poverty, social unrest, and
illegal drug production. In December 2005, Bolivians elected
Movement Toward Socialism leader Evo MORALES president - by the
widest margin of any leader since the restoration of civilian rule
in 1982 - after he ran on a promise to change the country's
traditional political class and empower the nation's poor majority.
However, since taking office, his controversial strategies have
exacerbated racial and economic tensions between the Amerindian
populations of the Andean west and the non-indigenous communities of
the eastern lowlands.

Economy
Bolivia



Economy - overview:

Bolivia is one of the poorest and least developed countries in Latin
America. Following a disastrous economic crisis during the early
1980s, reforms spurred private investment, stimulated economic
growth, and cut poverty rates in the 1990s. The period 2003-05 was
characterized by political instability, racial tensions, and violent
protests against plans - subsequently abandoned - to export
Bolivia's newly discovered natural gas reserves to large northern
hemisphere markets. In 2005, the government passed a controversial
hydrocarbons law that imposed significantly higher royalties and
required foreign firms then operating under risk-sharing contracts
to surrender all production to the state energy company, which was
made the sole exporter of natural gas. The law also required that
the state energy company regain control over the five companies that
were privatized during the 1990s - a process that is still underway.
In 2006, higher earnings for mining and hydrocarbons exports pushed
the current account surplus to about 12% of GDP and the government's
higher tax take produced a fiscal surplus after years of large
deficits. Debt relief from the G8 - announced in 2005 - also has
significantly reduced Bolivia's public sector debt burden. Private
investment as a share of GDP, however, remains among the lowest in
Latin America, and inflation reached double-digit levels in 2007.

@Bosnia and Herzegovina

Introduction
Bosnia and Herzegovina



Background:

Bosnia and Herzegovina's declaration of sovereignty in October 1991
was followed by a declaration of independence from the former
Yugoslavia on 3 March 1992 after a referendum boycotted by ethnic
Serbs. The Bosnian Serbs - supported by neighboring Serbia and
Montenegro - responded with armed resistance aimed at partitioning
the republic along ethnic lines and joining Serb-held areas to form
a "Greater Serbia." In March 1994, Bosniaks and Croats reduced the
number of warring factions from three to two by signing an agreement
creating a joint Bosniak/Croat Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
On 21 November 1995, in Dayton, Ohio, the warring parties initialed
a peace agreement that brought to a halt three years of interethnic
civil strife (the final agreement was signed in Paris on 14 December
1995). The Dayton Peace Accords retained Bosnia and Herzegovina's
international boundaries and created a joint multi-ethnic and
democratic government charged with conducting foreign, diplomatic,
and fiscal policy. Also recognized was a second tier of government
comprised of two entities roughly equal in size: the Bosniak/Croat
Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Bosnian Serb-led
Republika Srpska (RS). The Federation and RS governments were
charged with overseeing most government functions. The Office of the
High Representative (OHR) was established to oversee the
implementation of the civilian aspects of the agreement. In 1995-96,
a NATO-led international peacekeeping force (IFOR) of 60,000 troops
served in Bosnia to implement and monitor the military aspects of
the agreement. IFOR was succeeded by a smaller, NATO-led
Stabilization Force (SFOR) whose mission was to deter renewed
hostilities. European Union peacekeeping troops (EUFOR) replaced
SFOR in December 2004; their mission is to maintain peace and
stability throughout the country. EUFOR's mission changed from
peacekeeping to civil policing in October 2007, with its presence
reduced from nearly 7,000 to 2,500 troops.

Economy
Bosnia and Herzegovina



Economy - overview:

Bosnia and Herzegovina ranked next to Macedonia as the poorest
republic in the old Yugoslav federation. Although agriculture is
almost all in private hands, farms are small and inefficient, and
the republic traditionally is a net importer of food. The private
sector is growing and foreign investment is slowly increasing, but
government spending, at nearly 40% of adjusted GDP, remains
unreasonably high. The interethnic warfare in Bosnia caused
production to plummet by 80% from 1992 to 1995 and unemployment to
soar. With an uneasy peace in place, output recovered in 1996-99 at
high percentage rates from a low base; but output growth slowed in
2000-02. Part of the lag in output was made up in 2003-07 when GDP
growth exceeded 5% per year. National-level statistics are limited
and do not capture the large share of black market activity. The
konvertibilna marka (convertible mark or BAM)- the national currency
introduced in 1998 - is pegged to the euro, and confidence in the
currency and the banking sector has increased. Implementing
privatization, however, has been slow, particularly in the
Federation, although more successful in the Republika Srpska.
Banking reform accelerated in 2001 as all the Communist-era payments
bureaus were shut down; foreign banks, primarily from Western
Europe, now control most of the banking sector. A sizeable current
account deficit and high unemployment rate remain the two most
serious macroeconomic problems. On 1 January 2006 a new value-added
tax (VAT) went into effect. The VAT has been successful in capturing
much of the gray market economy and has developed into a significant
and predictable source of revenues for all layers of government.
Bosnia and Herzegovina became a full member of the Central European
Free Trade Agreement in September 2007. The country receives
substantial reconstruction assistance and humanitarian aid from the
international community but will have to prepare for an era of
declining assistance.

Introduction
Botswana



Background:

Formerly the British protectorate of Bechuanaland, Botswana adopted
its new name upon independence in 1966. Four decades of
uninterrupted civilian leadership, progressive social policies, and
significant capital investment have created one of the most dynamic
economies in Africa. Mineral extraction, principally diamond mining,
dominates economic activity, though tourism is a growing sector due
to the country's conservation practices and extensive nature
preserves. Botswana has one of the world's highest known rates of
HIV/AIDS infection, but also one of Africa's most progressive and
comprehensive programs for dealing with the disease.

the world to a middle-income country with a per capita GDP of nearly
$15,000 in 2007. Two major investment services rank Botswana as the
best credit risk in Africa. Diamond mining has fueled much of the
expansion and currently accounts for more than one-third of GDP and
for 70-80% of export earnings. Tourism, financial services,
subsistence farming, and cattle raising are other key sectors. On
the downside, the government must deal with high rates of
unemployment and poverty. Unemployment officially was 23.8% in 2004,
but unofficial estimates place it closer to 40%. HIV/AIDS infection
rates are the second highest in the world and threaten Botswana's
impressive economic gains. An expected leveling off in diamond
mining production overshadows long-term prospects.

@Bouvet Island

Introduction
Bouvet Island



Background:

This uninhabited volcanic island is almost entirely covered by
glaciers and is difficult to approach. It was discovered in 1739 by
a French naval officer after whom the island was named. No claim was
made until 1825, when the British flag was raised. In 1928, the UK
waived its claim in favor of Norway, which had occupied the island
the previous year. In 1971, Norway designated Bouvet Island and the
adjacent territorial waters a nature reserve. Since 1977, it has run
an automated meteorological station on the island.

@Brazil

Introduction
Brazil



Background:

Following three centuries under the rule of Portugal, Brazil became
an independent nation in 1822 and a republic in 1889. By far the
largest and most populous country in South America, Brazil overcame
more than half a century of military intervention in the governance
of the country when in 1985 the military regime peacefully ceded
power to civilian rulers. Brazil continues to pursue industrial and
agricultural growth and development of its interior. Exploiting vast
natural resources and a large labor pool, it is today South
America's leading economic power and a regional leader. Highly
unequal income distribution and crime remain pressing problems.

Economy
Brazil



Economy - overview:

Characterized by large and well-developed agricultural, mining,
manufacturing, and service sectors, Brazil's economy outweighs that
of all other South American countries and is expanding its presence
in world markets. Having weathered 2001-03 financial turmoil,
capital inflows are regaining strength and the currency has resumed
appreciating. The appreciation has slowed export volume growth, but
since 2004, Brazil's growth has yielded increases in employment and
real wages. The resilience in the economy stems from
commodity-driven current account surpluses, and sound macroeconomic
policies that have bolstered international reserves to historically
high levels, reduced public debt, and allowed a significant decline
in real interest rates. A floating exchange rate, an
inflation-targeting regime, and a tight fiscal policy are the three
pillars of the economic program. From 2003 to 2007, Brazil ran
record trade surpluses and recorded its first current account
surpluses since 1992. Productivity gains coupled with high commodity
prices contributed to the surge in exports. Brazil improved its debt
profile in 2006 by shifting its debt burden toward real denominated
and domestically held instruments. "LULA" DA SILVA restated his
commitment to fiscal responsibility by maintaining the country's
primary surplus during the 2006 election. Following his second
inauguration, "LULA" DA SILVA announced a package of further
economic reforms to reduce taxes and increase investment in
infrastructure. The government's goal of achieving strong growth
while reducing the debt burden is likely to create inflationary
pressures.

@British Indian Ocean Territory

Introduction
British Indian Ocean Territory



Background:

Formerly administered as part of the British Crown Colony of
Mauritius, the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) was established
as an overseas territory of the UK in 1965. A number of the islands
of the territory were later transferred to the Seychelles when it
attained independence in 1976. Subsequently, BIOT has consisted only
of the six main island groups comprising the Chagos Archipelago. The
largest and most southerly of the islands, Diego Garcia, contains a
joint UK-US naval support facility. All of the remaining islands are
uninhabited. Between 1967 and 1973, former agricultural workers,
earlier residents in the islands, were relocated primarily to
Mauritius, but also to the Seychelles. Negotiations between 1971 and
1982 resulted in the establishment of a trust fund by the British
Government as compensation for the displaced islanders, known as
Chagossians. Beginning in 1998, the islanders pursued a series of
lawsuits against the British Government seeking further compensation
and the right to return to the territory. In 2006 and 2007, British
court rulings invalidated the immigration policies contained in the
2004 BIOT Constitution Order that had excluded the islanders from
the archipelago, but upheld the special military status of Diego
Garcia. In 2008, the House of Lords, as the final court of appeal in
the UK, ruled in favor of the British Goverment by overturning the
lower court rulings and finding no right of return on the part of
the Chagossians.

Economy
British Virgin Islands



Economy - overview:

The economy, one of the most stable and prosperous in the Caribbean,
is highly dependent on tourism, generating an estimated 45% of the
national income. An estimated 820,000 tourists, mainly from the US,
visited the islands in 2005. In the mid-1980s, the government began
offering offshore registration to companies wishing to incorporate
in the islands, and incorporation fees now generate substantial
revenues. Roughly 400,000 companies were on the offshore registry by
yearend 2000. The adoption of a comprehensive insurance law in late
1994, which provides a blanket of confidentiality with regulated
statutory gateways for investigation of criminal offenses, made the
British Virgin Islands even more attractive to international
business. Livestock raising is the most important agricultural
activity; poor soils limit the islands' ability to meet domestic
food requirements. Because of traditionally close links with the US
Virgin Islands, the British Virgin Islands has used the US dollar as
its currency since 1959.

Introduction
Brunei



Background:

The Sultanate of Brunei's influence peaked between the 15th and 17th
centuries when its control extended over coastal areas of northwest
Borneo and the southern Philippines. Brunei subsequently entered a
period of decline brought on by internal strife over royal
succession, colonial expansion of European powers, and piracy. In
1888, Brunei became a British protectorate; independence was
achieved in 1984. The same family has ruled Brunei for over six
centuries. Brunei benefits from extensive petroleum and natural gas
fields, the source of one of the highest per capita GDPs in Asia.

Economy
Brunei



Economy - overview:

Brunei has a small well-to-do economy that encompasses a mixture of
foreign and domestic entrepreneurship, government regulation,
welfare measures, and village tradition. Crude oil and natural gas
production account for just over half of GDP and more than 90% of
exports. Per capita GDP is among the highest in Asia, and
substantial income from overseas investment supplements income from
domestic production. The government provides for all medical
services and free education through the university level and
subsidizes rice and housing. Brunei's leaders are concerned that
steadily increased integration in the world economy will undermine
internal social cohesion. Plans for the future include upgrading the
labor force, reducing unemployment, strengthening the banking and
tourist sectors, and, in general, further widening the economic base
beyond oil and gas.

conduct" desired by several of the disputants

@Bulgaria

Introduction
Bulgaria



Background:

The Bulgars, a Central Asian Turkic tribe, merged with the local
Slavic inhabitants in the late 7th century to form the first
Bulgarian state. In succeeding centuries, Bulgaria struggled with
the Byzantine Empire to assert its place in the Balkans, but by the
end of the 14th century the country was overrun by the Ottoman
Turks. Northern Bulgaria attained autonomy in 1878 and all of
Bulgaria became independent from the Ottoman Empire in 1908. Having
fought on the losing side in both World Wars, Bulgaria fell within
the Soviet sphere of influence and became a People's Republic in
1946. Communist domination ended in 1990, when Bulgaria held its
first multiparty election since World War II and began the
contentious process of moving toward political democracy and a
market economy while combating inflation, unemployment, corruption,
and crime. The country joined NATO in 2004 and the EU in 2007.

Economy
Bulgaria



Economy - overview:

Bulgaria, a former communist country that entered the EU on 1
January 2007, has experienced strong growth since a major economic
downturn in 1996. Successive governments have demonstrated
commitment to economic reforms and responsible fiscal planning, but
have failed so far to rein in rising inflation and large current
account deficits. Bulgaria has averaged more than 6% growth since
2004, attracting significant amounts of foreign direct investment,
but corruption in the public administration, a weak judiciary, and
the presence of organized crime remain significant challenges.

Telephone system:

general assessment: an extensive but antiquated telecommunications
network inherited from the Soviet era; quality has improved; the
Bulgaria Telecommunications Company's fixed-line monopoly terminated
in 2005 when alternative fixed-line operators were given access to
its network; a drop in fixed-line connections in recent years has
been more than offset by a sharp increase in mobile-cellular
telephone use fostered by multiple service providers; the number of
cellular telephone subscriptions now exceeds the population
domestic: a fairly modern digital cable trunk line now connects
switching centers in most of the regions; the others are connected
by digital microwave radio relay
international: country code - 359; submarine cable provides
connectivity to Ukraine and Russia; a combination submarine cable
and land fiber-optic system provides connectivity to Italy, Albania,
and Macedonia; satellite earth stations - 3 (1 Intersputnik in the
Atlantic Ocean region, 2 Intelsat in the Atlantic and Indian Ocean
regions) (2007)

Introduction
Burkina Faso



Background:

Burkina Faso (formerly Upper Volta) achieved independence from
France in 1960. Repeated military coups during the 1970s and 1980s
were followed by multiparty elections in the early 1990s. Current
President Blaise COMPAORE came to power in a 1987 military coup and
has won every election since then. Burkina Faso's high population
density and limited natural resources result in poor economic
prospects for the majority of its citizens. Recent unrest in Cote
d'Ivoire and northern Ghana has hindered the ability of several
hundred thousand seasonal Burkinabe farm workers to find employment
in neighboring countries.

Economy
Burkina Faso



Economy - overview:

One of the poorest countries in the world, landlocked Burkina Faso
has few natural resources and a weak industrial base. About 90% of
the population is engaged in subsistence agriculture, which is
vulnerable to periodic drought. Cotton is the main cash crop and the
government has joined with three other cotton producing countries in
the region - Mali, Niger, and Chad - to lobby in the World Trade
Organization for fewer subsidies to producers in other competing
countries. Since 1998, Burkina Faso has embarked upon a gradual but
successful privatization of state-owned enterprises. Having revised
its investment code in 2004, Burkina Faso hopes to attract foreign
investors. Thanks to this new code and other legislation favoring
the mining sector, the country has seen an upswing in gold
exploration and production. While the bitter internal crisis in
neighboring Cote d'Ivoire is beginning to be resolved, it is still
having a negative effect on Burkina Faso's trade and employment. In
2007 higher costs for energy and imported foodstuffs, as well as low
cotton prices, dampened a GDP growth rate that had averaged 6% in
the last 10 years. Burkina Faso received a Millennium Challenge
Account threshold grant to improve girls' education at the primary
school level, and appears likely to receive a grant in the areas of
infrastructure, agriculture, and land reform.

Introduction
Burma



Background:

Britain conquered Burma over a period of 62 years (1824-1886) and
incorporated it into its Indian Empire. Burma was administered as a
province of India until 1937 when it became a separate,
self-governing colony; independence from the Commonwealth was
attained in 1948. Gen. NE WIN dominated the government from 1962 to
1988, first as military ruler, then as self-appointed president, and
later as political kingpin. Despite multiparty legislative elections
in 1990 that resulted in the main opposition party - the National
League for Democracy (NLD) - winning a landslide victory, the ruling
junta refused to hand over power. NLD leader and Nobel Peace Prize
recipient AUNG SAN SUU KYI, who was under house arrest from 1989 to
1995 and 2000 to 2002, was imprisoned in May 2003 and subsequently
transferred to house arrest. After Burma's ruling junta in August
2007 unexpectedly increased fuel prices, tens of thousands of
Burmese marched in protest, led by prodemocracy activists and
Buddhist monks. In late September 2007, the government brutally
suppressed the protests, killing at least 13 people and arresting
thousands for participating in the demonstrations. Since then, the
regime has continued to raid homes and monasteries and arrest
persons suspected of participating in the pro-democracy protests.
The junta appointed Labor Minister AUNG KYI in October 2007 as
liaison to AUNG SAN SUU KYI, who remains under house arrest and
virtually incommunicado with her party and supporters.

Economy
Burma



Economy - overview:

Burma, a resource-rich country, suffers from pervasive government
controls, inefficient economic policies, and rural poverty. The
junta took steps in the early 1990s to liberalize the economy after
decades of failure under the "Burmese Way to Socialism," but those
efforts stalled, and some of the liberalization measures were
rescinded. Despite Burma's increasing oil and gas revenue,
socio-economic conditions have deteriorated due to the regime's
mismanagement of the economy. Lacking monetary or fiscal stability,
the economy suffers from serious macroeconomic imbalances -
including rising inflation, fiscal deficits, multiple official
exchange rates that overvalue the Burmese kyat, a distorted interest
rate regime, unreliable statistics, and an inability to reconcile
national accounts to determine a realistic GDP figure. Most overseas
development assistance ceased after the junta began to suppress the
democracy movement in 1988 and subsequently refused to honor the
results of the 1990 legislative elections. In response to the
government of Burma's attack in May 2003 on AUNG SAN SUU KYI and her
convoy, the US imposed new economic sanctions in August 2003
including a ban on imports of Burmese products and a ban on
provision of financial services by US persons. Further, a poor
investment climate hampers attracting outside investment slowing the
inflow of foreign exchange. The most productive sectors will
continue to be in extractive industries, especially oil and gas,
mining, and timber with the latter especially causing environmental
degradation. Other areas, such as manufacturing and services, are
struggling with inadequate infrastructure, unpredictable
import/export policies, deteriorating health and education systems,
and endemic corruption. A major banking crisis in 2003 shuttered the
country's 20 private banks and disrupted the economy. As of 2007,
the largest private banks operated under tight restrictions limiting
the private sector's access to formal credit. Moreover, the
September 2007 crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators, including
thousands of monks, further strained the economy as the tourism
industry, which directly employs about 500,000 people, suffered
dramatic declines in foreign visitor levels. In November 2007, the
European Union announced new sanctions banning investment and trade
in Burmese gems, timber and precious stones, while the United States
expanded its sanctions list to include more Burmese government and
military officials and their family members, as well as prominent
regime business cronies, their family members, and associated
companies. Official statistics are inaccurate. Published statistics
on foreign trade are greatly understated because of the size of the
black market and unofficial border trade - often estimated to be as
large as the official economy. Though the Burmese government has
good economic relations with its neighbors, better investment and
business climates and an improved political situation are needed to
promote serious foreign investment, exports, and tourism.

Transnational Issues
Burma



Disputes - international:

over half of Burma's population consists of diverse ethnic groups
who have substantial numbers of kin in neighboring countries;
Thailand must deal with Karen and other ethnic refugees, asylum
seekers, and rebels, as well as illegal cross-border activities from
Burma; Thailand is studying the feasibility of jointly constructing
the Hatgyi Dam on the Salween River near the border with Burma;
citing environmental, cultural, and social concerns, China is
reconsidering construction of 13 dams on the Salween River but
energy-starved Burma with backing from Thailand remains intent on
building five hydro-electric dams downstream, despite identical
regional and international protests; India seeks cooperation from
Burma to keep Indian Nagaland separatists, such as the United
Liberation Front of Assam, from hiding in remote Burmese Uplands;
after 21 years, Bangladesh resumes talks with Burma on delimiting a
maritime boundary in January 2008


Refugees and internally displaced persons:

IDPs: 503,000 (government offensives against ethnic insurgent groups
near the eastern borders; most IDPs are ethnic Karen, Karenni, Shan,
Tavoyan, and Mon) (2007)


Trafficking in persons:

current situation: Burma is a source country for women, children,
and men trafficked for the purpose of forced labor and commercial
sexual exploitation; Burmese women and children are trafficked to
East and Southeast Asia for commercial sexual exploitation, domestic
servitude, and forced labor; Burmese children are subjected to
conditions of forced labor in Thailand as hawkers, beggars, and for
work in shops, agriculture, fish processing, and small-scale
industries; women are trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation
to Malaysia and China; some trafficking victims transit Burma from
Bangladesh to Malaysia and from China to Thailand; internal
trafficking occurs primarily from villages to urban centers and
economic hubs for labor in industrial zones, agricultural estates,
and commercial sexual exploitation; military and civilian officials
continue to use a significant amount of forced labor; ethnic
insurgent groups also used compulsory labor of adults and unlawful
recruitment of children; the military junta's gross economic
mismanagement, human rights abuses, and its policy of using forced
labor are the top causal factors for Burma's significant trafficking
problem
tier rating: Tier 3 - Burma does not fully comply with the minimum
standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making
significant efforts to do so; military and civilian officials remain
directly involved in significant acts of forced labor and unlawful
conscription of child soldiers (2008)


Illicit drugs:

remains world's second-largest producer of illicit opium with an
estimated production in 2008 of 340 metric tons, an increase of 26%,
and cultivation in 2008 was 22,500 hectares, a 4% increase from
2007; production in the United Wa State Army's areas of greatest
control remains low; Shan state is the source of 94% of poppy
cultivation; lack of government will to take on major
narcotrafficking groups and lack of serious commitment against money
laundering continues to hinder the overall antidrug effort; major
source of methamphetamine and heroin for regional consumption;
currently under Financial Action Task Force countermeasures due to
continued failure to address its inadequate money-laundering
controls (2008)

@Burundi

Introduction
Burundi



Background:

Burundi's first democratically elected president was assassinated in
October 1993 after only 100 days in office, triggering widespread
ethnic violence between Hutu and Tutsi factions. More than 200,000
Burundians perished during the conflict that spanned almost a dozen
years. Hundreds of thousands of Burundians were internally displaced
or became refugees in neighboring countries. An internationally
brokered power-sharing agreement between the Tutsi-dominated
government and the Hutu rebels in 2003 paved the way for a
transition process that led to an integrated defense force,
established a new constitution in 2005, and elected a majority Hutu
government in 2005. The new government, led by President Pierre
NKURUNZIZA, signed a South African brokered ceasefire with the
country's last rebel group in September of 2006 but still faces many
challenges.

Economy
Burundi



Economy - overview:

Burundi is a landlocked, resource-poor country with an
underdeveloped manufacturing sector. The economy is predominantly
agricultural with more than 90% of the population dependent on
subsistence agriculture. Economic growth depends on coffee and tea
exports, which account for 90% of foreign exchange earnings. The
ability to pay for imports, therefore, rests primarily on weather
conditions and international coffee and tea prices. The Tutsi
minority, 14% of the population, dominates the government and the
coffee trade at the expense of the Hutu majority, 85% of the
population. An ethnic-based war that lasted for over a decade
resulted in more than 200,000 deaths, forced more than 48,000
refugees into Tanzania, and displaced 140,000 others internally.
Only one in two children go to school, and approximately one in 15
adults has HIV/AIDS. Food, medicine, and electricity remain in short
supply. Burundi's GDP grew around 5% annually in 2006-07. Political
stability and the end of the civil war have improved aid flows and
economic activity has increased, but underlying weaknesses - a high
poverty rate, poor education rates, a weak legal system, and low
administrative capacity - risk undermining planned economic reforms.
Burundi will continue to remain heavily dependent on aid from
bilateral and multilateral donors; the delay of funds after a
corruption scandal cut off bilateral aid in 2007 reduced
government's revenues and its ability to pay salaries.

Transnational Issues
Burundi



Disputes - international:

Burundi and Rwanda dispute sections of border on the
Akanyaru/Kanyaru and the Kagera/Nyabarongo rivers, which have
changed course since the 1960s, when the boundary was delimited;
cross-border conflicts among Tutsi, Hutu, other ethnic groups,
associated political rebels, armed gangs, and various government
forces persist in the Great Lakes region


Refugees and internally displaced persons:

refugees (country of origin): 9,849 (Democratic Republic of the
Congo)
IDPs: 100,000 (armed conflict between government and rebels; most
IDPs in northern and western Burundi) (2007)


Trafficking in persons:

current situation: Burundi is a source country for children
trafficked for the purposes of child soldiering, domestic servitude,
and commercial sexual exploitation; a small number of Burundian
children may be trafficked internally for domestic servitude or
commercial sexual exploitation; in early 2008, Burundian children
were allegedly trafficked to Uganda, via Rwanda, for agricultural
labor and commercial sexual exploitation
tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Burundi is on the Tier 2 Watch List
for the second consecutive year for its failure to provide
sufficient evidence of increasing efforts to combat trafficking in
persons in 2007; the government's inability to provide adequate
protective services to children accused of association with armed
groups and to conduct anti-trafficking law enforcement activities
continue to be causes for concern; Burundi has not ratified the 2000
UN TIP Protocol (2008)

Introduction
Cambodia



Background:

Most Cambodians consider themselves to be Khmers, descendants of the
Angkor Empire that extended over much of Southeast Asia and reached
its zenith between the 10th and 13th centuries. Attacks by the Thai
and Cham (from present-day Vietnam) weakened the empire, ushering in
a long period of decline. The king placed the country under French
protection in 1863 and it became part of French Indochina in 1887.
Following Japanese occupation in World War II, Cambodia gained full
independence from France in 1953. In April 1975, after a five-year
struggle, Communist Khmer Rouge forces captured Phnom Penh and
evacuated all cities and towns. At least 1.5 million Cambodians died
from execution, forced hardships, or starvation during the Khmer
Rouge regime under POL POT. A December 1978 Vietnamese invasion
drove the Khmer Rouge into the countryside, began a 10-year
Vietnamese occupation, and touched off almost 13 years of civil war.
The 1991 Paris Peace Accords mandated democratic elections and a
ceasefire, which was not fully respected by the Khmer Rouge.
UN-sponsored elections in 1993 helped restore some semblance of
normalcy under a coalition government. Factional fighting in 1997
ended the first coalition government, but a second round of national
elections in 1998 led to the formation of another coalition
government and renewed political stability. The remaining elements
of the Khmer Rouge surrendered in early 1999. Some of the remaining
Khmer Rouge leaders are awaiting trial by a UN-sponsored tribunal
for crimes against humanity. Elections in July 2003 were relatively
peaceful, but it took one year of negotiations between contending
political parties before a coalition government was formed. In
October 2004, King SIHANOUK abdicated the throne due to illness and
his son, Prince Norodom SIHAMONI, was selected to succeed him. Local
elections were held in Cambodia in April 2007, and there was little
in the way of pre-election violence that preceded prior elections.
National elections are scheduled for July 2008.

Economy
Cambodia



Economy - overview:

From 2001 to 2004, the economy grew at an average rate of 6.4%,
driven largely by an expansion in the garment sector and tourism.
The US and Cambodia signed a Bilateral Textile Agreement, which gave
Cambodia a guaranteed quota of US textile imports and established a
bonus for improving working conditions and enforcing Cambodian labor
laws and international labor standards in the industry. With the
January 2005 expiration of a WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing,
Cambodia-based textile producers were forced to compete directly
with lower-priced producing countries such as China and India.
Better-than-expected garment sector performance led to more than 9%
growth in 2007. Its vibrant garment industry employs more than
350,000 people and contributes more than 70% of Cambodia's exports.
The Cambodian government has committed itself to a policy supporting
high labor standards in an attempt to maintain buyer interest. In
2005, exploitable oil and natural gas deposits were found beneath
Cambodia's territorial waters, representing a new revenue stream for
the government if commercial extraction begins. Mining also is
attracting significant investor interest, particularly in the
northeastern parts of the country, and the government has said
opportunities exist for mining bauxite, gold, iron and gems. In
2006, a US-Cambodia bilateral Trade and Investment Framework
Agreement (TIFA) was signed and the first round of discussions took
place in early 2007. The tourism industry continues to grow rapidly,
with foreign arrivals reaching 2 million in 2007. In 2007 the
government signed a joint venture agreement with two companies to
form a new national airline. The long-term development of the
economy remains a daunting challenge. The Cambodian government is
working with bilateral and multilateral donors, including the World
Bank and IMF, to address the country's many pressing needs. The
major economic challenge for Cambodia over the next decade will be
fashioning an economic environment in which the private sector can
create enough jobs to handle Cambodia's demographic imbalance. More
than 50% of the population is less than 21 years old. The population
lacks education and productive skills, particularly in the
poverty-ridden countryside, which suffers from an almost total lack
of basic infrastructure.

Cameroon



Background:

The former French Cameroon and part of British Cameroon merged in
1961 to form the present country. Cameroon has generally enjoyed

Economy
Cameroon



Economy - overview:

Because of its modest oil resources and favorable agricultural
conditions, Cameroon has one of the best-endowed primary commodity
economies in sub-Saharan Africa. Still, it faces many of the serious
problems facing other underdeveloped countries, such as a top-heavy
civil service and a generally unfavorable climate for business
enterprise. Since 1990, the government has embarked on various IMF
and World Bank programs designed to spur business investment,
increase efficiency in agriculture, improve trade, and recapitalize
the nation's banks. In June 2000, the government completed an
IMF-sponsored, three-year structural adjustment program; however,
the IMF is pressing for more reforms, including increased budget
transparency, privatization, and poverty reduction programs. In
January 2001, the Paris Club agreed to reduce Cameroon's debt of
$1.3 billion by $900 million; debt relief now totals $1.26 billion.
International oil and cocoa prices have a significant impact on the
economy.

country for women and children trafficked for the purposes of forced
labor and commercial sexual exploitation; most victims are children
trafficked within country, with girls primarily trafficked for
domestic servitude and sexual exploitation; both boys and girls are
also trafficked within Cameroon for forced labor in sweatshops,
bars, restaurants, and on tea and cocoa plantations; children are
trafficked into Cameroon from neighboring states for forced labor in
agriculture, fishing, street vending, and spare-parts shops;
Cameroon is a transit country for children trafficked between Gabon
and Nigeria, and from Nigeria to Saudi Arabia; it is a source
country for women transported by sex-trafficking rings to Europe
tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Cameroon is on the Tier 2 Watch
List for its failure to provide evidence of increasing efforts to
combat human trafficking in 2007, particularly in terms of efforts
to prosecute and convict trafficking offenders; while Cameroon
reported some arrests of traffickers, none of them were prosecuted
or punished; the government does not identify trafficking victims
among vulnerable populations nor does it monitor the number of
victims it intercepts (2008)

Introduction
Canada



Background:

A land of vast distances and rich natural resources, Canada became a
self-governing dominion in 1867 while retaining ties to the British
crown. Economically and technologically the nation has developed in
parallel with the US, its neighbor to the south across an
unfortified border. Canada faces the political challenges of meeting
public demands for quality improvements in health care and education
services, as well as responding to separatist concerns in
predominantly francophone Quebec. Canada also aims to develop its
diverse energy resources while maintaining its commitment to the
environment.

Economy
Canada



Economy - overview:

As an affluent, high-tech industrial society in the trillion-dollar
class, Canada resembles the US in its market-oriented economic
system, pattern of production, and affluent living standards. Since
World War II, the impressive growth of the manufacturing, mining,
and service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural
economy into one primarily industrial and urban. The 1989 US-Canada
Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and the 1994 North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA) (which includes Mexico) touched off a dramatic
increase in trade and economic integration with the US. Given its
great natural resources, skilled labor force, and modern capital
plant, Canada enjoys solid economic prospects. Top-notch fiscal
management has produced consecutive balanced budgets since 1997,
although public debate continues over the equitable distribution of
federal funds to the Canadian provinces. Exports account for roughly
a third of GDP. Canada enjoys a substantial trade surplus with its
principal trading partner, the US, which absorbs 80% of Canadian
exports each year. Canada is the US's largest foreign supplier of
energy, including oil, gas, uranium, and electric power. During
2007, Canada enjoyed good economic growth, moderate inflation, and
the lowest unemployment rate in more than three decades.

Introduction
Cape Verde



Background:

The uninhabited islands were discovered and colonized by the
Portuguese in the 15th century; Cape Verde subsequently became a
trading center for African slaves and later an important coaling and
resupply stop for whaling and transatlantic shipping. Following
independence in 1975, and a tentative interest in unification with
Guinea-Bissau, a one-party system was established and maintained
until multi-party elections were held in 1990. Cape Verde continues
to exhibit one of Africa's most stable democratic governments.
Repeated droughts during the second half of the 20th century caused
significant hardship and prompted heavy emigration. As a result,
Cape Verde's expatriate population is greater than its domestic one.
Most Cape Verdeans have both African and Portuguese antecedents.

Economy
Cape Verde



Economy - overview:

This island economy suffers from a poor natural resource base,
including serious water shortages exacerbated by cycles of long-term
drought. The economy is service-oriented, with commerce, transport,
tourism, and public services accounting for about three-fourths of
GDP. Although nearly 70% of the population lives in rural areas, the
share of food production in GDP is low. About 82% of food must be
imported. The fishing potential, mostly lobster and tuna, is not
fully exploited. Cape Verde annually runs a high trade deficit,
financed by foreign aid and remittances from emigrants; remittances
supplement GDP by more than 20%. Economic reforms are aimed at
developing the private sector and attracting foreign investment to
diversify the economy. Future prospects depend heavily on the
maintenance of aid flows, the encouragement of tourism, remittances,
and the momentum of the government's development program. Cape Verde
became a member of the WTO in July 2008.

@Central African Republic

Introduction
Central African Republic



Background:

The former French colony of Ubangi-Shari became the Central African
Republic upon independence in 1960. After three tumultuous decades
of misrule - mostly by military governments - civilian rule was
established in 1993 and lasted for one decade. President Ange-Felix
PATASSE's civilian government was plagued by unrest, and in March
2003 he was deposed in a military coup led by General Francois
BOZIZE, who established a transitional government. Though the
government has the tacit support of civil society groups and the
main parties, a wide field of candidates contested the municipal,
legislative, and presidential elections held in March and May of
2005 in which General BOZIZE was affirmed as president. The
government still does not fully control the countryside, where
pockets of lawlessness persist. Unrest in neighboring nations, Chad,
Sudan, and the DRC, continues to affect stability in the Central
African Republic as well.

Economy
Central African Republic



Economy - overview:

Subsistence agriculture, together with forestry, remains the
backbone of the economy of the Central African Republic (CAR), with
more than 70% of the population living in outlying areas. The
agricultural sector generates more than half of GDP. Timber has
accounted for about 16% of export earnings and the diamond industry,
for 40%. Important constraints to economic development include the
CAR's landlocked position, a poor transportation system, a largely
unskilled work force, and a legacy of misdirected macroeconomic
policies. Factional fighting between the government and its
opponents remains a drag on economic revitalization. Distribution of
income is extraordinarily unequal. Grants from France and the
international community can only partially meet humanitarian needs.

Trafficking in persons:

current situation: Central African Republic is a source, transit,
and destination country for men, women, and children trafficked for
the purposes of forced labor and sexual exploitation; the majority
of victims are children trafficked within the country for sexual
exploitation, domestic servitude, street vending, and forced
agricultural, mine, market and restaurant labor; to a lesser extent,
children are trafficked from the Central African Republic to
Cameroon, Nigeria, and the Democratic Republic of Congo; rebels
conscript children into armed forces within the country
tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Central African Republic is on the
Tier 2 Watch List for the third consecutive year for its failure to
show evidence of increasing efforts to combat trafficking in 2007;
efforts to address trafficking through vigorous law enforcement
measures and victim protection efforts were minimal, though
awareness about trafficking appeared to be increasing in the
country; the government does not actively investigate cases, work to
identify trafficking victims among vulnerable populations, or rescue
and provide care to victims; the government has not taken measures
to reduce demand for commercial sex acts (2008)

Introduction
Chad



Background:

Chad, part of France's African holdings until 1960, endured three
decades of civil warfare as well as invasions by Libya before a
semblance of peace was finally restored in 1990. The government
eventually drafted a democratic constitution, and held flawed
presidential elections in 1996 and 2001. In 1998, a rebellion broke
out in northern Chad, which has sporadically flared up despite
several peace agreements between the government and the rebels. In
2005, new rebel groups emerged in western Sudan and made probing
attacks into eastern Chad, despite signing peace agreements in
December 2006 and October 2007. Power remains in the hands of an
ethnic minority. In June 2005, President Idriss DEBY held a
referendum successfully removing constitutional term limits and won
another controversial election in 2006. Sporadic rebel campaigns
continued throughout 2006 and 2007, and the capital experienced a
significant rebel threat in early 2008.

Economy
Chad



Economy - overview:

Chad's primarily agricultural economy will continue to be boosted by
major foreign direct investment projects in the oil sector that
began in 2000. At least 80% of Chad's population relies on
subsistence farming and livestock raising for its livelihood. Chad's
economy has long been handicapped by its landlocked position, high
energy costs, and a history of instability. Chad relies on foreign
assistance and foreign capital for most public and private sector
investment projects. A consortium led by two US companies has been
investing $3.7 billion to develop oil reserves - estimated at 1
billion barrels - in southern Chad. Chinese companies are also
expanding exploration efforts and plan to build a refinery. The
nation's total oil reserves have been estimated to be 1.5 billion
barrels. Oil production came on stream in late 2003. Chad began to
export oil in 2004. Cotton, cattle, and gum arabic provide the bulk
of Chad's non-oil export earnings.

Central African Republic, and Nigeria for cattle herding; children
may also be trafficked from Cameroon and the Central African
Republic to Chad's oil producing regions for sexual exploitation
tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Chad is on the Tier 2 Watch List
for its failure to provide evidence of increasing efforts to combat

civil conflict leading to a declared state of emergency in February
2008, and a steady influx of refugees fleeing Sudan and the Central
African Republic; the government demonstrated insufficient overall
efforts to combat trafficking; Chad has not ratified the 2000 UN TIP
Protocol (2008)

Introduction
Chile



Background:

Prior to the coming of the Spanish in the 16th century, northern
Chile was under Inca rule while Araucanian Indians (also known as
Mapuches) inhabited central and southern Chile. Although Chile
declared its independence in 1810, decisive victory over the Spanish
was not achieved until 1818. In the War of the Pacific (1879-83),
Chile defeated Peru and Bolivia and won its present northern
regions. It was not until the 1880s that the Araucanian Indians were
completely subjugated. A three-year-old Marxist government of
Salvador ALLENDE was overthrown in 1973 by a military coup led by
Augusto PINOCHET, who ruled until a freely elected president was
installed in 1990. Sound economic policies, maintained consistently
since the 1980s, have contributed to steady growth, reduced poverty
rates by over half, and have helped secure the country's commitment
to democratic and representative government. Chile has increasingly
assumed regional and international leadership roles befitting its
status as a stable, democratic nation.

Economy
Chile



Economy - overview:

Chile has a market-oriented economy characterized by a high level of
foreign trade. During the early 1990s, Chile's reputation as a role
model for economic reform was strengthened when the democratic
government of Patricio AYLWIN - which took over from the military in
1990 - deepened the economic reform initiated by the military
government. Growth in real GDP averaged 8% during 1991-97, but fell
to half that level in 1998 because of tight monetary policies
implemented to keep the current account deficit in check and because
of lower export earnings - the latter a product of the global
financial crisis. A severe drought exacerbated the recession in
1999, reducing crop yields and causing hydroelectric shortfalls and
electricity rationing, and Chile experienced negative economic
growth for the first time in more than 15 years. Despite the effects
of the recession, Chile maintained its reputation for strong
financial institutions and sound policy that have given it the
strongest sovereign bond rating in South America. Between 2000 and
2007 growth ranged between 2%-6%. Throughout these years Chile
maintained a low rate of inflation with GDP growth coming from high
copper prices, solid export earnings (particularly forestry,
fishing, and mining), and growing domestic consumption. President
BACHELET in 2006 established an Economic and Social Stabilization
Fund to hold excess copper revenues so that social spending can be
maintained during periods of copper shortfalls. This fund probably
surpassed $20 billion at the end of 2007. Chile continues to attract
foreign direct investment, but most foreign investment goes into
gas, water, electricity and mining. Unemployment has exhibited a
downward trend over the past two years, dropping to 7.8% and 7.0% at
the end of 2006 and 2007, respectively. Chile deepened its
longstanding commitment to trade liberalization with the signing of
a free trade agreement with the US, which took effect on 1 January
2004. Chile claims to have more bilateral or regional trade
agreements than any other country. It has 57 such agreements (not
all of them full free trade agreements), including with the European
Union, Mercosur, China, India, South Korea, and Mexico.

Transnational Issues
Chile



Disputes - international:

Chile and Peru rebuff Bolivia's reinvigorated claim to restore the
Atacama corridor, ceded to Chile in 1884, but Chile has offered
instead unrestricted but not sovereign maritime access through Chile
to Bolivian gas and other commodities; Chile rejects Peru's
unilateral legislation to change its latitudinal maritime boundary
with Chile to an equidistance line with a southwestern axis favoring
Peru, in October 2007, Peru took its maritime complaint with Chile
to the ICJ; territorial claim in Antarctica (Chilean Antarctic
Territory) partially overlaps Argentine and British claims; the
joint boundary commission, established by Chile and Argentina in
2001, has yet to map and demarcate the delimited boundary in the
inhospitable Andean Southern Ice Field (Campo de Hielo Sur)


Illicit drugs:

transshipment country for cocaine destined for Europe and the
region; economic prosperity and increasing trade have made Chile
more attractive to traffickers seeking to launder drug profits,
especially through the Iquique Free Trade Zone, but a recent
anti-money-laundering law improves controls; imported precursors
passed on to Bolivia; domestic cocaine consumption is rising, making
Chile a significant consumer of cocaine

Introduction
China



Background:

For centuries China stood as a leading civilization, outpacing the
rest of the world in the arts and sciences, but in the 19th and
early 20th centuries, the country was beset by civil unrest, major
famines, military defeats, and foreign occupation. After World War
II, the Communists under MAO Zedong established an autocratic
socialist system that, while ensuring China's sovereignty, imposed
strict controls over everyday life and cost the lives of tens of
millions of people. After 1978, his successor DENG Xiaoping and
other leaders focused on market-oriented economic development and by
2000 output had quadrupled. For much of the population, living
standards have improved dramatically and the room for personal
choice has expanded, yet political controls remain tight.

Economy
China



Economy - overview:

China's economy during the last quarter century has changed from a
centrally planned system that was largely closed to international
trade to a more market-oriented economy that has a rapidly growing
private sector and is a major player in the global economy. Reforms
started in the late 1970s with the phasing out of collectivized
agriculture, and expanded to include the gradual liberalization of
prices, fiscal decentralization, increased autonomy for state
enterprises, the foundation of a diversified banking system, the
development of stock markets, the rapid growth of the non-state
sector, and the opening to foreign trade and investment. China has
generally implemented reforms in a gradualist or piecemeal fashion,
including the sale of minority shares in four of China's largest
state banks to foreign investors and refinements in foreign exchange
and bond markets in 2005. After keeping its currency tightly linked
to the US dollar for years, China in July 2005 revalued its currency
by 2.1% against the US dollar and moved to an exchange rate system
that references a basket of currencies. Cumulative appreciation of
the renminbi against the US dollar since the end of the dollar peg
reached 15% in January 2008. The restructuring of the economy and
resulting efficiency gains have contributed to a more than tenfold
increase in GDP since 1978. Measured on a purchasing power parity
(PPP) basis, China in 2007 stood as the second-largest economy in
the world after the US, although in per capita terms the country is
still lower middle-income. Annual inflows of foreign direct
investment in 2007 rose to $75 billion. By the end of 2007, more
than 5,000 domestic Chinese enterprises had established direct
investments in 172 countries and regions around the world. The
Chinese government faces several economic development challenges:
(a) to sustain adequate job growth for tens of millions of workers
laid off from state-owned enterprises, migrants, and new entrants to
the work force; (b) to reduce corruption and other economic crimes;
and (c) to contain environmental damage and social strife related to
the economy's rapid transformation. Economic development has been
more rapid in coastal provinces than in the interior, and
approximately 200 million rural laborers have relocated to urban
areas to find work. One demographic consequence of the "one child"
policy is that China is now one of the most rapidly aging countries
in the world. Deterioration in the environment - notably air
pollution, soil erosion, and the steady fall of the water table,
especially in the north - is another long-term problem. China
continues to lose arable land because of erosion and economic
development. In 2007 China intensified government efforts to improve
environmental conditions, tying the evaluation of local officials to
environmental targets, publishing a national climate change policy,
and establishing a high level leading group on climate change,
headed by Premier WEN Jiabao. The Chinese government seeks to add
energy production capacity from sources other than coal and oil as
its double-digit economic growth increases demand. Chinese energy
officials in 2007 agreed to purchase five third generation nuclear
reactors from Western companies. More power generating capacity came
on line in 2006 as large scale investments - including the Three
Gorges Dam across the Yangtze River - were completed.

Transnational Issues
China



Disputes - international:

continuing talks and confidence-building measures work toward
reducing tensions over Kashmir that nonetheless remains militarized
with portions under the de facto administration of China (Aksai
Chin), India (Jammu and Kashmir), and Pakistan (Azad Kashmir and
Northern Areas); India does not recognize Pakistan's ceding historic
Kashmir lands to China in 1964; China and India continue their
security and foreign policy dialogue started in 2005 related to the
dispute over most of their rugged, militarized boundary, regional
nuclear proliferation, and other matters; China claims most of
India's Arunachal Pradesh to the base of the Himalayas; lacking any
treaty describing the boundary, Bhutan and China continue
negotiations to establish a common boundary alignment to resolve
territorial disputes due to cartographic discrepancies; Chinese maps
show an international boundary symbol off the coasts of the littoral
states of the South China Seas, where China has interrupted
Vietnamese hydrocarbon exploration; China asserts sovereignty over
the Spratly Islands together with Malaysia, Philippines, Taiwan,
Vietnam, and possibly Brunei; the 2002 "Declaration on the Conduct
of Parties in the South China Sea" eased tensions in the Spratly's
but is not the legally binding "code of conduct" sought by some
parties; Vietnam and China continue to expand construction of
facilities in the Spratly's and in March 2005, the national oil
companies of China, the Philippines, and Vietnam signed a joint
accord on marine seismic activities in the Spratly Islands; China
occupies some of the Paracel Islands also claimed by Vietnam and
Taiwan; China and Taiwan continue to reject both Japan's claims to
the uninhabited islands of Senkaku-shoto (Diaoyu Tai) and Japan's
unilaterally declared equidistance line in the East China Sea, the
site of intensive hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation; certain
islands in the Yalu and Tumen rivers are in dispute with North
Korea; North Korea and China seek to stem illegal migration to China
by North Koreans, fleeing privations and oppression, by building a
fence along portions of the border and imprisoning North Koreans
deported by China; China and Russia have demarcated the once
disputed islands at the Amur and Ussuri confluence and in the Argun
River in accordance with their 2004 Agreement; China and Tajikistan
have begun demarcating the revised boundary agreed to in the
delimitation of 2002; the decade-long demarcation of the
China-Vietnam land boundary is expected to be completed by the end
of 2008, while the maritime boundary delimitation and fisheries
agreements in the Gulf of Tonkin, ratified in June 2004, have been
implemented; citing environmental, cultural, and social concerns,
China has reconsidered construction of 13 dams on the Salween River,
but energy-starved Burma, with backing from Thailand, remains intent
on building five hydro-electric dams downstream despite regional and
international protests; Chinese and Hong Kong authorities met in
March 2008 to resolve ownership and use of lands recovered in
Shenzhen River channelization, including 96-hectare Lok Ma Chau
Loop; Hong Kong developing plans to reduce 2,000 out of 2,800
hectares of its restricted Closed Area by 2010


Refugees and internally displaced persons:

refugees (country of origin): 300,897 (Vietnam); estimated
30,000-50,000 (North Korea)
IDPs: 90,000 (2007)


Trafficking in persons:

current situation: China is a source, transit, and destination
country for men, women, and children trafficked for the purposes of
sexual exploitation and forced labor; the majority of trafficking in
China occurs within the country's borders, but there is also
considerable international trafficking of Chinese citizens to
Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and North
America; Chinese women are lured abroad through false promises of
legitimate employment, only to be forced into commercial sexual
exploitation, largely in Taiwan, Thailand, Malaysia, and Japan;
women and children are trafficked to China from Mongolia, Burma,
North Korea, Russia, and Vietnam for forced labor, marriage, and
prostitution; some North Korean women and children seeking to leave
their country voluntarily cross the border into China and are then
sold into prostitution, marriage, or forced labor
tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - China is on the Tier 2 Watch List
for the fourth consecutive year for its failure to provide evidence
of increasing efforts to combat human trafficking, particularly in
terms of punishment of trafficking crimes and the protection of
Chinese and foreign victims of trafficking; victims are sometimes
punished for unlawful acts that were committed as a direct result of
their being trafficked, such as violations of prostitution or
immigration/emigration controls; the Chinese Government continued to
treat North Korean victims of trafficking solely as economic
migrants, routinely deporting them back to horrendous conditions in
North Korea; additional challenges facing the Chinese Government
include the enormous size of its trafficking problem and the
significant level of corruption and complicity in trafficking by
some local government officials (2008)


Illicit drugs:

major transshipment point for heroin produced in the Golden Triangle
region of Southeast Asia; growing domestic drug abuse problem;
source country for chemical precursors, despite new regulations on
its large chemical industry

@Cocos (Keeling) Islands

Introduction
Cocos (Keeling) Islands



Background:

There are 27 coral islands in the group. Captain William KEELING
discovered the islands in 1609, but they remained uninhabited until
the 19th century. From the 1820s to 1978, members of the CLUNIE-ROSS
family controlled the islands and the copra produced from local
coconuts. Annexed by the UK in 1857, the Cocos Islands were
transferred to the Australian Government in 1955. The population on
the two inhabited islands generally is split between the ethnic
Europeans on West Island and the ethnic Malays on Home Island.

@Colombia

Introduction
Colombia



Background:

Colombia was one of the three countries that emerged from the
collapse of Gran Colombia in 1830 (the others are Ecuador and
Venezuela). A 40-year conflict between government forces and
anti-government insurgent groups and illegal paramilitary groups -
both heavily funded by the drug trade - escalated during the 1990s.
The insurgents lack the military or popular support necessary to
overthrow the government, and violence has been decreasing since
about 2002, but insurgents continue attacks against civilians and
large swaths of the countryside are under guerrilla influence. More
than 32,000 former paramilitaries had demobilized by the end of 2006
and the United Self Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) as a formal
organization had ceased to function. Still, some renegades continued
to engage in criminal activities. The Colombian Government has
stepped up efforts to reassert government control throughout the
country, and now has a presence in every one of its administrative
departments. However, neighboring countries worry about the violence
spilling over their borders.

Economy
Colombia



Economy - overview:

Colombia's economy has experienced positive growth over the past
five years despite a serious armed conflict. In fact, 2007 is
regarded by policy makers and the private sector as one of the best
economic years in recent history, after 2005. The economy continues
to improve in part because of austere government budgets, focused
efforts to reduce public debt levels, an export-oriented growth
strategy, improved domestic security, and high commodity prices.
Ongoing economic problems facing President URIBE include reforming
the pension system, reducing high unemployment, and funding new
exploration to offset declining oil production. The government's
economic reforms and democratic security strategy, coupled with
increased investment, have engendered a growing sense of confidence
in the economy. However, the business sector continues to be
concerned about failure of the US Congress to approve the signed FTA.

coca cultivator with 167,000 hectares in coca cultivation in 2007, a
6% increase over 2006, producing a potential of 535 metric tons of
pure cocaine; the world's largest producer of coca derivatives;
supplies cocaine to most of the US market and the great majority of
other international drug markets; in 2007, aerial eradication
dispensed herbicide to treat over 153,000 hectares with another
67,000 hectares manually eradicated, but aggressive replanting on
the part of coca growers means Colombia remains a key producer; a
significant portion of non-US narcotics proceeds are either
laundered or invested in Colombia through the black market peso
exchange; important supplier of heroin to the US market; opium poppy
cultivation is estimated to have fallen 25% between 2006 and 2007
with a corresponding estimated 27% decline in the yield of pure
heroin to 1.9 metric tons; (2007)

Introduction
Comoros



Background:

Comoros has endured more than 20 coups or attempted coups since
gaining independence from France in 1975. In 1997, the islands of
Anjouan and Moheli declared independence from Comoros. In 1999,
military chief Col. AZALI seized power in a bloodless coup, and
helped negotiate the 2000 Fomboni Accords power-sharing agreement in
which the federal presidency rotates among the three islands, and
each island maintains its own local government. AZALI won the 2002
Presidential election, and each island in the archipelago elected
its own president. AZALI stepped down in 2006 and President SAMBI
took office. Since 2006, Anjouan's President Mohamed BACAR has
refused to work effectively with the Union presidency. In 2007,
BACAR effected Anjouan's de-facto secession from the Union, refusing
to step down in favor of fresh Anjouanais elections when Comoros'
other islands held legitimate elections in July. The African Union
(AU) initially attempted to resolve the political crisis by applying
sanctions and a naval blockade on Anjouan, but in March 2008, AU and
Comoran soldiers seized the island. The move was generally welcomed
by the island's inhabitants.

Economy
Comoros



Economy - overview:

One of the world's poorest countries, Comoros is made up of three
islands that have inadequate transportation links, a young and
rapidly increasing population, and few natural resources. The low
educational level of the labor force contributes to a subsistence
level of economic activity, high unemployment, and a heavy
dependence on foreign grants and technical assistance. Agriculture,
including fishing, hunting, and forestry, contributes 40% to GDP,
employs 80% of the labor force, and provides most of the exports.
The country is not self-sufficient in food production; rice, the
main staple, accounts for the bulk of imports. The government -
which is hampered by internal political disputes - is struggling to
upgrade education and technical training, privatize commercial and
industrial enterprises, improve health services, diversify exports,
promote tourism, and reduce the high population growth rate. The
political problems caused the economy to contract in 2007.
Remittances from 150,000 Comorans abroad help supplement GDP.

Introduction
Congo, Democratic Republic of the



Background:

Established as a Belgian colony in 1908, the Republic of the Congo
gained its independence in 1960, but its early years were marred by
political and social instability. Col. Joseph MOBUTU seized power
and declared himself president in a November 1965 coup. He
subsequently changed his name - to MOBUTU Sese Seko - as well as
that of the country - to Zaire. MOBUTU retained his position for 32
years through several sham elections, as well as through the use of
brutal force. Ethnic strife and civil war, touched off by a massive
inflow of refugees in 1994 from fighting in Rwanda and Burundi, led
in May 1997 to the toppling of the MOBUTU regime by a rebellion
backed by Rwanda and Uganda and fronted by Laurent KABILA. He
renamed the country the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), but
in August 1998 his regime was itself challenged by a second
insurrection again backed by Rwanda and Uganda. Troops from Angola,
Chad, Namibia, Sudan, and Zimbabwe intervened to support KABILA's
regime. A cease-fire was signed in July 1999 by the DRC, Congolese
armed rebel groups, Angola, Namibia, Rwanda, Uganda, and Zimbabwe
but sporadic fighting continued. Laurent KABILA was assassinated in
January 2001 and his son, Joseph KABILA, was named head of state. In
October 2002, the new president was successful in negotiating the
withdrawal of Rwandan forces occupying eastern Congo; two months
later, the Pretoria Accord was signed by all remaining warring
parties to end the fighting and establish a government of national
unity. A transitional government was set up in July 2003. Joseph
KABILA as president and four vice presidents represented the former
government, former rebel groups, the political opposition, and civil
society. The transitional government held a successful
constitutional referendum in December 2005 and elections for the
presidency, National Assembly, and provincial legislatures in 2006.
KABILA was inaugurated president in December 2006. The National
Assembly was installed in September 2006. Its president, Vital
KAMERHE, was chosen in December. Provincial assemblies were
constituted in early 2007, and elected governors and national
senators in January 2007.

Economy
Congo, Democratic Republic of the



Economy - overview:

The economy of the Democratic Republic of the Congo - a nation
endowed with vast potential wealth - is slowly recovering from two
decades of decline. Conflict, which began in August 1998,
dramatically reduced national output and government revenue,
increased external debt, and resulted in the deaths of more than 3.5
million people from violence, famine, and disease. Foreign
businesses curtailed operations due to uncertainty about the outcome
of the conflict, lack of infrastructure, and the difficult operating
environment. Conditions began to improve in late 2002 with the
withdrawal of a large portion of the invading foreign troops. The
transitional government reopened relations with international
financial institutions and international donors, and President
KABILA has begun implementing reforms, although progress is slow and
the International Monetary Fund curtailed their program for the DRC
at the end of March 2006 because of fiscal overruns. Much economic
activity still occurs in the informal sector, and is not reflected
in GDP data. Renewed activity in the mining sector, the source of
most export income, boosted Kinshasa's fiscal position and GDP
growth. Government reforms and improved security may lead to
increased government revenues, outside budget assistance, and
foreign direct investment, although an uncertain legal framework,
corruption, and a lack of transparency in government policy are
continuing long-term problems.

16,500 uniformed peacekeepers; members of Uganda's Lords Resistance
Army forces continue to seek refuge in Congo's Garamba National Park
as peace talks with the Uganda government evolve; the location of
the boundary in the broad Congo River with the Republic of the Congo
is indefinite except in the Pool Malebo/Stanley Pool area; Uganda
and DROC dispute Rukwanzi island in Lake Albert and other areas on
the Semliki River with hydrocarbon potential; boundary commission
continues discussions over Congolese-administered triangle of land
on the right bank of the Lunkinda river claimed by Zambia near the
DROC village of Pweto

Congo)
IDPs: 1.4 million (fighting between government forces and rebels
since mid-1990s; most IDPs are in eastern provinces) (2007)


Trafficking in persons:

current situation: Democratic Republic of the Congo is a source and
destination country for men, women, and children trafficked for the
purposes of forced labor and sexual exploitation; much of this
trafficking occurs within the country's unstable eastern provinces
and is perpetrated by armed groups outside government control
tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Democratic Republic of the Congo is
on the Tier 2 Watch List for its failure to provide evidence of
increasing efforts to combat trafficking in persons in 2007; while
some significant initial advances were noted, the government's
capacity to apprehend, convict, or imprison traffickers remained
weak; the government lacks sufficient financial, technical, and
human resources to effectively address not only trafficking crimes,
but also to provide basic levels of security in some parts of the
country (2008)


Illicit drugs:

one of Africa's biggest producers of cannabis, but mostly for
domestic consumption; while rampant corruption and inadequate
supervision leaves the banking system vulnerable to money
laundering, the lack of a well-developed financial system limits the
country's utility as a money-laundering center

Introduction
Congo, Republic of the



Background:

Upon independence in 1960, the former French region of Middle Congo
became the Republic of the Congo. A quarter century of
experimentation with Marxism was abandoned in 1990 and a
democratically elected government took office in 1992. A brief civil
war in 1997 restored former Marxist President Denis SASSOU-NGUESSO,
and ushered in a period of ethnic and political unrest.
Southern-based rebel groups agreed to a final peace accord in March
2003, but the calm is tenuous and refugees continue to present a
humanitarian crisis. The Republic of Congo was once one of Africa's
largest petroleum producers, but with declining production it will
need new offshore oil finds to sustain its oil earnings over the
long term.

Economy
Congo, Republic of the



Economy - overview:

The economy is a mixture of subsistence agriculture, an industrial
sector based largely on oil, and support services, and a government
characterized by budget problems and overstaffing. Oil has
supplanted forestry as the mainstay of the economy, providing a
major share of government revenues and exports. In the early 1980s,
rapidly rising oil revenues enabled the government to finance
large-scale development projects with GDP growth averaging 5%
annually, one of the highest rates in Africa. The government has
mortgaged a substantial portion of its oil earnings through
oil-backed loans that have contributed to a growing debt burden and
chronic revenue shortfalls. Economic reform efforts have been
undertaken with the support of international organizations, notably
the World Bank and the IMF. However, the reform program came to a
halt in June 1997 when civil war erupted. Denis SASSOU-NGUESSO, who
returned to power when the war ended in October 1997, publicly
expressed interest in moving forward on economic reforms and
privatization and in renewing cooperation with international
financial institutions. Economic progress was badly hurt by slumping
oil prices and the resumption of armed conflict in December 1998,
which worsened the republic's budget deficit. The current
administration presides over an uneasy internal peace and faces
difficult economic challenges of stimulating recovery and reducing
poverty. Recovery of oil prices has boosted the economy's GDP and
near-term prospects. In March 2006, the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC) treatment for Congo.

street vending, and domestic servitude; children are trafficked from
other African countries for domestic servitude, forced market
vending, and forced labor in the fishing industry
tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Republic of the Congo is on the
Tier 2 Watch List for its failure to show evidence of increasing
efforts to combat trafficking in persons in 2007; struggling to
recover from six years of civil conflict that ended in 2003, the
Republic of the Congo's capacity to address trafficking is
handicapped; the government neither monitors its borders for
trafficking activity nor provides specialized anti-trafficking
training for law enforcement officials; the government does not
encourage victims to assist in trafficking investigations or
prosecutions, and has not taken measures to reduce demand for
commercial sex acts in the Republic of the Congo (2008)

@Cook Islands

Introduction
Cook Islands



Background:

Named after Captain COOK, who sighted them in 1770, the islands
became a British protectorate in 1888. By 1900, administrative
control was transferred to New Zealand; in 1965, residents chose
self-government in free association with New Zealand. The emigration
of skilled workers to New Zealand and government deficits are
continuing problems.

Economy
Cook Islands



Economy - overview:

Like many other South Pacific island nations, the Cook Islands'
economic development is hindered by the isolation of the country
from foreign markets, the limited size of domestic markets, lack of
natural resources, periodic devastation from natural disasters, and
inadequate infrastructure. Agriculture, employing about one-third of
the working population, provides the economic base with major
exports made up of copra and citrus fruit. Black pearls are the Cook
Islands' leading export. Manufacturing activities are limited to
fruit processing, clothing, and handicrafts. Trade deficits are
offset by remittances from emigrants and by foreign aid,
overwhelmingly from New Zealand. In the 1980s and 1990s, the country
lived beyond its means, maintaining a bloated public service and
accumulating a large foreign debt. Subsequent reforms, including the
sale of state assets, the strengthening of economic management, the
encouragement of tourism, and a debt restructuring agreement, have
rekindled investment and growth.

@Costa Rica

Introduction
Costa Rica



Background:

Although explored by the Spanish early in the 16th century, initial
attempts at colonizing Costa Rica proved unsuccessful due to a
combination of factors, including: disease from mosquito-infested
swamps, brutal heat, resistance by natives, and pirate raids. It was
not until 1563 that a permanent settlement of Cartago was
established in the cooler, fertile central highlands. The area
remained a colony for some two and a half centuries. In 1821, Costa
Rica became one of several Central American provinces that jointly
declared their independence from Spain. Two years later it joined
the United Provinces of Central America, but this federation
disintegrated in 1838, at which time Costa Rica proclaimed its
sovereignty and independence. Since the late 19th century, only two
brief periods of violence have marred the country's democratic
development. Although it still maintains a large agricultural
sector, Costa Rica has expanded its economy to include strong
technology and tourism industries. The standard of living is
relatively high. Land ownership is widespread.

Economy
Costa Rica



Economy - overview:

Costa Rica's basically stable economy depends on tourism,
agriculture, and electronics exports. Poverty has remained around
20% for nearly 20 years, and the strong social safety net that had
been put into place by the government has eroded due to increased
financial constraints on government expenditures. Immigration from
Nicaragua has increasingly become a concern for the government. The
estimated 300,000-500,000 Nicaraguans estimated to be in Costa Rica
legally and illegally are an important source of (mostly unskilled)
labor, but also place heavy demands on the social welfare system.
Foreign investors remain attracted by the country's political
stability and high education levels, as well as the fiscal
incentives offered in the free-trade zones. Exports have become more
diversified in the past 10 years due to the growth of the high-tech
manufacturing sector, which is dominated by the microprocessor
industry. Tourism continues to bring in foreign exchange, as Costa
Rica's impressive biodiversity makes it a key destination for
ecotourism. The government continues to grapple with its large
internal and external deficits and sizable internal debt. Reducing
inflation remains a difficult problem because of rising import
prices, labor market rigidities, and fiscal deficits. Tax and public
expenditure reforms will be necessary to close the budget gap. In
October 2007, a national referendum voted in favor of the US-Central
American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA).

@Cote d'Ivoire

Introduction
Cote d'Ivoire



Background:

Close ties to France since independence in 1960, the development of
cocoa production for export, and foreign investment made Cote
d'Ivoire one of the most prosperous of the West African states, but
did not protect it from political turmoil. In December 1999, a
military coup - the first ever in Cote d'Ivoire's history -
overthrew the government. Junta leader Robert GUEI blatantly rigged
elections held in late 2000 and declared himself the winner. Popular
protest forced him to step aside and brought Laurent GBAGBO into
power. Ivorian dissidents and disaffected members of the military
launched a failed coup attempt in September 2002. Rebel forces
claimed the northern half of the country, and in January 2003 were
granted ministerial positions in a unity government under the
auspices of the Linas-Marcoussis Peace Accord. President GBAGBO and
rebel forces resumed implementation of the peace accord in December
2003 after a three-month stalemate, but issues that sparked the
civil war, such as land reform and grounds for citizenship, remained
unresolved. In March 2007 President GBAGBO and former New Force
rebel leader Guillaume SORO signed the Ouagadougou Political
Agreement. As a result of the agreement, SORO joined GBAGBO's
government as Prime Minister and the two agreed to reunite the
country by dismantling the zone of confidence separating North from
South, integrate rebel forces into the national armed forces, and
hold elections. Several thousand French and UN troops remain in Cote
d'Ivoire to help the parties implement their commitments and to
support the peace process.

Economy
Cote d'Ivoire



Economy - overview:

Cote d'Ivoire is the world's largest producer and exporter of cocoa
beans and a significant producer and exporter of coffee and palm
oil. Consequently, the economy is highly sensitive to fluctuations
in international prices for these products, and, to a lesser extent,
in climatic conditions. Despite government attempts to diversify the
economy, it is still heavily dependent on agriculture and related
activities, engaging roughly 68% of the population. Since 2006, oil
and gas production have become more important engines of economic
activity than cocoa. According to IMF statistics, earnings from oil
and refined products were $1.3 billion in 2006, while cocoa-related
revenues were $1 billion during the same period. Cote d'Ivoire's
offshore oil and gas production has resulted in substantial crude
oil exports and provides sufficient natural gas to fuel electricity
exports to Ghana, Togo, Benin, Mali and Burkina Faso. Oil
exploration by a number of consortiums of private companies
continues offshore, and President GBAGBO has expressed hope that
daily crude output could reach 200,000 barrels per day (b/d) by the
end of the decade. Since the end of the civil war in 2003, political
turmoil has continued to damage the economy, resulting in the loss
of foreign investment and slow economic growth. GDP grew by 1.8% in
2006 and 1.7% in 2007. Per capita income has declined by 15% since
1999.

Transnational Issues
Cote d'Ivoire



Disputes - international:

despite the presence of over 9,000 UN forces (UNOCI) in Cote
d'Ivoire since 2004, ethnic conflict still leaves displaced hundreds
of thousands of Ivorians in and out of the country as well as driven
out migrants from neighboring states who worked in Ivorian cocoa
plantations; the March 2007 peace deal between Ivorian rebels and
the government brought significant numbers of rebels out of hiding
in neighboring states


Refugees and internally displaced persons:

refugees (country of origin): 25,615 (Liberia)
IDPs: 709,000 (2002 coup; most IDPs are in western regions) (2007)


Trafficking in persons:

Cote d'Ivoire is a source, transit, and destination country for
women and children trafficked for forced labor and commercial sexual
exploitation; trafficking within the country is more prevalent than
international trafficking and the majority of victims are children;
women and girls are trafficked from northern areas to southern
cities for domestic servitude, restaurant labor, and sexual
exploitation; boys are trafficked internally for agricultural and
service labor and transnationally for forced labor in agriculture,
mining, construction, and in the fishing industry; women and girls
are trafficked to and from other West and Central African countries
for domestic servitude and forced street vending
tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Cote d'Ivoire is on the Tier 2
Watch List for its failure to provide evidence of increasing efforts
to eliminate trafficking in 2007, particularly with regard to its
law enforcement efforts and protection of sex trafficking victims;
in addition, Ivoirian law does not prohibit all forms of
trafficking, and Cote d'Ivoire has not ratified the 2000 UN TIP
Protocol (2008)


Illicit drugs:

illicit producer of cannabis, mostly for local consumption; utility
as a narcotic transshipment point to Europe reduced by ongoing
political instability; while rampant corruption and inadequate
supervision leave the banking system vulnerable to money laundering,
the lack of a developed financial system limits the country's
utility as a major money-laundering center

Introduction
Croatia



Background:

The lands that today comprise Croatia were part of the
Austro-Hungarian Empire until the close of World War I. In 1918, the
Croats, Serbs, and Slovenes formed a kingdom known after 1929 as
Yugoslavia. Following World War II, Yugoslavia became a federal
independent Communist state under the strong hand of Marshal TITO.
Although Croatia declared its independence from Yugoslavia in 1991,
it took four years of sporadic, but often bitter, fighting before
occupying Serb armies were mostly cleared from Croatian lands. Under
UN supervision, the last Serb-held enclave in eastern Slavonia was
returned to Croatia in 1998.

Economy
Croatia



Economy - overview:

Once one of the wealthiest of the Yugoslav republics, Croatia's
economy suffered badly during the 1991-95 war as output collapsed
and the country missed the early waves of investment in Central and
Eastern Europe that followed the fall of the Berlin Wall. Since
2000, however, Croatia's economic fortunes have begun to improve
slowly, with moderate but steady GDP growth between 4% and 6% led by
a rebound in tourism and credit-driven consumer spending. Inflation
over the same period has remained tame and the currency, the kuna,
stable. Nevertheless, difficult problems still remain, including a
stubbornly high unemployment rate, a growing trade deficit and
uneven regional development. The state retains a large role in the
economy, as privatization efforts often meet stiff public and
political resistance. While macroeconomic stabilization has largely
been achieved, structural reforms lag because of deep resistance on
the part of the public and lack of strong support from politicians.
The EU accession process should accelerate fiscal and structural
reform.

Transnational Issues
Croatia



Disputes - international:

dispute remains with Bosnia and Herzegovina over several small
disputed sections of the boundary related to maritime access that
hinders ratification of the 1999 border agreement; the
Croatia-Slovenia land and maritime boundary agreement, which would
have ceded most of Pirin Bay and maritime access to Slovenia and
several villages to Croatia, remains un-ratified and in dispute;
Slovenia also protests Croatia's 2003 claim to an exclusive economic
zone in the Adriatic; as a European Union peripheral state, Slovenia
imposed a hard border Schengen regime with non-member Croatia in
December 2007


Refugees and internally displaced persons:

IDPs: 2,900-7,000 (Croats and Serbs displaced in 1992-95 war) (2007)


Illicit drugs:

Introduction
Cuba



Background:

The native Amerindian population of Cuba began to decline after the
European discovery of the island by Christopher COLUMBUS in 1492 and
following its development as a Spanish colony during the next
several centuries. Large numbers of African slaves were imported to
work the coffee and sugar plantations, and Havana became the
launching point for the annual treasure fleets bound for Spain from
Mexico and Peru. Spanish rule, marked initially by neglect, became
increasingly repressive, provoking an independence movement and
occasional rebellions that were harshly suppressed. It was US
intervention during the Spanish-American War in 1898 that finally
overthrew Spanish rule. The subsequent Treaty of Paris established
Cuban independence, which was granted in 1902 after a three-year
transition period. Fidel CASTRO led a rebel army to victory in 1959;
his iron rule held the subsequent regime together for nearly five
decades. He stepped down as president in February 2008 in favor of
his younger brother Raul CASTRO. Cuba's Communist revolution, with
Soviet support, was exported throughout Latin America and Africa
during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. The country is now slowly
recovering from a severe economic downturn in 1990, following the
withdrawal of former Soviet subsidies, worth $4 billion to $6
billion annually. Cuba portrays its difficulties as the result of
the US embargo in place since 1961. Illicit migration to the US -
using homemade rafts, alien smugglers, air flights, or via the
southwest border - is a continuing problem. The US Coast Guard
intercepted 2,864 individuals attempting to cross the Straits of
Florida in fiscal year 2006.

Economy
Cuba



Economy - overview:

The government continues to balance the need for economic loosening
against a desire for firm political control. It has rolled back
limited reforms undertaken in the 1990s to increase enterprise
efficiency and alleviate serious shortages of food, consumer goods,
and services. The average Cuban's standard of living remains at a
lower level than before the downturn of the 1990s, which was caused
by the loss of Soviet aid and domestic inefficiencies. Since late
2000, Venezuela has been providing oil on preferential terms, and it
currently supplies about 100,000 barrels per day of petroleum
products. Cuba has been paying for the oil, in part, with the
services of Cuban personnel in Venezuela, including some 20,000
medical professionals. In 2007, high metals prices continued to
boost Cuban earnings from nickel and cobalt production. Havana
continued to invest in the country's energy sector to mitigate
electrical blackouts that had plagued the country since 2004.

general assessment: greater investment beginning in 1994 and the
establishment of a new Ministry of Information Technology and
Communications in 2000 has resulted in improvements in the system;
wireless service is expensive and must be paid in convertible pesos
which effectively limits mobile cellular subscribership
domestic: national fiber-optic system under development; 95% of
switches digitized by end of 2006; fixed telephone line density
remains low, at less than 10 per 100 inhabitants; domestic cellular
service expanding but remains at only about 2 per 100 persons
international: country code - 53; fiber-optic cable laid to but not
linked to US network; satellite earth station - 1 Intersputnik
(Atlantic Ocean region) (2007)

Military
Cuba

Revolutionary Armed Forces (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias, FAR):
Revolutionary Army (ER; includes Territorial Militia Troops, MTT),
Revolutionary Navy (Marina de Guerra Revolucionaria, MGR; includes
Marine Corps), Revolutionary Air and Air Defense Force (DAAFAR),
Youth Labor Army (EJT) (2008)


Military service age and obligation:

17-28 years of age for compulsory military service; 2-year service
obligation; both sexes subject to military service (2006)


Manpower available for military service:

males age 16-49: 3,094,388
females age 16-49: 3,024,876 (2008 est.)

Manpower reaching militarily significant age annually:

male: 79,945
female: 76,014 (2008 est.)


Military expenditures:

3.8% of GDP (2006 est.)


Military - note:

the collapse of the Soviet Union deprived the Cuban Army of its
major economic and logistic support, and had a significant impact on
equipment numbers and serviceability; the army remains well trained
and professional in nature; while the lack of replacement parts for
its existing equipment and the current severe shortage of fuel have
increasingly affected operational capabilities, Cuba remains able to
offer considerable resistance to any regional power (2008)


Transnational Issues
Cuba



Disputes - international:

US Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay is leased to US and only mutual
agreement or US abandonment of the facility can terminate the lease


Trafficking in persons:

current situation: Cuba is principally a source country for women
and children trafficked within the country for the purpose of
commercial sexual exploitation and possibly for forced labor; the
country is a destination for sex tourism, including child sex
tourism, which is a problem in many areas of the country; some Cuban
nationals willingly migrate to the United States, but are
subsequently exploited for forced labor by their smugglers; Cuba is
also a transit point for the smuggling of migrants from China, Sri
Lanka, Bangladesh, Lebanon, and other nations to the United States
and Canada
tier rating: Tier 3 - Cuba does not fully comply with the minimum
standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making
significant efforts to do so; exact information about trafficking in
Cuba is difficult to obtain because the government does not
acknowledge or condemn human trafficking as a problem in Cuba;
tangible efforts to prosecute offenders, protect victims, or prevent
human trafficking activity do not appear to have been made during
2007; Cuba has not ratified the 2000 UN TIP Protocol (2008)


Illicit drugs:

territorial waters and air space serve as transshipment zone for US-
and European-bound drugs; established the death penalty for certain
drug-related crimes in 1999

Introduction
Cyprus



Background:

A former British colony, Cyprus became independent in 1960 following
years of resistance to British rule. Tensions between the Greek
Cypriot majority and Turkish Cypriot minority came to a head in
December 1963, when violence broke out in the capital of Nicosia.
Despite the deployment of UN peacekeepers in 1964, sporadic
intercommunal violence continued forcing most Turkish Cypriots into
enclaves throughout the island. In 1974, a Greek
Government-sponsored attempt to seize control of Cyprus was met by
military intervention from Turkey, which soon controlled more than a
third of the island. In 1983, the Turkish-held area declared itself
the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" (TRNC), but it is
recognized only by Turkey. The latest two-year round of UN-brokered
talks - between the leaders of the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot
communities to reach an agreement to reunite the divided island -
ended when the Greek Cypriots rejected the UN settlement plan in an
April 2004 referendum. The entire island entered the EU on 1 May
2004, although the EU acquis - the body of common rights and
obligations - applies only to the areas under direct government

Cypriots. However, individual Turkish Cypriots able to document
their eligibility for Republic of Cyprus citizenship legally enjoy
the same rights accorded to other citizens of European Union states.
The election of a new Cypriot president in 2008 served as the
impetus for the UN to encourage both the Turkish and Cypriot
Governments to reopen unification negotiations.

island began following the outbreak of communal strife in 1963; this
separation was further solidified after the Turkish intervention in
July 1974 that followed a Greek junta-supported coup attempt gave
the Turkish Cypriots de facto control in the north; Greek Cypriots
control the only internationally recognized government; on 15
November 1983 Turkish Cypriot "President" Rauf DENKTASH declared

a new or revised constitution to govern the island and for better
relations between Greek and Turkish Cypriots have been held
intermittently since the mid-1960s; in 1975, following the 1974
Turkish intervention, Turkish Cypriots created their own
constitution and governing bodies within the "Turkish Federated
State of Cyprus," which became the "Turkish Republic of Northern
Cyprus (TRNC)" when the Turkish Cypriots declared their independence

Economy
Cyprus



Economy - overview:

The area of the Republic of Cyprus under government control has a
market economy dominated by the service sector, which accounts for
78% of GDP. Tourism, financial services, and real estate are the
most important sectors. Erratic growth rates over the past decade
reflect the economy's reliance on tourism, which often fluctuates
with political instability in the region and economic conditions in
Western Europe. Nevertheless, the economy in the area under
government control grew by an average of 3.6% per year during the
period of 2000-06, well above the EU average. Cyprus joined the
European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM2) in May 2005 and adopted the
euro as its national currency on 1 January 2008. An aggressive
austerity program in the preceding years, aimed at paving the way
for the euro, helped turn a soaring fiscal deficit (6.3% in 2003)
into a surplus of 1.5% in 2007. As in the area administered by
Turkish Cypriots, water shortages are a perennial problem; a few
desalination plants are now on line. After 10 years of drought, the
country received substantial rainfall from 2001-04 alleviating
immediate concerns. Rainfall in 2005 and 2006, however, was well
below average, making water rationing a necessity in 2007.

Economy of the area administered by Turkish Cypriots:

Economy - overview: The Turkish Cypriot economy has roughly 30% of
the per capita GDP of the south, and economic growth tends to be
volatile, given the north's relative isolation, bloated public
sector, reliance on the Turkish lira, and small market size.
Agriculture and services, together, employ more than half of the
work force. The Turkish Cypriot economy grew around 10.6% in 2006,
fueled by growth in the construction and education sectors, as well
as increased employment of Turkish Cypriots in the area under
government control. GDP declined about 2.0% in 2007. The Turkish
Cypriots are heavily dependent on transfers from the Turkish
Government. Ankara directly finances around one-third of the
"TRNC's" budget. Aid from Turkey has exceeded $400 million annually
in recent years.

Transnational Issues
Cyprus



Disputes - international:

hostilities in 1974 divided the island into two de facto autonomous
entities, the internationally recognized Cypriot Government and a
Turkish-Cypriot community (north Cyprus); the 1,000-strong UN
Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) has served in Cyprus since
1964 and maintains the buffer zone between north and south; on 1 May
2004, Cyprus entered the European Union still divided, with the EU's
body of legislation and standards (acquis communitaire) suspended in
the north; Turkey protests Cypriot Government creating hydrocarbon
blocks and maritime boundary with Lebanon in March 2007


Refugees and internally displaced persons:

IDPs: 210,000 (both Turkish and Greek Cypriots; many displaced for
over 30 years) (2007)


Trafficking in persons:

current situation: Cyprus is primarily a destination country for a
large number of women trafficked from Eastern and Central Europe,
the Philippines, and the Dominican Republic for the purpose of
sexual exploitation; traffickers continued to fraudulently recruit
victims for work as dancers in cabarets and nightclubs on short-term
"artiste" visas, for work in pubs and bars on employment visas, or
for illegal work on tourist or student visas
tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Cyprus is on the Tier 2 Watch List
for a third consecutive year for failure to show evidence of
increasing efforts to combat human trafficking during 2007; although
Cyprus passed a new trafficking law and opened a government
trafficking shelter, these efforts are outweighed by its failure to
show tangible and critically needed progress in the areas of law
enforcement, victim protection, and the prevention of trafficking
(2008)


Illicit drugs:

minor transit point for heroin and hashish via air routes and
container traffic to Europe, especially from Lebanon and Turkey;
some cocaine transits as well; despite a strengthening of
anti-money-laundering legislation, remains vulnerable to money
laundering; reporting of suspicious transactions in offshore sector
remains weak

Introduction
Czech Republic



Background:

Following the First World War, the closely related Czechs and
Slovaks of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire merged to form
Czechoslovakia. During the interwar years, the new country's leaders
were frequently preoccupied with meeting the demands of other ethnic
minorities within the republic, most notably the Sudeten Germans and
the Ruthenians (Ukrainians). After World War II, a truncated
Czechoslovakia fell within the Soviet sphere of influence. In 1968,
an invasion by Warsaw Pact troops ended the efforts of the country's
leaders to liberalize Communist party rule and create "socialism
with a human face." Anti-Soviet demonstrations the following year
ushered in a period of harsh repression. With the collapse of Soviet
authority in 1989, Czechoslovakia regained its freedom through a
peaceful "Velvet Revolution." On 1 January 1993, the country
underwent a "velvet divorce" into its two national components, the
Czech Republic and Slovakia. The Czech Republic joined NATO in 1999
and the European Union in 2004.

Economy
Czech Republic



Economy - overview:

The Czech Republic is one of the most stable and prosperous of the
post-Communist states of Central and Eastern Europe. Growth in
2000-07 was supported by exports to the EU, primarily to Germany,
and a strong recovery of foreign and domestic investment. Domestic
demand is playing an ever more important role in underpinning growth
as the availability of credit cards and mortgages increases. The
current account deficit has declined to around 3.3% of GDP as demand
for automotive and other products from the Czech Republic remains
strong in the European Union. Rising inflation from higher food and
energy prices are a risk to balanced economic growth. Significant
increases in social spending in the run-up to June 2006 elections
prevented, the government from meeting its goal of reducing its
budget deficit to 3% of GDP in 2007. Negotiations on pension and
additional healthcare reforms are continuing without clear prospects
for agreement and implementation. Intensified restructuring among
large enterprises, improvements in the financial sector, and
effective use of available EU funds should strengthen output growth.
The pro-business Civic Democratic Party-led government approved
reforms in 2007 designed to cut spending on some social welfare
benefits and reform the tax system with the aim of eventually
reducing the budget deficit to 2.3% of GDP by 2010. Parliamentary
approval for any additional reforms could prove difficult, however,
because of the parliament's even split. The government withdrew a
2010 target date for euro adoption and instead aims to meet the
eurozone criteria around 2012.

Introduction
Denmark



Background:

Once the seat of Viking raiders and later a major north European
power, Denmark has evolved into a modern, prosperous nation that is
participating in the general political and economic integration of
Europe. It joined NATO in 1949 and the EEC (now the EU) in 1973.
However, the country has opted out of certain elements of the
European Union's Maastricht Treaty, including the European Economic
and Monetary Union (EMU), European defense cooperation, and issues
concerning certain justice and home affairs.

Economy
Denmark



Economy - overview:

The Danish economy has in recent years undergone strong expansion
fueled primarily by private consumption growth, but also supported
by exports and investments. This thoroughly modern market economy
features high-tech agriculture, up-to-date small-scale and corporate
industry, extensive government welfare measures, comfortable living
standards, a stable currency, and high dependence on foreign trade.
Unemployment is low and capacity constraints are limiting growth
potential. Denmark is a net exporter of food and energy and enjoys a
comfortable balance of payments surplus. Government objectives
include streamlining the bureaucracy and further privatization of
state assets. The government has been successful in meeting, and
even exceeding, the economic convergence criteria for participating
in the third phase (a common European currency) of the European
Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), but so far Denmark has decided
not to join 15 other EU members in the euro. Nonetheless, the Danish
krone remains pegged to the euro. Economic growth gained momentum in
2004 and the upturn continued through 2007. The controversy over
caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad printed in a Danish newspaper in
September 2005 led to boycotts of some Danish exports to the Muslim
world, especially exports of dairy products, but the boycotts did
not have a significant impact on the overall Danish economy. Because
of high GDP per capita, welfare benefits, a low Gini index, and
political stability, the Danish living standards are among the
highest in the world. A major long-term issue will be the sharp
decline in the ratio of workers to retirees.

@Djibouti

Introduction
Djibouti



Background:

The French Territory of the Afars and the Issas became Djibouti in
1977. Hassan Gouled APTIDON installed an authoritarian one-party
state and proceeded to serve as president until 1999. Unrest among
the Afars minority during the 1990s led to a civil war that ended in
2001 following the conclusion of a peace accord between Afar rebels
and the Issa-dominated government. In 1999, Djibouti's first
multi-party presidential elections resulted in the election of
Ismail Omar GUELLEH; he was re-elected to a second and final term in
2005. Djibouti occupies a strategic geographic location at the mouth
of the Red Sea and serves as an important transshipment location for
goods entering and leaving the east African highlands. The present
leadership favors close ties to France, which maintains a
significant military presence in the country, but also has strong
ties with the US. Djibouti hosts the only US military base in
sub-Saharan Africa and is a front-line state in the global war on
terrorism.

Economy
Djibouti



Economy - overview:

The economy is based on service activities connected with the
country's strategic location and status as a free trade zone in the
Horn of Africa. Two-thirds of Djibouti's inhabitants live in the
capital city; the remainder are mostly nomadic herders. Scanty
rainfall limits crop production to fruits and vegetables, and most
food must be imported. Djibouti provides services as both a transit
port for the region and an international transshipment and refueling
center. Imports and exports from landlocked neighbor Ethiopia
represent 85% of port activity at Djibouti's container terminal.
Djibouti has few natural resources and little industry. The nation
is, therefore, heavily dependent on foreign assistance to help
support its balance of payments and to finance development projects.
An unemployment rate of nearly 60% continues to be a major problem.
While inflation is not a concern, due to the fixed tie of the
Djiboutian franc to the US dollar, the artificially high value of
the Djiboutian franc adversely affects Djibouti's balance of
payments. Per capita consumption dropped an estimated 35% between
1999 and 2006 because of recession, civil war, and a high population
growth rate (including immigrants and refugees). Faced with a
multitude of economic difficulties, the government has fallen in
arrears on long-term external debt and has been struggling to meet
the stipulations of foreign aid donors.

Introduction
Dominica



Background:

Dominica was the last of the Caribbean islands to be colonized by
Europeans due chiefly to the fierce resistance of the native Caribs.
France ceded possession to Great Britain in 1763, which made the
island a colony in 1805. In 1980, two years after independence,
Dominica's fortunes improved when a corrupt and tyrannical
administration was replaced by that of Mary Eugenia CHARLES, the
first female prime minister in the Caribbean, who remained in office
for 15 years. Some 3,000 Carib Indians still living on Dominica are
the only pre-Columbian population remaining in the eastern Caribbean.

Economy
Dominica



Economy - overview:

The Dominican economy depends on agriculture, primarily bananas, and
remains highly vulnerable to climatic conditions and international
economic developments. Tourism has increased as the government seeks
to promote Dominica as an "ecotourism" destination. In 2003, the
government began a comprehensive restructuring of the economy -
including elimination of price controls, privatization of the state
banana company, and tax increases - to address Dominica's economic
and financial crisis of 2001-02 and to meet IMF targets. This
restructuring paved the way for the current economic recovery - real
growth for 2006 reached a two-decade high - and will help to reduce
the debt burden, which remains at about 100% of GDP. In order to
diversify the island's production base, the government is attempting
to develop an offshore financial sector and is researching
Dominica's capability to export geothermal energy.

Disputes - international:

Dominica is the only Caribbean state to challenge Venezuela's
sovereignty claim over Aves Island and joins the other island
nations in challenging whether the feature sustains human
habitation, a criterion under the UN Convention on the Law of the
Sea (UNCLOS), which permits Venezuela to extend its Exclusive
Economic Zone (EEZ) and continental shelf claims over a large
portion of the eastern Caribbean Sea


Illicit drugs:

transshipment point for narcotics bound for the US and Europe; minor
cannabis producer; anti-money-laundering enforcement is weak, making
the country particularly vulnerable to money laundering

@Dominican Republic

Introduction
Dominican Republic



Background:

Explored and claimed by Christopher COLUMBUS on his first voyage in
1492, the island of Hispaniola became a springboard for Spanish
conquest of the Caribbean and the American mainland. In 1697, Spain
recognized French dominion over the western third of the island,
which in 1804 became Haiti. The remainder of the island, by then
known as Santo Domingo, sought to gain its own independence in 1821,
but was conquered and ruled by the Haitians for 22 years; it finally
attained independence as the Dominican Republic in 1844. In 1861,
the Dominicans voluntarily returned to the Spanish Empire, but two
years later they launched a war that restored independence in 1865.
A legacy of unsettled, mostly non-representative rule followed,
capped by the dictatorship of Rafael Leonidas TRUJILLO from 1930-61.
Juan BOSCH was elected president in 1962, but was deposed in a
military coup in 1963. In 1965, the United States led an
intervention in the midst of a civil war sparked by an uprising to
restore BOSCH. In 1966, Joaquin BALAGUER defeated BOSCH in an
election to become president. BALAGUER maintained a tight grip on
power for most of the next 30 years when international reaction to
flawed elections forced him to curtail his term in 1996. Since then,
regular competitive elections have been held in which opposition
candidates have won the presidency. Former President (1996-2000)
Leonel FERNANDEZ Reyna won election to a second term in 2004
following a constitutional amendment allowing presidents to serve
more than one term.

Economy
Dominican Republic



Economy - overview:

The Dominican Republic has enjoyed strong GDP growth since 2005,
with double digit growth in 2006. In 2007, exports were bolstered by
the nearly 50% increase in nickel prices; however, prices are
expected to fall in 2008, contributing to a slowdown in GDP growth
for the year. Although the country has long been viewed primarily as
an exporter of sugar, coffee, and tobacco, in recent years the
service sector has overtaken agriculture as the economy's largest
employer due to growth in tourism and free trade zones. The economy
is highly dependent upon the US, the source of nearly three-fourths
of exports, and remittances represent about a tenth of GDP,
equivalent to almost half of exports and three-quarters of tourism
receipts. With the help of strict fiscal targets agreed to in the
2004 renegotiation of an IMF standby loan, President FERNANDEZ has
stabilized the country's financial situation, lowering inflation to
less than 6%. A fiscal expansion is expected for 2008 prior to the
elections in May and for Tropical Storm Noel reconstruction.
Although the economy is growing at a respectable rate, high
unemployment and underemployment remains an important challenge. The
country suffers from marked income inequality; the poorest half of
the population receives less than one-fifth of GNP, while the
richest 10% enjoys nearly 40% of national income. The Central
America-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) came into
force in March 2007, which should boost investment and exports and
reduce losses to the Asian garment industry.

@Ecuador

Introduction
Ecuador



Background:

What is now Ecuador formed part of the northern Inca Empire until
the Spanish conquest in 1533. Quito became a seat of Spanish
colonial government in 1563 and part of the Viceroyalty of New
Granada in 1717. The territories of the Viceroyalty - New Granada
(Colombia), Venezuela, and Quito - gained their independence between
1819 and 1822 and formed a federation known as Gran Colombia. When
Quito withdrew in 1830, the traditional name was changed in favor of
the "Republic of the Equator." Between 1904 and 1942, Ecuador lost
territories in a series of conflicts with its neighbors. A border
war with Peru that flared in 1995 was resolved in 1999. Although
Ecuador marked 25 years of civilian governance in 2004, the period
has been marred by political instability. Protests in Quito have
contributed to the mid-term ouster of Ecuador's last three
democratically elected Presidents. In 2007, a Constituent Assembly
was elected to draft a new constitution; Ecuador's twentieth since
gaining independence.

Economy
Ecuador



Economy - overview:

Ecuador is substantially dependent on its petroleum resources, which
have accounted for more than half of the country's export earnings
and one-fourth of public sector revenues in recent years. In
1999/2000, Ecuador suffered a severe economic crisis, with GDP
contracted by more than 6%, with a significant increase in poverty.
The banking system also collapsed, and Ecuador defaulted on its
external debt later that year. In March 2000, Congress approved a
series of structural reforms that also provided for the adoption of
the US dollar as legal tender. Dollarization stabilized the economy,
and positive growth returned in the years that followed, helped by
high oil prices, remittances, and increased non-traditional exports.
From 2002-06 the economy grew 5.5%, the highest five-year average in
25 years. The poverty rate declined but remained high at 38% in
2006. In 2006 the government of Alfredo PALACIO (2005-07) seized the
assets of Occidental Petroleum for alleged contract violations and
imposed a windfall revenue tax on foreign oil companies, leading to
the suspension of free trade negotiations with the US. These
measures, combined with chronic underinvestment in the state oil
company, Petroecuador, led to a drop in petroleum production in
2007. PALACIO's successor, Rafael CORREA, raised the specter of debt
default - but Ecuador has paid its debt on time. He also decreed a
higher windfall revenue tax on private oil companies, then sought to
renegotiate their contracts to overcome the debilitating effect of
the tax. This generated economic uncertainty; private investment has
dropped and economic growth has slowed significantly.

@Egypt

Introduction
Egypt



Background:

The regularity and richness of the annual Nile River flood, coupled
with semi-isolation provided by deserts to the east and west,
allowed for the development of one of the world's great
civilizations. A unified kingdom arose circa 3200 B.C., and a series
of dynasties ruled in Egypt for the next three millennia. The last
native dynasty fell to the Persians in 341 B.C., who in turn were
replaced by the Greeks, Romans, and Byzantines. It was the Arabs who
introduced Islam and the Arabic language in the 7th century and who
ruled for the next six centuries. A local military caste, the
Mamluks took control about 1250 and continued to govern after the
conquest of Egypt by the Ottoman Turks in 1517. Following the
completion of the Suez Canal in 1869, Egypt became an important
world transportation hub, but also fell heavily into debt.
Ostensibly to protect its investments, Britain seized control of
Egypt's government in 1882, but nominal allegiance to the Ottoman
Empire continued until 1914. Partially independent from the UK in
1922, Egypt acquired full sovereignty with the overthrow of the
British-backed monarchy in 1952. The completion of the Aswan High
Dam in 1971 and the resultant Lake Nasser have altered the
time-honored place of the Nile River in the agriculture and ecology
of Egypt. A rapidly growing population (the largest in the Arab
world), limited arable land, and dependence on the Nile all continue
to overtax resources and stress society. The government has
struggled to meet the demands of Egypt's growing population through
economic reform and massive investment in communications and
physical infrastructure.

Economy
Egypt



Economy - overview:

Occupying the northeast corner of the African continent, Egypt is
bisected by the highly fertile Nile valley, where most economic
activity takes place. In the last 30 years, the government has
reformed the highly centralized economy it inherited from President
Gamel Abdel NASSER. In 2005, Prime Minister Ahmed NAZIF's government
reduced personal and corporate tax rates, reduced energy subsidies,
and privatized several enterprises. The stock market boomed, and GDP
grew about 5% per year in 2005-06, and topped 7% in 2007. Despite
these achievements, the government has failed to raise living
standards for the average Egyptian, and has had to continue
providing subsidies for basic necessities. The subsidies have
contributed to a sizeable budget deficit - roughly 7.5% of GDP in
2007 - and represent a significant drain on the economy. Foreign
direct investment has increased significantly in the past two years,
but the NAZIF government will need to continue its aggressive
pursuit of reforms in order to sustain the spike in investment and
growth and begin to improve economic conditions for the broader
population. Egypt's export sectors - particularly natural gas - have
bright prospects.

administration of the Bir Tawil trapezoid in Sudan on its maps;
Gazan breaches in the security wall with Egypt in January 2008
highlight difficulties in monitoring the Sinai border


Refugees and internally displaced persons:

refugees (country of origin): 60,000 - 80,000 (Iraq); 70,198
(Palestinian Territories); 12,157 (Sudan) (2007)


Trafficking in persons:

current situation: Egypt is a transit country for women trafficked
from Eastern European countries to Israel for sexual exploitation,
and is a source for children trafficked within the country for
commercial sexual exploitation and domestic servitude, although the
extent to which children are trafficked internally is unknown;
children were also recruited for domestic and agricultural work;
some of these children face conditions of involuntary servitude,
such as restrictions on movement, non-payment of wages, threats, and
physical or sexual abuse
tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Egypt is on the Tier 2 Watch List
for the third year in a row because it did not provide evidence of
increasing efforts to investigate and prosecute traffickers;
however, in July 2007, the government established the "National
Coordinating Committee to Combat and Prevent Trafficking in
Persons," which improved inter-governmental coordination on
anti-trafficking initiatives; Egypt made no discernible efforts to
punish trafficking crimes in 2007 and the Egyptian penal code does
not prohibit all forms of trafficking; Egypt did not increase its
services to trafficking victims during the reporting period (2008)


Illicit drugs:

transit point for cannabis, heroin, and opium moving to Europe,
Israel, and North Africa; transit stop for Nigerian drug couriers;
concern as money laundering site due to lax enforcement of financial
regulations

Economy
El Salvador



Economy - overview:

The smallest country in Central America, El Salvador has the third
largest economy, but growth has been modest in recent years. Robust
growth in non-traditional exports have offset declines in the
maquila exports, while remittances and external aid offset the trade
deficit from high oil prices and strong import demand for consumer
and intermediate goods. El Salvador leads the region in remittances
per capita with inflows equivalent to nearly all export income.
Implementation in 2006 of the Central America-Dominican Republic
Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), which El Salvador was the first to
ratify, has strengthened an already positive export trend. With the
adoption of the US dollar as its currency in 2001, El Salvador lost
control over monetary policy and must concentrate on maintaining a
disciplined fiscal policy. The current government has pursued
economic diversification, with some success in promoting textile
production, international port services, and tourism through tax
incentives. It is committed to opening the economy to trade and
investment, and has embarked on a wave of privatizations extending
to telecom, electricity distribution, banking, and pension funds. In
late 2006, the government and the Millennium Challenge Corporation
signed a five-year, $461 million compact to stimulate economic
growth and reduce poverty in the country's northern region through
investments in education, public services, enterprise development,
and transportation infrastructure.

Introduction
Equatorial Guinea



Background:

Equatorial Guinea gained independence in 1968 after 190 years of
Spanish rule. This tiny country, composed of a mainland portion plus
five inhabited islands, is one of the smallest on the African
continent. President Teodoro OBIANG NGUEMA MBASOGO has ruled the
country since 1979 when he seized power in a coup. Although
nominally a constitutional democracy since 1991, the 1996 and 2002
presidential elections - as well as the 1999 and 2004 legislative
elections - were widely seen as flawed. The president exerts almost
total control over the political system and has discouraged
political opposition. Equatorial Guinea has experienced rapid
economic growth due to the discovery of large offshore oil reserves,
and in the last decade has become Sub-Saharan Africa's third largest
oil exporter. Despite the country's economic windfall from oil
production resulting in a massive increase in government revenue in
recent years, there have been few improvements in the population's
living standards.

Economy
Equatorial Guinea



Economy - overview:

The discovery and exploitation of large oil reserves have
contributed to dramatic economic growth in recent years. Forestry,
farming, and fishing are also major components of GDP. Subsistence
farming predominates. Although pre-independence Equatorial Guinea
counted on cocoa production for hard currency earnings, the neglect
of the rural economy under successive regimes has diminished
potential for agriculture-led growth (the government has stated its
intention to reinvest some oil revenue into agriculture). A number
of aid programs sponsored by the World Bank and the IMF have been
cut off since 1993, because of corruption and mismanagement. No
longer eligible for concessional financing because of large oil
revenues, the government has been trying to agree on a "shadow"
fiscal management program with the World Bank and IMF. Government
officials and their family members own most businesses. Undeveloped
natural resources include titanium, iron ore, manganese, uranium,
and alluvial gold. Growth remained strong in 2007, led by oil.

Transnational Issues
Equatorial Guinea



Disputes - international:

in 2002, ICJ ruled on an equidistance settlement of
Cameroon-Equatorial Guinea-Nigeria maritime boundary in the Gulf of
Guinea, but a dispute between Equatorial Guinea and Cameroon over an
island at the mouth of the Ntem River and imprecisely defined
maritime coordinates in the ICJ decision delay final delimitation;
UN urges Equatorial Guinea and Gabon to resolve the sovereignty
dispute over Gabon-occupied Mbane and lesser islands and to create a
maritime boundary in the hydrocarbon-rich Corisco Bay


Trafficking in persons:

current situation: Equatorial Guinea is primarily a destination
country for children trafficked for the purpose of forced labor and
possibly for the purpose of sexual exploitation; children have been
trafficked from nearby countries for domestic servitude, market
labor, ambulant vending, and possibly sexual exploitation; women may
also be trafficked to Equatorial Guinea from Cameroon, Benin, other
neighboring countries, and China for sexual exploitation
tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Equatorial Guinea is on the Tier 2
Watch List for its failure to provide evidence of increasing efforts
to eliminate trafficking, particularly in the areas of prosecuting
and convicting trafficking offenders and failing to formalize
mechanisms to provide assistance to victims; although the government
made some effort to enforce laws against child labor exploitation,
it failed to report any trafficking prosecutions or convictions in
2007; the government continued to lack shelters or formal procedures
for providing care to victims (2008)

@Eritrea

Introduction
Eritrea



Background:

Eritrea was awarded to Ethiopia in 1952 as part of a federation.
Ethiopia's annexation of Eritrea as a province 10 years later
sparked a 30-year struggle for independence that ended in 1991 with
Eritrean rebels defeating governmental forces; independence was
overwhelmingly approved in a 1993 referendum. A two-and-a-half-year
border war with Ethiopia that erupted in 1998 ended under UN
auspices in December 2000. Eritrea currently hosts a UN peacekeeping
operation that is monitoring a 25 km-wide Temporary Security Zone
(TSZ) on the border with Ethiopia. An international commission,
organized to resolve the border dispute, posted its findings in
2002. However, both parties have been unable to reach agreement on
implementing the decision. On 30 November 2007, the Eritrea-Ethiopia
Boundary Commission remotely demarcated the border by coordinates
and dissolved itself, leaving Ethiopia still occupying several
tracts of disputed territory, including the town of Badme. Eritrea
accepted the EEBC's "virtual demarcation" decision and called on
Ethiopia to remove its troops from the TSZ which it states is
Eritrean territory. Ethiopia has not accepted the virtual
demarcation decision.

Economy
Eritrea



Economy - overview:

Since independence from Ethiopia in 1993, Eritrea has faced the
economic problems of a small, desperately poor country, accentuated
by the recent implementation of restrictive economic policies.
Eritrea has a command economy under the control of the sole
political party, the People's Front for Democracy and Justice
(PFDJ). Like the economies of many African nations, the economy is
largely based on subsistence agriculture, with 80% of the population
involved in farming and herding. The Ethiopian-Eritrea war in
1998-2000 severely hurt Eritrea's economy. GDP growth fell to zero
in 1999 and to -12.1% in 2000. The May 2000 Ethiopian offensive into
northern Eritrea caused some $600 million in property damage and
loss, including losses of $225 million in livestock and 55,000
homes. The attack prevented planting of crops in Eritrea's most
productive region, causing food production to drop by 62%. Even
during the war, Eritrea developed its transportation infrastructure,
asphalting new roads, improving its ports, and repairing war-damaged
roads and bridges. Since the war ended, the government has
maintained a firm grip on the economy, expanding the use of the
military and party-owned businesses to complete Eritrea's
development agenda. The government strictly controls the use of
foreign currency, limiting access and availability. Few private
enterprises remain in Eritrea. Eritrea's economy is heavily
dependent on taxes paid by members of the diaspora. Erratic rainfall
and the delayed demobilization of agriculturalists from the military
continue to interfere with agricultural production, and Eritrea's
recent harvests have not been able to meet the food needs of the
country. The government continues to place its hope for additional
revenue on the development of several international mining projects.
Despite difficulties for international companies in working with the
Eritrean government, a Canadian mining company signed a contract
with the GSE in 2007 and plans to begin mineral extraction in 2010.
Eritrea also anticipates opening a free trade zone at the port of
Massawa in 2008. Eritrea's economic future depends upon its ability
to master social problems such as illiteracy, unemployment, and low
skills, and more importantly, on the government's willingness to
support a true market economy.

Introduction
Estonia



Background:

After centuries of Danish, Swedish, German, and Russian rule,
Estonia attained independence in 1918. Forcibly incorporated into
the USSR in 1940 - an action never recognized by the US - it
regained its freedom in 1991, with the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Since the last Russian troops left in 1994, Estonia has been free to
promote economic and political ties with Western Europe. It joined
both NATO and the EU in the spring of 2004.

Economy
Estonia



Economy - overview:

Estonia, a 2004 European Union entrant, has a modern market-based
economy and one of the highest per capita income levels in Central
Europe. The economy benefits from strong electronics and
telecommunications sectors and strong trade ties with Finland,
Sweden, and Germany. The current government has pursued relatively
sound fiscal policies, resulting in balanced budgets and low public
debt. In 2007, however, a large current account deficit and rising
inflation put pressure on Estonia's currency, which is pegged to the
euro, highlighting the need for growth in export-generating
industries.

continue to press for realignment of the boundary based on the 1920
Tartu Peace Treaty that would bring the now divided ethnic Setu
people and parts of the Narva region within Estonia; as a member
state that forms part of the EU's external border, Estonia must
implement the strict Schengen border rules with Russia


Illicit drugs:

growing producer of synthetic drugs; increasingly important
transshipment zone for cannabis, cocaine, opiates, and synthetic
drugs since joining the European Union and the Schengen Accord;
potential money laundering related to organized crime and drug

to launder funds; major use of opiates and ecstasy

Introduction
Ethiopia



Background:

Unique among African countries, the ancient Ethiopian monarchy
maintained its freedom from colonial rule with the exception of the
1936-41 Italian occupation during World War II. In 1974, a military
junta, the Derg, deposed Emperor Haile SELASSIE (who had ruled since
1930) and established a socialist state. Torn by bloody coups,
uprisings, wide-scale drought, and massive refugee problems, the
regime was finally toppled in 1991 by a coalition of rebel forces,
the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). A
constitution was adopted in 1994, and Ethiopia's first multiparty
elections were held in 1995. A border war with Eritrea late in the
1990s ended with a peace treaty in December 2000. The
Eritrea-Ethiopia Border Commission in November 2007 remotely
demarcated the border by geographical coordinates, but final
demarcation of the boundary on the ground is currently on hold
because of Ethiopian objections to an international commission's
finding requiring it to surrender territory considered sensitive to
Ethiopia.

Economy
Ethiopia



Economy - overview:

Ethiopia's poverty-stricken economy is based on agriculture,
accounting for almost half of GDP, 60% of exports, and 80% of total
employment. The agricultural sector suffers from frequent drought
and poor cultivation practices. Coffee is critical to the Ethiopian
economy with exports of some $350 million in 2006, but historically
low prices have seen many farmers switching to qat to supplement
income. The war with Eritrea in 1998-2000 and recurrent drought have
buffeted the economy, in particular coffee production. In November
2001, Ethiopia qualified for debt relief from the Highly Indebted
Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, and in December 2005 the IMF voted
to forgive Ethiopia's debt to the body. Under Ethiopia's
constitution, the state owns all land and provides long-term leases
to the tenants; the system continues to hamper growth in the
industrial sector as entrepreneurs are unable to use land as
collateral for loans. Drought struck again late in 2002, leading to
a 3.3% decline in GDP in 2003. Normal weather patterns helped
agricultural and GDP growth recover during 2004-07.

EEBC Demarcation Statement; UN Peacekeeping Mission to Ethiopia and
Eritrea (UNMEE), which has monitored the 25-km-wide Temporary
Security Zone in Eritrea since 2000, is extended for six months in
2007 despite Eritrean restrictions on its operations and reduced
force of 17,000; the undemarcated former British administrative line
has little meaning as a political separation to rival clans within
Ethiopia's Ogaden and southern Somalia's Oromo region; Ethiopian
forces invaded southern Somalia and routed Islamist Courts from
Mogadishu in January 2007; "Somaliland" secessionists provide port
facilities in Berbera and trade ties to landlocked Ethiopia; civil
unrest in eastern Sudan has hampered efforts to demarcate the porous
boundary with Ethiopia

13,078 (Eritrea)
IDPs: 200,000 (border war with Eritrea from 1998-2000, ethnic
clashes in Gambela, and ongoing Ethiopian military counterinsurgency
in Somali region; most IDPs are in Tigray and Gambela Provinces)
(2007)


Illicit drugs:

transit hub for heroin originating in Southwest and Southeast Asia
and destined for Europe, as well as cocaine destined for markets in
southern Africa; cultivates qat (khat) for local use and regional
export, principally to Djibouti and Somalia (legal in all three
countries); the lack of a well-developed financial system limits the
country's utility as a money laundering center

Introduction
European Union



Preliminary statement:

The evolution of the European Union (EU) from a regional economic
agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's
supranational organization of 27 countries across the European
continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of
history. Dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the
norm in Europe. On a few occasions even country-level unions were
arranged - the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the
Austro-Hungarian Empire were examples - but for such a large number
of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching
entity is truly unique.
Although the EU is not a federation in the strict sense, it is far
more than a free-trade association such as ASEAN, NAFTA, or
Mercosur, and it has many of the attributes associated with
independent nations: its own flag, anthem, founding date, and
currency, as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy
in its dealings with other nations.
In the future, many of these nation-like characteristics are likely
to be expanded. Thus, inclusion of basic intelligence on the EU has
been deemed appropriate as a new, separate entity in The World
Factbook. However, because of the EU's special status, this
description is placed after the regular country entries.


Background:

Following the two devastating World Wars of the first half of the
20th century, a number of European leaders in the late 1940s became
convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to
unite the two chief belligerent nations - France and Germany - both
economically and politically. In 1950, the French Foreign Minister
Robert SCHUMAN proposed an eventual union of all Europe, the first
step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel
industries of Western Europe. The following year the European Coal
and Steel Community (ECSC) was set up when six members, Belgium,
France, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, signed
the Treaty of Paris.
The ECSC was so successful that within a few years the decision was
made to integrate other parts of the countries' economies. In 1957,
the Treaties of Rome created the European Economic Community (EEC)
and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom), and the six
member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves
by forming a common market. In 1967, the institutions of all three
communities were formally merged into the European Community (EC),
creating a single Commission, a single Council of Ministers, and the
European Parliament. Members of the European Parliament were
initially selected by national parliaments, but in 1979 the first
direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five
years since.
In 1973, the first enlargement of the EC took place with the
addition of Denmark, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. The 1980s saw
further membership expansion with Greece joining in 1981 and Spain
and Portugal in 1986. The 1992 Treaty of Maastricht laid the basis
for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy, in
judicial and internal affairs, and in the creation of an economic
and monetary union - including a common currency. This further
integration created the European Union (EU). In 1995, Austria,
Finland, and Sweden joined the EU, raising the membership total to
15.
A new currency, the euro, was launched in world money markets on 1
January 1999; it became the unit of exchange for all of the EU
states except the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Denmark. In 2002,
citizens of the 12 euro-area countries began using the euro
banknotes and coins. Ten new countries joined the EU in 2004 -
Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania,
Malta, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia - and in 2007 Bulgaria and
Romania joined, bringing the current membership to 27. In order to
ensure that the EU can continue to function efficiently with an
expanded membership, the Treaty of Nice (in force as of 1 February
2003) set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of EU
institutions. An effort to establish an EU constitution, begun in
October 2004, failed to attain unanimous ratification. A new effort,
undertaken in June 2007, calls for the creation of an
Intergovernmental Conference to form a political agreement, known as
the Reform Treaty, which is to serve as a constitution. Unlike the
constitution, however, the Reform Treaty would amend existing
treaties rather than replace them.

referenda in May-June 2005 dealt a severe setback to the
ratification process; in June 2007, the European Council agreed on a
clear and concise mandate for an Intergovernmental Conference to
form a political agreement and put it into legal form; this

Economy
European Union



Economy - overview:

Internally, the EU is attempting to lower trade barriers, adopt a
common currency, and move toward convergence of living standards.
Internationally, the EU aims to bolster Europe's trade position and
its political and economic power. Because of the great differences
in per capita income among member states (from $7,000 to $69,000)
and historic national animosities, the EU faces difficulties in
devising and enforcing common policies. For example, since 2003
Germany and France have flouted the member states' treaty obligation
to prevent their national budgets from running more than a 3%
deficit. In 2004 and 2007, the EU admitted 10 and two countries,
respectively, that are, in general, less advanced technologically
and economically than the other 15. Eleven established EU member
states introduced the euro as their common currency on 1 January
1999 (Greece did so two years later), but the UK, Sweden, and
Denmark chose not to participate. Of the 12 most recent member
states, only Slovenia (1 January 2007) and Cyprus and Malta (1
January 2008) have adopted the euro; the remaining nine are legally
required to adopt the currency upon meeting EU's fiscal and monetary
convergence criteria.

consisting of 22 EU member states that have signed the convention
implementing the Schengen agreements or "acquis" (1985 and 1990) on
the free movement of persons and the harmonization of border
controls in Europe; these agreements became incorporated into EU law
with the implementation of the 1997 Treaty of Amsterdam on 1 May
1999; in addition, non-EU states Iceland and Norway (as part of the
Nordic Union) have been included in the Schengen area since 1996
(full members in 2001), and Switzerland since 2008 bringing the
total current membership to 25; the UK (since 2000) and Ireland
(since 2002) take part in only some aspects of the Schengen area,
especially with respect to police and criminal matters; nine of the
12 new member states that joined the EU since 2004 joined Schengen
on 21 December 2007; of the three remaining EU states, Cyprus is
expected to join by 2009, while Romania and Bulgaria continue to
enhance their border security systems

@Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas)

Introduction
Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas)



Background:

Although first sighted by an English navigator in 1592, the first
landing (English) did not occur until almost a century later in
1690, and the first settlement (French) was not established until
1764. The colony was turned over to Spain two years later and the
islands have since been the subject of a territorial dispute, first
between Britain and Spain, then between Britain and Argentina. The
UK asserted its claim to the islands by establishing a naval
garrison there in 1833. Argentina invaded the islands on 2 April
1982. The British responded with an expeditionary force that landed
seven weeks later and after fierce fighting forced an Argentine
surrender on 14 June 1982.

Economy
Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas)



Economy - overview:

The economy was formerly based on agriculture, mainly sheep farming,
but today fishing contributes the bulk of economic activity. In
1987, the government began selling fishing licenses to foreign
trawlers operating within the Falkland Islands' exclusive fishing
zone. These license fees total more than $40 million per year, which
help support the island's health, education, and welfare system.
Squid accounts for 75% of the fish taken. Dairy farming supports
domestic consumption; crops furnish winter fodder. Exports feature
shipments of high-grade wool to the UK and the sale of postage
stamps and coins. The islands are now self-financing except for
defense. The British Geological Survey announced a 200-mile oil
exploration zone around the islands in 1993, and early seismic
surveys suggest substantial reserves capable of producing 500,000
barrels per day; to date, no exploitable site has been identified.
An agreement between Argentina and the UK in 1995 seeks to defuse
licensing and sovereignty conflicts that would dampen foreign
interest in exploiting potential oil reserves. Tourism, especially
eco-tourism, is increasing rapidly, with about 30,000 visitors in
2001. Another large source of income is interest paid on money the
government has in the bank. The British military presence also
provides a sizeable economic boost.

Economy
Faroe Islands



Economy - overview:

The Faroese economy is dependent on fishing, which makes the economy
vulnerable to price swings. Since 2003 the Faroese economy has
picked up as a result of higher prices for fish and for housing.
Unemployment is minimal and government finances are relatively
sound. Oil finds close to the Islands give hope for economically
recoverable deposits, which could eventually lay the basis for a
more diversified economy and lessen dependence on Danish economic
assistance. Aided by a substantial annual subsidy (about 15% of GDP)
from Denmark, the Faroese have a standard of living not far below
the Danes and other Scandinavians.

Introduction
Fiji



Background:

Fiji became independent in 1970, after nearly a century as a British
colony. Democratic rule was interrupted by two military coups in
1987, caused by concern over a government perceived as dominated by
the Indian community (descendants of contract laborers brought to
the islands by the British in the 19th century). The coups and a
1990 constitution that cemented native Melanesian control of Fiji,
led to heavy Indian emigration; the population loss resulted in
economic difficulties, but ensured that Melanesians became the
majority. A new constitution enacted in 1997 was more equitable.
Free and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted in a government led by
an Indo-Fijian, but a civilian-led coup in May 2000 ushered in a
prolonged period of political turmoil. Parliamentary elections held
in August 2001 provided Fiji with a democratically elected
government led by Prime Minister Laisenia QARASE. Re-elected in May
2006, QARASE was ousted in a December 2006 military coup led by
Commodore Voreqe BAINIMARAMA, who initially appointed himself acting
president. In January 2007, BAINIMARAMA was appointed interim prime
minister.

Economy
Fiji



Economy - overview:

Fiji, endowed with forest, mineral, and fish resources, is one of
the most developed of the Pacific island economies, though still
with a large subsistence sector. Sugar exports, remittances from
Fijians working abroad, and a growing tourist industry - with
400,000 to 500,000 tourists annually - are the major sources of
foreign exchange. Fiji's sugar has special access to European Union
markets, but will be harmed by the EU's decision to cut sugar
subsidies. Sugar processing makes up one-third of industrial
activity but is not efficient. Fiji's tourism industry was damaged
by the December 2006 coup and is facing an uncertain recovery time.
The coup has created a difficult business climate. Tourist arrivals
for 2007 are estimated to be down almost 6%, with substantial job
losses in the service sector. In July 2007 the Reserve Bank of Fiji
announced the economy was expected to contract by 3.1% in 2007.
Fiji's current account deficit reached 23% of GDP in 2006. The EU
has suspended all aid until the interim government takes steps
toward new elections. Long-term problems include low investment,
uncertain land ownership rights, and the government's inability to
manage its budget. Overseas remittances from Fijians working in
Kuwait and Iraq have decreased significantly.

Introduction
Finland



Background:

Finland was a province and then a grand duchy under Sweden from the
12th to the 19th centuries, and an autonomous grand duchy of Russia
after 1809. It won its complete independence in 1917. During World
War II, it was able to successfully defend its freedom and resist
invasions by the Soviet Union - albeit with some loss of territory.
In the subsequent half century, the Finns made a remarkable
transformation from a farm/forest economy to a diversified modern
industrial economy; per capita income is now among the highest in
Western Europe. A member of the European Union since 1995, Finland
was the only Nordic state to join the euro system at its initiation
in January 1999.

Economy
Finland



Economy - overview:

Finland has a highly industrialized, largely free-market economy
with per capita output roughly that of the UK, France, Germany, and
Italy. Its key economic sector is manufacturing - principally the
wood, metals, engineering, telecommunications, and electronics
industries. Trade is important; exports equal nearly two-fifths of
GDP. Finland excels in high-tech exports, e.g., mobile phones.
Except for timber and several minerals, Finland depends on imports
of raw materials, energy, and some components for manufactured
goods. Because of the climate, agricultural development is limited
to maintaining self-sufficiency in basic products. Forestry, an
important export earner, provides a secondary occupation for the
rural population. High unemployment remains a persistent problem. In
2007 Russia announced plans to impose high tariffs on raw timber
exported to Finland. The Finnish pulp and paper industry will be
threatened if these duties are put into place in 2008 and 2009, and
the matter is now being handled by the European Union.

dominant nation-state. Nevertheless, France today is one of the most
modern countries in the world and is a leader among European
nations. Since 1958, it has constructed a hybrid
presidential-parliamentary governing system resistant to the
instabilities experienced in earlier more purely parliamentary
administrations. In recent years, its reconciliation and cooperation
with Germany have proved central to the economic integration of
Europe, including the introduction of a common exchange currency,
the euro, in January 1999. At present, France is at the forefront of
efforts to develop the EU's military capabilities to supplement
progress toward an EU foreign policy.

Economy
France



Economy - overview:

France is in the midst of transition from a well-to-do modern
economy that has featured extensive government ownership and
intervention to one that relies more on market mechanisms. The
government has partially or fully privatized many large companies,
banks, and insurers, and has ceded stakes in such leading firms as
Air France, France Telecom, Renault, and Thales. It maintains a
strong presence in some sectors, particularly power, public
transport, and defense industries. The telecommunications sector is
gradually being opened to competition. France's leaders remain
committed to a capitalism in which they maintain social equity by
means of laws, tax policies, and social spending that reduce income
disparity and the impact of free markets on public health and
welfare. Widespread opposition to labor reform has in recent years
hampered the government's ability to revitalize the economy. In
2007, the government launched divisive labor reform efforts that
will continue into 2008. France's tax burden remains one of the
highest in Europe (nearly 50% of GDP in 2005). France brought the
budget deficit within the eurozone's 3%-of-GDP limit for the first
time in 2007 and has reduced unemployment to roughly 8%. With at
least 75 million foreign tourists per year, France is the most
visited country in the world and maintains the third largest income
in the world from tourism.

Introduction
French Polynesia



Background:

The French annexed various Polynesian island groups during the 19th
century. In September 1995, France stirred up widespread protests by
resuming nuclear testing on the Mururoa atoll after a three-year
moratorium. The tests were suspended in January 1996. In recent
years, French Polynesia's autonomy has been considerably expanded.

Economy
French Polynesia



Economy - overview:

Since 1962, when France stationed military personnel in the region,
French Polynesia has changed from a subsistence agricultural economy
to one in which a high proportion of the work force is either
employed by the military or supports the tourist industry. With the
halt of French nuclear testing in 1996, the military contribution to
the economy fell sharply. Tourism accounts for about one-fourth of
GDP and is a primary source of hard currency earnings. Other sources
of income are pearl farming and deep-sea commercial fishing. The
small manufacturing sector primarily processes agricultural
products. The territory benefits substantially from development
agreements with France aimed principally at creating new businesses
and strengthening social services.

@French Southern and Antarctic Lands

Introduction
French Southern and Antarctic Lands



Background:

In February 2007, the Iles Eparses became an integral part of the
French Southern and Antarctic Lands (TAAF). The Southern Lands are
now divided into five administrative districts, two of which are
archipelagos, Iles Crozet and Iles Kerguelen; the third is a
district composed of two volcanic islands, Ile Saint-Paul and Ile
Amsterdam; the fourth, Iles Eparses, consists of five scattered
tropical islands around Madagascar. They contain no permanent
inhabitants and are visited only by researchers studying the native
fauna, scientists at the various scientific stations, fishermen, and
military personnel. The fifth district is the Antarctic portion,
which consists of "Adelie Land," a thin slice of the Antarctic
continent discovered and claimed by the French in 1840.
Ile Amsterdam: Discovered but not named in 1522 by the Spanish, the
island subsequently received the appellation of Nieuw Amsterdam from
a Dutchman; it was claimed by France in 1843. A short-lived attempt
at cattle farming began in 1871. A French meteorological station
established on the island in 1949 is still in use.
Ile Saint Paul: Claimed by France since 1893, the island was a
fishing industry center from 1843 to 1914. In 1928, a spiny lobster
cannery was established, but when the company went bankrupt in 1931,
seven workers were abandoned. Only two survived until 1934 when
rescue finally arrived.
Iles Crozet: A large archipelago formed from the Crozet Plateau,
Iles Crozet is divided into two main groups: L'Occidental (the
West), which includes Ile aux Cochons, Ilots des Apotres, Ile des
Pingouins, and the reefs Brisants de l'Heroine; and L'Oriental (the
east), which includes Ile d'Est and Ile de la Possession (the
largest island of the Crozets). Discovered and claimed by France in
1772, the islands were used for seal hunting and as a base for
whaling. Originally administered as a dependency of Madagascar, they
became part of the TAAF in 1955.
Iles Kerguelen: This island group, discovered in 1772, is made up of
one large island (Ile Kerguelen) and about 300 smaller islands. A
permanent group of 50 to 100 scientists resides at the main base at
Port-aux-Francais.
Adelie Land: The only non-insular district of the TAAF is the
Antarctic claim known as "Adelie Land." The US Government does not
recognize it as a French dependency.
Bassas da India: A French possession since 1897, this atoll is a
volcanic rock surrounded by reefs and is awash at high tide.
Europa Island: This heavily wooded island has been a French
possession since 1897; it is the site of a small military garrison
that staffs a weather station.
Glorioso Islands: A French possession since 1892, the Glorioso
Islands are composed of two lushly vegetated coral islands (Ile
Glorieuse and Ile du Lys) and three rock islets. A military garrison
operates a weather and radio station on Ile Glorieuse.
Juan de Nova Island: Named after a famous 15th century Spanish
navigator and explorer, the island has been a French possession
since 1897. It has been exploited for its guano and phosphate.
Presently a small military garrison oversees a meteorological
station.
Tromelin Island: First explored by the French in 1776, the island
came under the jurisdiction of Reunion in 1814. At present, it
serves as a sea turtle sanctuary and is the site of an important
meteorological station.

Introduction
Gabon



Background:

Only two autocratic presidents have ruled Gabon since independence
from France in 1960. The current president of Gabon, El Hadj Omar
BONGO Ondimba - one of the longest-serving heads of state in the
world - has dominated the country's political scene for four
decades. President BONGO introduced a nominal multiparty system and
a new constitution in the early 1990s. However, allegations of
electoral fraud during local elections in 2002-03 and the
presidential elections in 2005 have exposed the weaknesses of formal
political structures in Gabon. Gabon's political opposition remains
weak, divided, and financially dependent on the current regime.
Despite political conditions, a small population, abundant natural
resources, and considerable foreign support have helped make Gabon
one of the more prosperous and stable African countries.

Economy
Gabon



Economy - overview:

Gabon enjoys a per capita income four times that of most of
sub-Saharan African nations. but because of high income inequality,
a large proportion of the population remains poor. Gabon depended on
timber and manganese until oil was discovered offshore in the early
1970s. The oil sector now accounts for 50% of GDP. Gabon continues
to face fluctuating prices for its oil, timber, and manganese
exports. Despite the abundance of natural wealth, poor fiscal
management hobbles the economy. The devaluation of the CFA franc -
its currency - by 50% in January 1994 sparked a one-time
inflationary surge, to 35%; the rate dropped to 6% in 1996. The IMF
provided a one-year standby arrangement in 1994-95, a three-year
Enhanced Financing Facility (EFF) at near commercial rates beginning
in late 1995, and stand-by credit of $119 million in October 2000.
Those agreements mandated progress in privatization and fiscal
discipline. France provided additional financial support in January
1997 after Gabon met IMF targets for mid-1996. In 1997, an IMF
mission to Gabon criticized the government for overspending on
off-budget items, overborrowing from the central bank, and slipping
on its schedule for privatization and administrative reform. The
rebound of oil prices since 1999 have helped growth, but drops in
production have hampered Gabon from fully realizing potential gains,
and will continue to temper the gains for most of this decade. In
December 2000, Gabon signed a new agreement with the Paris Club to
reschedule its official debt. A follow-up bilateral repayment
agreement with the US was signed in December 2001. Gabon signed a
14-month Stand-By Arrangement with the IMF in May 2004, and received
Paris Club debt rescheduling later that year. Short-term progress
depends on an upbeat world economy and fiscal and other adjustments
in line with IMF policies.

Introduction
Gambia, The



Background:

The Gambia gained its independence from the UK in 1965.
Geographically surrounded by Senegal, it formed a short-lived
federation of Senegambia between 1982 and 1989. In 1991 the two
nations signed a friendship and cooperation treaty, but tensions
have flared up intermittently since then. Yahya A. J. J. JAMMEH led
a military coup in 1994 that overthrew the president and banned
political activity. A new constitution and presidential elections in
1996, followed by parliamentary balloting in 1997, completed a
nominal return to civilian rule. JAMMEH has been elected president
in all subsequent elections, including most recently in late 2006.

Economy
Gambia, The



Economy - overview:

The Gambia has no confirmed mineral or natural resource deposits and
has a limited agricultural base. About 75% of the population depends
on crops and livestock for its livelihood. Small-scale manufacturing
activity features the processing of peanuts, fish, and hides.
Reexport trade normally constitutes a major segment of economic
activity, but a 1999 government-imposed preshipment inspection plan,
and instability of the Gambian dalasi (currency) have drawn some of
the reexport trade away from The Gambia. The Gambia's natural beauty
and proximity to Europe has made it one of the larger markets for
tourism in West Africa. The government's 1998 seizure of the private
peanut firm Alimenta eliminated the largest purchaser of Gambian
groundnuts. Despite an announced program to begin privatizing key
parastatals, no plans have been made public that would indicate that
the government intends to follow through on its promises.
Unemployment and underemployment rates remain extremely high;
short-run economic progress depends on sustained bilateral and
multilateral aid, on responsible government economic management, on
continued technical assistance from the IMF and bilateral donors,
and on expected growth in the construction sector.

@Gaza Strip

Introduction
Gaza Strip



Background:

The September 1993 Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles on Interim
Self-Government Arrangements provided for a transitional period of
Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Under a
series of agreements signed between May 1994 and September 1999,
Israel transferred to the Palestinian Authority (PA) security and
civilian responsibility for Palestinian-populated areas of the West
Bank and Gaza. Negotiations to determine the permanent status of the
West Bank and Gaza stalled following the outbreak of an intifada in
September 2000, as Israeli forces reoccupied most
Palestinian-controlled areas. In April 2003, the Quartet (US, EU,
UN, and Russia) presented a roadmap to a final settlement of the
conflict by 2005 based on reciprocal steps by the two parties
leading to two states, Israel and a democratic Palestine. The
proposed date for a permanent status agreement was postponed
indefinitely due to violence and accusations that both sides had not
followed through on their commitments. Following Palestinian leader
Yasir ARAFAT's death in late 2004, Mahmud ABBAS was elected PA
president in January 2005. A month later, Israel and the PA agreed
to the Sharm el-Sheikh Commitments in an effort to move the peace
process forward. In September 2005, Israel unilaterally withdrew all
its settlers and soldiers and dismantled its military facilities in
the Gaza Strip and withdrew settlers and redeployed soldiers from
four small northern West Bank settlements. Nonetheless, Israel
controls maritime, airspace, and most access to the Gaza Strip. A
November 2005 PA-Israeli agreement authorized the reopening of the
Rafah border crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt under joint
PA and Egyptian control. In January 2006, the Islamic Resistance
Movement, HAMAS, won control of the Palestinian Legislative Council
(PLC). The international community refused to accept the HAMAS-led
government because it did not recognize Israel, would not renounce
violence, and refused to honor previous peace agreements between
Israel and the PA. HAMAS took control of the PA government in March
2006, but President ABBAS had little success negotiating with HAMAS
to present a political platform acceptable to the international
community so as to lift economic sanctions on Palestinians. The PLC
was unable to convene throughout most of 2006 as a result of
Israel's detention of many HAMAS PLC members and Israeli-imposed
travel restrictions on other PLC members. Violent clashes took place
between Fatah and HAMAS supporters in the Gaza Strip in 2006 and
early 2007, resulting in numerous Palestinian deaths and injuries.
ABBAS and HAMAS Political Bureau Chief MISHAL in February 2007
signed the Mecca Agreement in Saudi Arabia that resulted in the
formation of a Palestinian National Unity Government (NUG) headed by
HAMAS member Ismail HANIYA. However, fighting continued in the Gaza
Strip, and in June, HAMAS militants succeeded in a violent takeover
of all military and governmental institutions in the Gaza Strip.
ABBAS dismissed the NUG and through a series of Presidential decrees
formed a PA government in the West Bank led by independent Salam
FAYYAD. HAMAS rejected the NUG's dismissal and has called for
resuming talks with Fatah, but ABBAS has ruled out negotiations
until HAMAS agrees to a return of PA control over the Gaza Strip and
recognizes the FAYYAD-led government. FAYYAD and his PA government
initiated a series of security and economic reforms to improve
conditions in the West Bank. ABBAS participated in talks with
Israel's Prime Minister OLMERT and secured the release of some
Palestinian prisoners and previously withheld customs revenue.
During a November 2007 international meeting in Annapolis Maryland,
ABBAS and OLMERT agreed to resume peace negotiations with the goal
of reaching a final peace settlement by the end of 2008.

Economy
Gaza Strip



Economy - overview:

High population density, limited land access, and strict internal
and external security controls have kept economic conditions in the
Gaza Strip - the smaller of the two areas under the Palestinian
Authority (PA)- even more degraded than in the West Bank. The
beginning of the second intifada in September 2000 sparked an
economic downturn, largely the result of Israeli closure policies;
these policies, which were imposed to address security concerns in
Israel, disrupted labor and trade access to and from the Gaza Strip.
In 2001, and even more severely in 2003, Israeli military measures
in PA areas resulted in the destruction of capital, the disruption
of administrative structures, and widespread business closures. The
Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip in September 2005 offered
some medium-term opportunities for economic growth, but continued
Israeli-imposed crossings closures, which became more restrictive
after Hamas violently took over the territory in June 2007, have
resulted in widespread private sector layoffs and shortages of most
goods.

Introduction
Georgia



Background:

The region of present-day Georgia contained the ancient kingdoms of
Colchis and Kartli-Iberia. The area came under Roman influence in
the first centuries A.D. and Christianity became the state religion
in the 330s. Domination by Persians, Arabs, and Turks was followed
by a Georgian golden age (11th-13th centuries) that was cut short by
the Mongol invasion of 1236. Subsequently, the Ottoman and Persian
empires competed for influence in the region. Georgia was absorbed
into the Russian Empire in the 19th century. Independent for three
years (1918-1921) following the Russian revolution, it was forcibly
incorporated into the USSR until the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991.
An attempt by the incumbent Georgian government to manipulate
national legislative elections in November 2003 touched off
widespread protests that led to the resignation of Eduard
SHEVARDNADZE, president since 1995. New elections in early 2004
swept Mikheil SAAKASHVILI into power along with his National
Movement party. Progress on market reforms and democratization has
been made in the years since independence, but this progress has
been complicated by Russian assistance and support to the breakaway
regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Georgian military action in
South Ossetia in early August 2008 led to a Russian military
response that not only occupied the breakaway areas, but large
portions of Georgia proper as well. Russian troops pulled back from
most occupied Georgian territory, but in late August 2008 Russia
unilaterally recognized the independence of Abkhazia and South
Ossetia. This action was strongly condemned by most of the world's
nations and international organizations.

Economy
Georgia



Economy - overview:

Georgia's economy has sustained robust GDP growth of close to 10% in
2006 and 12% in 2007, based on strong inflows of foreign investment
and robust government spending. However, a widening trade deficit
and higher inflation are emerging risks to the economy. Areas of
recent improvement include increasing foreign direct investment as
well as growth in the construction, banking services and mining
sectors. Georgia's main economic activities include the cultivation
of agricultural products such as grapes, citrus fruits, and
hazelnuts; mining of manganese and copper; and output of a small
industrial sector producing alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages,
metals, machinery, aircraft and chemicals. The country imports
nearly all its needed supplies of natural gas and oil products. It
has sizeable hydropower capacity, a growing component of its energy
supplies. Despite the severe damage the economy suffered due to
civil strife in the 1990s, Georgia, with the help of the IMF and
World Bank, has made substantial economic gains since 2000,
achieving positive GDP growth and curtailing inflation. Georgia's
GDP growth neared 10% in 2006 and 2007 despite restrictions on
commerce with Russia. Areas of recent improvement include increased
foreign direct investment as well as growth in the construction,
banking services, and mining sectors. In addition, the reinvigorated
privatization process has met with success. However, a widening
trade deficit and higher inflation are emerging risks to the
economy. Georgia has suffered from a chronic failure to collect tax
revenues; however, the new government is making progress and has
reformed the tax code, improved tax administration, increased tax
enforcement, and cracked down on corruption. Government revenues
have increased nearly four fold since 2003. Due to improvements in
customs and financial (tax) enforcement, smuggling is a declining
problem. Georgia has overcome the chronic energy shortages of the
past by renovating hydropower plants and by bringing newly available
natural gas supplies from Azerbaijan. It also has an increased
ability to pay for more expensive gas imports from Russia. The
country is pinning its hopes for long-term growth on a determined
effort to reduce regulation, taxes and corruption in order to
attract foreign investment. The construction on the
Baku-T'bilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline, the Baku-T'bilisi-Erzerum gas
pipeline, and the Kars-Akhalkalaki Railroad are part of a strategy
to capitalize on Georgia's strategic location between Europe and
Asia and develop its role as a transit point for gas, oil and other
goods.

Introduction
Germany



Background:

As Europe's largest economy and second most populous nation, Germany
is a key member of the continent's economic, political, and defense
organizations. European power struggles immersed Germany in two
devastating World Wars in the first half of the 20th century and
left the country occupied by the victorious Allied powers of the US,
UK, France, and the Soviet Union in 1945. With the advent of the
Cold War, two German states were formed in 1949: the western Federal
Republic of Germany (FRG) and the eastern German Democratic Republic
(GDR). The democratic FRG embedded itself in key Western economic
and security organizations, the EC, which became the EU, and NATO,
while the Communist GDR was on the front line of the Soviet-led
Warsaw Pact. The decline of the USSR and the end of the Cold War
allowed for German unification in 1990. Since then, Germany has
expended considerable funds to bring Eastern productivity and wages
up to Western standards. In January 1999, Germany and 10 other EU
countries introduced a common European exchange currency, the euro.

Economy
Germany



Economy - overview:

Germany's affluent and technologically powerful economy - the fifth
largest in the world in PPP terms - showed considerable improvement
in 2007 with 2.6% growth. After a long period of stagnation with an
average growth rate of 0.7% between 2001-05 and chronically high
unemployment, stronger growth led to a considerable fall in
unemployment to about 8% near the end of 2007. Among the most
important reasons for Germany's high unemployment during the past
decade were macroeconomic stagnation, the declining level of
investment in plant and equipment, company restructuring, flat
domestic consumption, structural rigidities in the labor market,
lack of competition in the service sector, and high interest rates.
The modernization and integration of the eastern German economy
continues to be a costly long-term process, with annual transfers
from west to east amounting to roughly $80 billion. The former
government of Chancellor Gerhard SCHROEDER launched a comprehensive
set of reforms of labor market and welfare-related institutions. The
current government of Chancellor Angela MERKEL has initiated other
reform measures, such as a gradual increase in the mandatory
retirement age from 65 to 67 and measures to increase female
participation in the labor market. Germany's aging population,
combined with high chronic unemployment, has pushed social security
outlays to a level exceeding contributions, but higher government
revenues from the cyclical upturn in 2006-07 and a 3% rise in the
value-added tax pushed Germany's budget deficit well below the EU's
3% debt limit. Corporate restructuring and growing capital markets
are setting the foundations that could help Germany meet the
long-term challenges of European economic integration and
globalization, although some economists continue to argue the need
for change in inflexible labor and services markets. Growth may fall
below 2% in 2008 as the strong euro, high oil prices, tighter credit
markets, and slowing growth abroad take their toll.

Introduction
Ghana



Background:

Formed from the merger of the British colony of the Gold Coast and
the Togoland trust territory, Ghana in 1957 became the first
sub-Saharan country in colonial Africa to gain its independence.
Ghana endured a long series of coups before Lt. Jerry RAWLINGS took
power in 1981 and banned political parties. After approving a new
constitution and restoring multiparty politics in 1992, RAWLINGS won
presidential elections in 1992 and 1996, but was constitutionally
prevented from running for a third term in 2000. John KUFUOR
succeeded him and was reelected in 2004. Kufuor is constitutionally
barred from running for a third term in upcoming Presidential
elections, which are scheduled for December 2008.

Economy
Ghana



Economy - overview:

Well endowed with natural resources, Ghana has roughly twice the per
capita output of the poorest countries in West Africa. Even so,
Ghana remains heavily dependent on international financial and
technical assistance. Gold and cocoa production, and individual
remittances, are major sources of foreign exchange. The domestic
economy continues to revolve around agriculture, which accounts for
about 35% of GDP and employs about 55% of the work force, mainly
small landholders. Ghana opted for debt relief under the Heavily
Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) program in 2002, and is also benefiting
from the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative that took effect in
2006. Thematic priorities under its current Growth and Poverty
Reduction Strategy, which also provides the framework for
development partner assistance, are: macroeconomic stability;
private sector competitiveness; human resource development; and good
governance and civic responsibility. Sound macro-economic management
along with high prices for gold and cocoa helped sustain GDP growth
in 2007. Ghana signed a Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC)
Compact in 2006, which aims to assist in transforming Ghana's
agricultural sector.

Introduction
Gibraltar



Background:

Strategically important, Gibraltar was reluctantly ceded to Great
Britain by Spain in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht; the British garrison
was formally declared a colony in 1830. In a referendum held in
1967, Gibraltarians voted overwhelmingly to remain a British
dependency. The subsequent granting of autonomy in 1969 by the UK
led to Spain closing the border and severing all communication
links. A series of talks were held by the UK and Spain between 1997
and 2002 on establishing temporary joint sovereignty over Gibraltar.
In response to these talks, the Gibraltar Government called a
referendum in late 2002 in which the majority of citizens voted
overwhelmingly against any sharing of sovereignty with Spain. Since
the referendum, tripartite talks on other issues have been held with
Spain, the UK, and Gibraltar, and in September 2006 a three-way
agreement was signed. Spain agreed to remove restrictions on air
movements, to speed up customs procedures, to implement
international telephone dialing, and to allow mobile roaming
agreements. Britain agreed to pay increased pensions to Spaniards
who had been employed in Gibraltar before the border closed. Spain
will be allowed to open a cultural institute from which the Spanish
flag will fly. A new noncolonial constitution came into effect in
2007, but the UK retains responsibility for defense, foreign
relations, internal security, and financial stability.

Economy
Gibraltar



Economy - overview:

Self-sufficient Gibraltar benefits from an extensive shipping trade,
offshore banking, and its position as an international conference
center. The British military presence has been sharply reduced and
now contributes about 7% to the local economy, compared with 60% in
1984. The financial sector, tourism (almost 5 million visitors in
1998), shipping services fees, and duties on consumer goods also
generate revenue. The financial sector, the shipping sector, and
tourism each contribute 25%-30% of GDP. Telecommunications accounts
for another 10%. In recent years, Gibraltar has seen major

Introduction
Greece



Background:

Greece achieved independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1829. During
the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th
century, it gradually added neighboring islands and territories,
most with Greek-speaking populations. In World War II, Greece was
first invaded by Italy (1940) and subsequently occupied by Germany
(1941-44); fighting endured in a protracted civil war between
supporters of the king and Communist rebels. Following the latter's
defeat in 1949, Greece joined NATO in 1952. A military dictatorship,
which in 1967 suspended many political liberties and forced the king
to flee the country, lasted seven years. The 1974 democratic
elections and a referendum created a parliamentary republic and
abolished the monarchy. In 1981, Greece joined the EC (now the EU);
it became the 12th member of the European Economic and Monetary
Union in 2001.

Economy
Greece



Economy - overview:

Greece has a capitalist economy with the public sector accounting
for about 40% of GDP and with per capita GDP at least 75% of the
leading euro-zone economies. Tourism provides 15% of GDP. Immigrants
make up nearly one-fifth of the work force, mainly in agricultural
and unskilled jobs. Greece is a major beneficiary of EU aid, equal
to about 3.3% of annual GDP. The Greek economy grew by nearly 4.0%
per year between 2003 and 2007, due partly to infrastructural
spending related to the 2004 Athens Olympic Games, and in part to an
increased availability of credit, which has sustained record levels
of consumer spending. Greece violated the EU's Growth and Stability
Pact budget deficit criteria of no more than 3% of GDP from 2001 to
2006, but finally met that criteria in 2007. Public debt, inflation,
and unemployment are above the euro-zone average, but are falling.
The Greek Government continues to grapple with cutting government
spending, reducing the size of the public sector, and reforming the
labor and pension systems, in the face of often vocal opposition
from the country's powerful labor unions and the general public. The
economy remains an important domestic political issue in Greece and,
while the ruling New Democracy government has had some success in
improving economic growth and reducing the budget deficit, Athens
faces long-term challenges in its effort to continue its economic
reforms, especially social security reform and privatization.

Introduction
Greenland



Background:

Greenland, the world's largest island, is about 81% ice-capped.
Vikings reached the island in the 10th century from Iceland; Danish
colonization began in the 18th century, and Greenland was made an
integral part of Denmark in 1953. It joined the European Community
(now the EU) with Denmark in 1973, but withdrew in 1985 over a
dispute centered on stringent fishing quotas. Greenland was granted
self-government in 1979 by the Danish parliament; the law went into
effect the following year. Denmark continues to exercise control of
Greenland's foreign affairs in consultation with Greenland's Home
Rule Government.

Economy
Greenland



Economy - overview:

The economy remains critically dependent on exports of fish and a
substantial subsidy from the Danish Government, which supplies about
half of government revenues. The public sector, including publicly
owned enterprises and the municipalities, plays the dominant role in
the economy. Several interesting hydrocarbon and mineral exploration
activities are ongoing. Press reports in early 2007 indicated that
two international aluminum companies were considering building
smelters in Greenland to take advantage of local hydropower
potential. Tourism is the only sector offering any near-term
potential, and even this is limited due to a short season and high
costs. Air Greenland began summer-season direct flights to the US
east coast in May 2007, potentially opening a major new tourism
market.

Introduction
Grenada



Background:

Carib Indians inhabited Grenada when COLUMBUS discovered the island
in 1498, but it remained uncolonized for more than a century. The
French settled Grenada in the 17th century, established sugar
estates, and imported large numbers of African slaves. Britain took
the island in 1762 and vigorously expanded sugar production. In the
19th century, cacao eventually surpassed sugar as the main export
crop; in the 20th century, nutmeg became the leading export. In
1967, Britain gave Grenada autonomy over its internal affairs. Full
independence was attained in 1974, making Grenada one of the
smallest independent countries in the Western Hemisphere. Grenada
was seized by a Marxist military council on 19 October 1983. Six
days later the island was invaded by US forces and those of six
other Caribbean nations, which quickly captured the ringleaders and
their hundreds of Cuban advisers. Free elections were reinstituted
the following year and have continued since that time. Hurricane
Ivan struck Grenada in September of 2004 causing severe damage.

Economy
Grenada



Economy - overview:

Grenada relies on tourism as its main source of foreign exchange,
especially since the construction of an international airport in
1985. Strong performances in construction and manufacturing,
together with the development of an offshore financial industry,
have also contributed to growth in national output. Grenada has
rebounded from the devastating effects of Hurricanes Ivan (2004) and
Emily (2005), but is now saddled with the debt burden from the
rebuilding process. The agricultural sector, particularly nutmeg and
cocoa cultivation, has gradually recovered, and the tourism sector
has seen substantial increases in foreign direct investment as the
regional share of the tourism market increases.

formally ending the conflict, which had left more than 100,000
people dead and had created, by some estimates, some 1 million
refugees.

Economy
Guatemala



Economy - overview:

Guatemala is the most populous of the Central American countries
with a GDP per capita roughly one-half that of Argentina, Brazil,
and Chile. The agricultural sector accounts for about one-tenth of
GDP, two-fifths of exports, and half of the labor force. Coffee,
sugar, and bananas are the main products, with sugar exports
benefiting from increased global demand for ethanol. The 1996
signing of peace accords, which ended 36 years of civil war, removed
a major obstacle to foreign investment, and Guatemala since then has
pursued important reforms and macroeconomic stabilization. On 1 July
2006, the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) entered into
force between the US and Guatemala and has since spurred increased
investment in the export sector. The distribution of income remains
highly unequal with about 56% of the population below the poverty
line. Other ongoing challenges include increasing government
revenues, negotiating further assistance from international donors,
upgrading both government and private financial operations,
curtailing drug trafficking and rampant crime, and narrowing the
trade deficit. Given Guatemala's large expatriate community in the
United States, it is the top remittance recipient in Central
America, with inflows serving as a primary source of foreign income
equivalent to nearly two-thirds of exports.

Transnational Issues
Guatemala



Disputes - international:

annual ministerial meetings under the OAS-initiated Agreement on the
Framework for Negotiations and Confidence Building Measures continue
to address Guatemalan land and maritime claims in Belize and the
Caribbean Sea; the Line of Adjacency created under the 2002
Differendum serves in lieu of the contiguous international boundary
to control squatting in the sparsely inhabited rain forests of
Belize's border region; Mexico must deal with thousands of
impoverished Guatemalans and other Central Americans who cross the
porous border looking for work in Mexico and the United States


Refugees and internally displaced persons:

IDPs: undetermined (the UN does not estimate there are any IDPs,
although some NGOs estimate over 200,000 IDPs as a result of over
three decades of internal conflict that ended in 1996) (2007)


Trafficking in persons:

current situation: Guatemala is a source, transit, and destination
country for Guatemalans and Central Americans trafficked for the
purposes of commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor; human
trafficking is a significant and growing problem in the country;
Guatemalan women and children are trafficked within the country for
commercial sexual exploitation, primarily to Mexico and the United
States; Guatemalan men, women, and children are also trafficked
within the country, and to Mexico and the United States, for forced
labor
tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - for a second consecutive year,
Guatemala is on the Tier 2 Watch List for its failure to provide
evidence of increasing efforts to combat trafficking in persons,
particularly with respect to ensuring that trafficking offenders are
appropriately prosecuted for their crimes; while prosecutors
initiated trafficking prosecutions, they continued to face problems
in court with application of Guatemala's comprehensive
anti-trafficking law; the government made modest improvements to its
protection efforts, but assistance remained inadequate overall in
2007 (2008)


Illicit drugs:

major transit country for cocaine and heroin; in 2005, cultivated
100 hectares of opium poppy after reemerging as a potential source
of opium in 2004; potential production of less than 1 metric ton of
pure heroin; marijuana cultivation for mostly domestic consumption;
proximity to Mexico makes Guatemala a major staging area for drugs
(particularly for cocaine); money laundering is a serious problem;
corruption is a major problem

Economy
Guernsey



Economy - overview:

Financial services - banking, fund management, insurance - account
for about 23% of employment and about 55% of total income in this
tiny, prosperous Channel Island economy. Tourism, manufacturing, and
horticulture, mainly tomatoes and cut flowers, have been declining.
Financial services, construction, retail, and the public sector have
been growing. Light tax and death duties make Guernsey a popular tax
haven. The evolving economic integration of the EU nations is
changing the environment under which Guernsey operates.

@Guinea

Introduction
Guinea



Background:

Guinea has had only two presidents since gaining its independence
from France in 1958. Lansana CONTE came to power in 1984 when the
military seized the government after the death of the first
president, Sekou TOURE. Guinea did not hold democratic elections
until 1993 when Gen. CONTE (head of the military government) was
elected president of the civilian government. He was reelected in
1998 and again in 2003, though all the polls have been marred by
irregularities. Guinea has maintained its internal stability despite
spillover effects from conflict in Sierra Leone and Liberia. As
those countries have rebuilt, Guinea's own vulnerability to
political and economic crisis has increased. Declining economic
conditions and popular dissatisfaction with corruption and bad
governance prompted two massive strikes in 2006; a third nationwide
strike in early 2007 sparked violent protests in many Guinean cities
and prompted two weeks of martial law. To appease the unions and end
the unrest, CONTE named a new prime minister in March 2007.

Economy
Guinea



Economy - overview:

Guinea possesses major mineral, hydropower, and agricultural
resources, yet remains an underdeveloped nation. The country has
almost half of the world's bauxite reserves and is the
second-largest bauxite producer. The mining sector accounts for over
70% of exports. Long-run improvements in government fiscal
arrangements, literacy, and the legal framework are needed if the
country is to move out of poverty. Investor confidence has been
sapped by rampant corruption, a lack of electricity and other
infrastructure, a lack of skilled workers, and the political
uncertainty due to the failing health of President Lansana CONTE.
Guinea is trying to reengage with the IMF and World Bank, which cut
off most assistance in 2003, and is working closely with technical
advisors from the U.S. Treasury Department, the World Bank and IMF,
seeking to return to a fully funded program. Growth rose slightly in
2006-07, primarily due to increases in global demand and commodity
prices on world markets, but the standard of living fell. The Guinea
franc depreciated sharply as the prices for basic necessities like
food and fuel rose beyond the reach of most Guineans.
Dissatisfaction with economic conditions prompted nationwide strikes
in February and June 2006.

Disputes - international:

conflicts among rebel groups, warlords, and youth gangs in

occupation of these lands, including the hamlet of Yenga, occupied
since 1998

Leone); 3,900 (Cote d'Ivoire)
IDPs: 19,000 (cross-border incursions from Cote d'Ivoire, Liberia,
Sierra Leone) (2007)


Trafficking in persons:

current situation: Guinea is a source, transit, and destination
country for men, women, and children trafficked for the purposes of
forced labor and sexual exploitation; the majority of victims are
children, and internal trafficking is more prevalent than
transnational trafficking; within the country, girls are trafficked
primarily for domestic servitude and sexual exploitation, while boys
are trafficked for forced agricultural labor, and as forced beggars,
street vendors, shoe shiners, and laborers in gold and diamond
mines; some Guinean men are also trafficked for agricultural labor
within Guinea; transnationally, girls are trafficked into Guinea for
domestic servitude and likely also for sexual exploitation
tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Guinea is on the Tier 2 Watch List
for its failure to provide evidence of increasing efforts to
eliminate trafficking over 2006; Guinea demonstrated minimal law
enforcement efforts for a second year in a row, while protection
efforts diminished over efforts in 2006; the government did not
report any trafficking convictions in 2007; due to a lack of
resources, the government does not provide shelter services for
trafficking victims; the government took no measures to reduce the
demand for commercial sexual exploitation (2008)

Introduction
Guinea-Bissau



Background:

Since independence from Portugal in 1974, Guinea-Bissau has
experienced considerable political and military upheaval. In 1980, a
military coup established authoritarian dictator Joao Bernardo
'Nino' VIEIRA as president. Despite setting a path to a market
economy and multiparty system, VIEIRA's regime was characterized by
the suppression of political opposition and the purging of political
rivals. Several coup attempts through the 1980s and early 1990s
failed to unseat him. In 1994 VIEIRA was elected president in the
country's first free elections. A military mutiny and resulting
civil war in 1998 eventually led to VIEIRA's ouster in May 1999. In
February 2000, a transitional government turned over power to
opposition leader Kumba YALA, after he was elected president in
transparent polling. In September 2003, after only three years in
office, YALA was ousted by the military in a bloodless coup, and
businessman Henrique ROSA was sworn in as interim president. In
2005, former President VIEIRA was re-elected president pledging to
pursue economic development and national reconciliation.

small amounts of peanuts, palm kernels, and timber. Rice is the
major crop and staple food. However, intermittent fighting between
Senegalese-backed government troops and a military junta destroyed
much of the country's infrastructure and caused widespread damage to
the economy in 1998; the civil war led to a 28% drop in GDP that
year, with partial recovery in 1999-2002. Before the war, trade
reform and price liberalization were the most successful part of the
country's structural adjustment program under IMF sponsorship. The
tightening of monetary policy and the development of the private
sector had also begun to reinvigorate the economy. Because of high
costs, the development of petroleum, phosphate, and other mineral
resources is not a near-term prospect. Offshore oil prospecting is
underway in several sectors but has not yet led to commercially
viable crude deposits. The inequality of income distribution is one
of the most extreme in the world. The government and international
donors continue to work out plans to forward economic development
from a lamentably low base. In December 2003, the World Bank, IMF,
and UNDP were forced to step in to provide emergency budgetary
support in the amount of $107 million for 2004, representing over
80% of the total national budget. Government drift and indecision,
however, resulted in continued low growth in 2002-06. Higher raw
material prices boosted growth to 3.7% in 2007.

Introduction
Guyana



Background:

Originally a Dutch colony in the 17th century, by 1815 Guyana had
become a British possession. The abolition of slavery led to black
settlement of urban areas and the importation of indentured servants
from India to work the sugar plantations. This ethnocultural divide
has persisted and has led to turbulent politics. Guyana achieved
independence from the UK in 1966, and since then it has been ruled
mostly by socialist-oriented governments. In 1992, Cheddi JAGAN was
elected president in what is considered the country's first free and
fair election since independence. After his death five years later,
his wife, Janet JAGAN, became president but resigned in 1999 due to
poor health. Her successor, Bharrat JAGDEO, was reelected in 2001
and again in 2006.

Economy
Guyana



Economy - overview:

The Guyanese economy exhibited moderate economic growth in 2001-07,
based on expansion in the agricultural and mining sectors, a more
favorable atmosphere for business initiatives, a more realistic
exchange rate, fairly low inflation, and the continued support of
international organizations. Economic recovery since the 2005
flood-related contraction has been buoyed by increases in
remittances and foreign direct investment. Chronic problems include
a shortage of skilled labor and a deficient infrastructure. The
government is juggling a sizable external debt against the urgent
need for expanded public investment. In March 2007, the
Inter-American Development Bank, Guyana's principal donor, canceled
Guyana's nearly $470 million debt, equivalent to nearly 48% of GDP.
The bauxite mining sector should benefit in the near term from
restructuring and partial privatization, and the state-owned sugar
industry will conduct efficiency increasing modernizations. Export
earnings from agriculture and mining have fallen sharply, while the
import bill has risen, driven by higher energy prices. Guyana's
entrance into the Caricom Single Market and Economy (CSME) in
January 2006 will broaden the country's export market, primarily in
the raw materials sector.

Transnational Issues
Guyana



Disputes - international:

all of the area west of the Essequibo River is claimed by Venezuela
preventing any discussion of a maritime boundary; Guyana has
expressed its intention to join Barbados in asserting claims before
UNCLOS that Trinidad and Tobago's maritime boundary with Venezuela
extends into their waters; Suriname claims a triangle of land
between the New and Kutari/Koetari rivers in a historic dispute over
the headwaters of the Courantyne; Guyana seeks arbitration under
provisions of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) to
resolve the long-standing dispute with Suriname over the axis of the
territorial sea boundary in potentially oil-rich waters


Trafficking in persons:

current situation: Guyana is a source, transit, and destination
country for men, women, and children trafficked for the purposes of
commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor; most trafficking
appears to take place in remote mining camps in the country's
interior; some women and girls are trafficked from northern Brazil;
reporting from other nations suggests Guyanese women and girls are
trafficked for sexual exploitation to neighboring countries and
Guyanese men and boys are subject to labor exploitation in
construction and agriculture; trafficking victims from Suriname,
Brazil, and Venezuela transit Guyana en route to Caribbean
destinations
tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - for a second consecutive year,
Guyana is on the Tier 2 Watch List for failing to provide evidence
of increasing efforts to combat trafficking, particularly in the
area of law enforcement actions against trafficking offenders; the
government has yet to produce an anti-trafficking conviction under
the comprehensive Combating of Trafficking in Persons Act, which
became law in 2005; the government operates no shelters for
trafficking victims, but did include limited funding for
anti-trafficking NGOs in its 2008 budget; the government did not
make any effort to reduce demand for commercial sex acts during 2007
(2008)


Illicit drugs:

transshipment point for narcotics from South America - primarily
Venezuela - to Europe and the US; producer of cannabis; rising money
laundering related to drug trafficking and human smuggling

Introduction
Haiti



Background:

The native Taino Amerindians - who inhabited the island of
Hispaniola when it was discovered by COLUMBUS in 1492 - were
virtually annihilated by Spanish settlers within 25 years. In the
early 17th century, the French established a presence on Hispaniola,
and in 1697, Spain ceded to the French the western third of the
island, which later became Haiti. The French colony, based on
forestry and sugar-related industries, became one of the wealthiest
in the Caribbean, but only through the heavy importation of African
slaves and considerable environmental degradation. In the late 18th
century, Haiti's nearly half million slaves revolted under Toussaint
L'OUVERTURE. After a prolonged struggle, Haiti became the first
black republic to declare its independence in 1804. The poorest
country in the Western Hemisphere, Haiti has been plagued by
political violence for most of its history. After an armed rebellion
led to the forced resignation and exile of President Jean-Bertrand
ARISTIDE in February 2004, an interim government took office to
organize new elections under the auspices of the United Nations
Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH). Continued violence and
technical delays prompted repeated postponements, but Haiti finally
did inaugurate a democratically elected president and parliament in
May of 2006.

Economy
Haiti



Economy - overview:

Haiti is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, with 80% of
the population living under the poverty line and 54% in abject
poverty. Two-thirds of all Haitians depend on the agricultural
sector, mainly small-scale subsistence farming, and remain
vulnerable to damage from frequent natural disasters, exacerbated by
the country's widespread deforestation. A macroeconomic program
developed in 2005 with the help of the International Monetary Fund
helped the economy grow 3.5% in 2007, the highest growth rate since
1999. US economic engagement under the Haitian Hemispheric
Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement (HOPE) Act, passed in
December 2006, has boosted the garment and automotive parts exports
and investment by providing tariff-free access to the US. Haiti
suffers from high inflation, a lack of investment because of
insecurity and limited infrastructure, and a severe trade deficit.
In 2005, Haiti paid its arrears to the World Bank, paving the way
for reengagement with the Bank. The government relies on formal
international economic assistance for fiscal sustainability.
Remittances are the primary source of foreign exchange, equaling
nearly a quarter of GDP and more than twice the earnings from
exports.

@Holy See (Vatican City)

Introduction
Holy See (Vatican City)



Background:

Popes in their secular role ruled portions of the Italian peninsula
for more than a thousand years until the mid 19th century, when many
of the Papal States were seized by the newly united Kingdom of
Italy. In 1870, the pope's holdings were further circumscribed when
Rome itself was annexed. Disputes between a series of "prisoner"
popes and Italy were resolved in 1929 by three Lateran Treaties,
which established the independent state of Vatican City and granted
Roman Catholicism special status in Italy. In 1984, a concordat
between the Holy See and Italy modified certain of the earlier

Introduction
Honduras



Background:

Once part of Spain's vast empire in the New World, Honduras became
an independent nation in 1821. After two and a half decades of
mostly military rule, a freely elected civilian government came to
power in 1982. During the 1980s, Honduras proved a haven for
anti-Sandinista contras fighting the Marxist Nicaraguan Government
and an ally to Salvadoran Government forces fighting leftist
guerrillas. The country was devastated by Hurricane Mitch in 1998,
which killed about 5,600 people and caused approximately $2 billion
in damage.

Economy
Honduras



Economy - overview:

Honduras, the second poorest country in Central America and one of
the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere, with an
extraordinarily unequal distribution of income and massive
unemployment, is banking on expanded trade under the US-Central
America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) and on debt relief under the
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. Despite
improvements in tax collections, the government's fiscal deficit is
growing due to increases in current expenditures and financial
losses from the state energy and telephone companies. Honduras is
the fastest growing remittance destination in the region with
inflows representing over a quarter of GDP, equivalent to nearly
three-quarters of exports. The economy relies heavily on a narrow
range of exports, notably bananas and coffee, making it vulnerable
to natural disasters and shifts in commodity prices, however,
investments in the maquila and non-traditional export sectors are
slowly diversifying the economy. Growth remains dependent on the
economy of the US, its largest trading partner, and on reduction of
the high crime rate, as a means of attracting and maintaining
investment.

ruling in 2003; the 1992 ICJ ruling advised a tripartite resolution
to a maritime boundary in the Gulf of Fonseca with consideration of
Honduran access to the Pacific; El Salvador continues to claim tiny
Conejo Island, not mentioned in the ICJ ruling, off Honduras in the
Gulf of Fonseca; Honduras claims the Belizean-administered Sapodilla
Cays off the coast of Belize in its constitution, but agreed to a

Introduction
Hong Kong



Background:

Occupied by the UK in 1841, Hong Kong was formally ceded by China
the following year; various adjacent lands were added later in the
19th century. Pursuant to an agreement signed by China and the UK on
19 December 1984, Hong Kong became the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) of China on 1 July 1997. In this
agreement, China promised that, under its "one country, two systems"
formula, China's socialist economic system would not be imposed on
Hong Kong and that Hong Kong would enjoy a high degree of autonomy
in all matters except foreign and defense affairs for the next 50
years.

Economy
Hong Kong



Economy - overview:

Hong Kong has a free market economy highly dependent on
international trade. In 2006, the total value of goods and services
trade, including the sizable share of reexports, was equivalent to
400% of GDP. The territory has become increasingly integrated with
mainland China over the past few years through trade, tourism, and
financial links. The mainland has long been Hong Kong's largest
trading partner, accounting for 46% of Hong Kong's total trade by
value in 2006. As a result of China's easing of travel restrictions,
the number of mainland tourists to the territory has surged from 4.5
million in 2001 to 13.6 million in 2006, when they outnumbered
visitors from all other countries combined. Hong Kong has also
established itself as the premier stock market for Chinese firms
seeking to list abroad. Bolstered by several successful initial
public offerings in early 2007, by September 2007 mainland companies
accounted for one-third of the firms listed on the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange, and more than half of the Exchange's market
capitalization. During the past decade, as Hong Kong's manufacturing
industry moved to the mainland, its service industry has grown
rapidly and now accounts for 91% of the territory's GDP. Hong Kong's
natural resources are limited, and food and raw materials must be
imported. GDP growth averaged a strong 5% from 1989 to 2007, despite
the economy suffering two recessions during the Asian financial
crisis in 1997-98 and the global downturn in 2001-02. Hong Kong
continues to link its currency closely to the US dollar, maintaining
an arrangement established in 1983.

Introduction
Hungary



Background:

Hungary became a Christian kingdom in A.D. 1000 and for many
centuries served as a bulwark against Ottoman Turkish expansion in
Europe. The kingdom eventually became part of the polyglot
Austro-Hungarian Empire, which collapsed during World War I. The
country fell under Communist rule following World War II. In 1956, a
revolt and an announced withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact were met
with a massive military intervention by Moscow. Under the leadership
of Janos KADAR in 1968, Hungary began liberalizing its economy,
introducing so-called "Goulash Communism." Hungary held its first
multiparty elections in 1990 and initiated a free market economy. It
joined NATO in 1999 and the EU in 2004.

Economy
Hungary



Economy - overview:

Hungary has made the transition from a centrally planned to a market
economy, with a per capita income nearly two-thirds that of the
EU-25 average. The private sector accounts for more than 80% of GDP.
Foreign ownership of and investment in Hungarian firms are
widespread, with cumulative foreign direct investment totaling more
than $60 billion since 1989. Hungary issues investment-grade
sovereign debt. International observers, however, have expressed
concerns over Hungary's fiscal and current account deficits. In
2007, Hungary eliminated a trade deficit that had persisted for
several years. Inflation declined from 14% in 1998 to a low of 3.7%
in 2006, but jumped to 7.8% in 2007. Unemployment has persisted
above 6%. Hungary's labor force participation rate of 57% is one of
the lowest in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD). Germany is by far Hungary's largest economic
partner. Policy challenges include cutting the public sector deficit
to 4% of GDP by 2008, from about 6% in 2007. The government's
austerity program of tax hikes and subsidy cuts has reduced
Hungary's large budget deficit, but the reforms have dampened
domestic consumption, slowing GDP growth to about 2% in 2007. The
government will need to pass additional reforms to ensure the
long-term stability of public finances. The government plans to
eventually lower its public sector deficit to below 3% of GDP to
adopt the euro.

Introduction
Iceland



Background:

Settled by Norwegian and Celtic (Scottish and Irish) immigrants
during the late 9th and 10th centuries A.D., Iceland boasts the
world's oldest functioning legislative assembly, the Althing,
established in 930. Independent for over 300 years, Iceland was
subsequently ruled by Norway and Denmark. Fallout from the Askja
volcano of 1875 devastated the Icelandic economy and caused
widespread famine. Over the next quarter century, 20% of the
island's population emigrated, mostly to Canada and the US. Limited
home rule from Denmark was granted in 1874 and complete independence
attained in 1944. Literacy, longevity, income, and social cohesion
are first-rate by world standards.

Economy
Iceland



Economy - overview:

Iceland's Scandinavian-type economy is basically capitalistic, yet
with an extensive welfare system (including generous housing
subsidies), low unemployment, and remarkably even distribution of
income. In the absence of other natural resources (except for
abundant geothermal power), the economy depends heavily on the
fishing industry, which provides 70% of export earnings and employs
6% of the work force. The economy remains sensitive to declining
fish stocks as well as to fluctuations in world prices for its main
exports: fish and fish products, aluminum, and ferrosilicon.
Substantial foreign investment in the aluminum and hydropower
sectors has boosted economic growth which, nevertheless, has been
volatile and characterized by recurrent imbalances. Government
policies include reducing the current account deficit, limiting
foreign borrowing, containing inflation, revising agricultural and
fishing policies, and diversifying the economy. The government
remains opposed to EU membership, primarily because of Icelanders'
concern about losing control over their fishing resources. Iceland's
economy has been diversifying into manufacturing and service
industries in the last decade, and new developments in software
production, biotechnology, and financial services are taking place.
The tourism sector is also expanding, with the recent trends in
ecotourism and whale watching. The 2006 closure of the US military
base at Keflavik had very little impact on the national economy;
Iceland's low unemployment rate aided former base employees in
finding alternate employment.

Introduction
India



Background:

Aryan tribes from the northwest infiltrated onto the Indian
subcontinent about 1500 B.C.; their merger with the earlier
Dravidian inhabitants created the classical Indian culture. The
Maurya Empire of the 4th and 3rd centuries B.C. - which reached its
zenith under ASHOKA - united much of South Asia. The Golden Age
ushered in by the Gupta dynasty (4th to 6th centuries A.D.) saw a
flowering of Indian science, art, and culture. Arab incursions
starting in the 8th century and Turkic in the 12th were followed by
those of European traders, beginning in the late 15th century. By
the 19th century, Britain had assumed political control of virtually
all Indian lands. Indian armed forces in the British army played a
vital role in both World Wars. Nonviolent resistance to British
colonialism led by Mohandas GANDHI and Jawaharlal NEHRU brought
independence in 1947. The subcontinent was divided into the secular
state of India and the smaller Muslim state of Pakistan. A third war
between the two countries in 1971 resulted in East Pakistan becoming
the separate nation of Bangladesh. India's nuclear weapons testing
in 1998 caused Pakistan to conduct its own tests that same year. The
dispute between the countries over the state of Kashmir is ongoing,
but discussions and confidence-building measures have led to
decreased tensions since 2002. Despite impressive gains in economic
investment and output, India faces pressing problems such as
significant overpopulation, environmental degradation, extensive
poverty, and ethnic and religious strife.

Economy
India



Economy - overview:

India's diverse economy encompasses traditional village farming,
modern agriculture, handicrafts, a wide range of modern industries,
and a multitude of services. Services are the major source of
economic growth, accounting for more than half of India's output
with less than one third of its labor force. About three-fifths of
the work force is in agriculture, leading the United Progressive
Alliance (UPA) government to articulate an economic reform program
that includes developing basic infrastructure to improve the lives
of the rural poor and boost economic performance. The government has
reduced controls on foreign trade and investment. Higher limits on
foreign direct investment were permitted in a few key sectors, such
as telecommunications. However, tariff spikes in sensitive
categories, including agriculture, and incremental progress on
economic reforms still hinder foreign access to India's vast and
growing market. Privatization of government-owned industries remains
stalled and continues to generate political debate; populist
pressure from within the UPA government and from its Left Front
allies continues to restrain needed initiatives. The economy has
posted an average growth rate of more than 7% in the decade since
1997, reducing poverty by about 10 percentage points. India achieved
8.5% GDP growth in 2006, and again in 2007, significantly expanding
production of manufactures. India is capitalizing on its large
numbers of well-educated people skilled in the English language to
become a major exporter of software services and software workers.
Economic expansion has helped New Delhi continue to make progress in
reducing its federal fiscal deficit. However, strong growth combined
with easy consumer credit and a real estate boom fueled inflation
concerns in 2006 and 2007, leading to a series of central bank
interest rate hikes that have slowed credit growth and eased
inflation concerns. The huge and growing population is the
fundamental social, economic, and environmental problem.

Telephone system:

general assessment: recent deregulation and liberalization of
telecommunications laws and policies have prompted rapid growth;
local and long distance service provided throughout all regions of
the country, with services primarily concentrated in the urban
areas; steady improvement is taking place with the recent admission
of private and private-public investors, but combined fixed and
mobile telephone density remains low at about 30 for each 100
persons nationwide and much lower for persons in rural areas; rapid
growth in cellular service with modest declines in fixed lines
domestic: mobile cellular service introduced in 1994 and organized
nationwide into four metropolitan areas and 19 telecom circles each
with about three private service providers and one state-owned
service provider; in recent years significant trunk capacity added
in the form of fiber-optic cable and one of the world's largest
domestic satellite systems, the Indian National Satellite system
(INSAT), with 6 satellites supporting 33,000 very small aperture
terminals (VSAT)
international: country code - 91; a number of major international
submarine cable systems, including Sea-Me-We-3 with landing sites at
Cochin and Mumbai (Bombay), Sea-Me-We-4 with a landing site at
Chennai, Fiber-Optic Link Around the Globe (FLAG) with a landing
site at Mumbai (Bombay), South Africa - Far East (SAFE) with a
landing site at Cochin, the i2i cable network linking to Singapore
with landing sites at Mumbai (Bombay) and Chennai (Madras), and Tata
Indicom linking Singapore and Chennai (Madras), provide a
significant increase in the bandwidth available for both voice and
data traffic; satellite earth stations - 8 Intelsat (Indian Ocean)
and 1 Inmarsat (Indian Ocean region); 9 gateway exchanges operating
from Mumbai (Bombay), New Delhi, Kolkata (Calcutta), Chennai

Transnational Issues
India



Disputes - international:

since China and India launched a security and foreign policy
dialogue in 2005, consolidated discussions related to the dispute
over most of their rugged, militarized boundary, regional nuclear
proliferation, Indian claims that China transferred missiles to
Pakistan, and other matters continue; various talks and
confidence-building measures have cautiously begun to defuse
tensions over Kashmir, particularly since the October 2005
earthquake in the region; Kashmir nevertheless remains the site of
the world's largest and most militarized territorial dispute with
portions under the de facto administration of China (Aksai Chin),
India (Jammu and Kashmir), and Pakistan (Azad Kashmir and Northern
Areas); India and Pakistan have maintained the 2004 cease fire in
Kashmir and initiated discussions on defusing the armed stand-off in
the Siachen glacier region; Pakistan protests India's fencing the
highly militarized Line of Control and construction of the Baglihar
Dam on the Chenab River in Jammu and Kashmir, which is part of the
larger dispute on water sharing of the Indus River and its
tributaries; UN Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan
(UNMOGIP) has maintained a small group of peacekeepers since 1949;
India does not recognize Pakistan's ceding historic Kashmir lands to
China in 1964; to defuse tensions and prepare for discussions on a
maritime boundary, India and Pakistan seek technical resolution of
the disputed boundary in Sir Creek estuary at the mouth of the Rann
of Kutch in the Arabian Sea; Pakistani maps continue to show its
Junagadh claim in Indian Gujarat State; discussions with Bangladesh
remain stalled to delimit a small section of river boundary, to
exchange territory for 51 Bangladeshi exclaves in India and 111
Indian exclaves in Bangladesh, to allocate divided villages, and to
stop illegal cross-border trade, migration, violence, and transit of
terrorists through the porous border; Bangladesh protests India's
attempts to fence off high-traffic sections of the border; dispute
with Bangladesh over New Moore/South Talpatty/Purbasha Island in the
Bay of Bengal deters maritime boundary delimitation; India seeks
cooperation from Bhutan and Burma to keep Indian Nagaland and Assam
separatists from hiding in remote areas along the borders; Joint
Border Committee with Nepal continues to examine contested boundary
sections, including the 400 square kilometer dispute over the source
of the Kalapani River; India maintains a strict border regime to
keep out Maoist insurgents and control illegal cross-border
activities from Nepal


Refugees and internally displaced persons:

refugees (country of origin): 77,200 (Tibet/China); 69,609 (Sri
Lanka); 9,472 (Afghanistan)
IDPs: at least 600,000 (about half are Kashmiri Pandits from Jammu
and Kashmir) (2007)


Trafficking in persons:

current situation: India is a source, destination, and transit
country for men, women, and children trafficked for the purposes of
forced labor and commercial sexual exploitation; internal forced
labor may constitute India's largest trafficking problem; men,
women, and children are held in debt bondage and face forced labor
working in brick kilns, rice mills, agriculture, and embroidery
factories; women and girls are trafficked within the country for the
purposes of commercial sexual exploitation and forced marriage;
children are subjected to forced labor as factory workers, domestic
servants, beggars, and agriculture workers, and have been used as
armed combatants by some terrorist and insurgent groups; India is
also a destination for women and girls from Nepal and Bangladesh
trafficked for the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation; Indian
women are trafficked to the Middle East for commercial sexual
exploitation; men and women from Bangladesh and Nepal are trafficked
through India for forced labor and commercial sexual exploitation in
the Middle East
tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - India is on the Tier 2 Watch List
for a fifth consecutive year for its failure to provide evidence of
increasing efforts to combat human trafficking in 2007; despite the
reported extent of the trafficking crisis in India, government
authorities made uneven efforts to prosecute traffickers and protect
trafficking victims; government authorities continued to rescue
victims of commercial sexual exploitation and forced child labor and
child armed combatants, and began to show progress in law
enforcement against these forms of trafficking; a critical challenge
overall is the lack of punishment for traffickers, effectively
resulting in impunity for acts of human trafficking; India has not
ratified the 2000 UN TIP Protocol (2008)


Illicit drugs:

world's largest producer of licit opium for the pharmaceutical
trade, but an undetermined quantity of opium is diverted to illicit
international drug markets; transit point for illicit narcotics
produced in neighboring countries and throughout Southwest Asia;
illicit producer of methaqualone; vulnerable to narcotics money
laundering through the hawala system; licit ketamine and precursor
production

@Indian Ocean

Introduction
Indian Ocean



Background:

The Indian Ocean is the third largest of the world's five oceans
(after the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean, but larger than the
Southern Ocean and Arctic Ocean). Four critically important access
waterways are the Suez Canal (Egypt), Bab el Mandeb
(Djibouti-Yemen), Strait of Hormuz (Iran-Oman), and Strait of
Malacca (Indonesia-Malaysia). The decision by the International
Hydrographic Organization in the spring of 2000 to delimit a fifth
ocean, the Southern Ocean, removed the portion of the Indian Ocean
south of 60 degrees south latitude.


Geography
Indian Ocean



Location:

body of water between Africa, the Southern Ocean, Asia, and Australia


Geographic coordinates:

20 00 S, 80 00 E


Map references:

Political Map of the World


Area:

total: 68.556 million sq km
note: includes Andaman Sea, Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal, Flores Sea,
Great Australian Bight, Gulf of Aden, Gulf of Oman, Java Sea,
Mozambique Channel, Persian Gulf, Red Sea, Savu Sea, Strait of
Malacca, Timor Sea, and other tributary water bodies


Area - comparative:

about 5.5 times the size of the US


Coastline:

66,526 km


Climate:

northeast monsoon (December to April), southwest monsoon (June to
October); tropical cyclones occur during May/June and
October/November in the northern Indian Ocean and January/February
in the southern Indian Ocean


Terrain:

surface dominated by counterclockwise gyre (broad, circular system
of currents) in the southern Indian Ocean; unique reversal of
surface currents in the northern Indian Ocean; low atmospheric
pressure over southwest Asia from hot, rising, summer air results in
the southwest monsoon and southwest-to-northeast winds and currents,
while high pressure over northern Asia from cold, falling, winter
air results in the northeast monsoon and northeast-to-southwest
winds and currents; ocean floor is dominated by the Mid-Indian Ocean
Ridge and subdivided by the Southeast Indian Ocean Ridge, Southwest
Indian Ocean Ridge, and Ninetyeast Ridge


Elevation extremes:

lowest point: Java Trench -7,258 m
highest point: sea level 0 m


Natural resources:

oil and gas fields, fish, shrimp, sand and gravel aggregates, placer
deposits, polymetallic nodules


Natural hazards:

occasional icebergs pose navigational hazard in southern reaches


Environment - current issues:

endangered marine species include the dugong, seals, turtles, and
whales; oil pollution in the Arabian Sea, Persian Gulf, and Red Sea


Geography - note:

major chokepoints include Bab el Mandeb, Strait of Hormuz, Strait of
Malacca, southern access to the Suez Canal, and the Lombok Strait




Economy
Indian Ocean



Economy - overview:

The Indian Ocean provides major sea routes connecting the Middle
East, Africa, and East Asia with Europe and the Americas. It carries
a particularly heavy traffic of petroleum and petroleum products
from the oilfields of the Persian Gulf and Indonesia. Its fish are
of great and growing importance to the bordering countries for
domestic consumption and export. Fishing fleets from Russia, Japan,
South Korea, and Taiwan also exploit the Indian Ocean, mainly for
shrimp and tuna. Large reserves of hydrocarbons are being tapped in
the offshore areas of Saudi Arabia, Iran, India, and western
Australia. An estimated 40% of the world's offshore oil production
comes from the Indian Ocean. Beach sands rich in heavy minerals and
offshore placer deposits are actively exploited by bordering
countries, particularly India, South Africa, Indonesia, Sri Lanka,
and Thailand.



Transportation
Indian Ocean



Ports and terminals:

Chennai (Madras; India), Colombo (Sri Lanka), Durban (South Africa),
Jakarta (Indonesia), Kolkata (Calcutta; India) Melbourne
(Australia), Mumbai (Bombay; India), Richards Bay (South Africa)


Transportation - note:

the International Maritime Bureau reports the territorial waters of
littoral states and offshore waters as high risk for piracy and
armed robbery against ships, particularly in the Gulf of Aden, along
the east coast of Africa, the Bay of Bengal, and the Strait of
Malacca; numerous vessels, including commercial shipping and
pleasure craft, have been attacked and hijacked both at anchor and
while underway; hijacked vessels are often disguised and cargoes
stolen; crew and passengers are often held for ransom, murdered, or
cast adrift



Transnational Issues

@Indonesia

Introduction
Indonesia



Background:

The Dutch began to colonize Indonesia in the early 17th century; the
islands were occupied by Japan from 1942 to 1945. Indonesia declared
its independence after Japan's surrender, but it required four years
of intermittent negotiations, recurring hostilities, and UN
mediation before the Netherlands agreed to relinquish its colony.
Indonesia is the world's largest archipelagic state and home to the
world's largest Muslim population. Current issues include:
alleviating poverty, preventing terrorism, consolidating democracy
after four decades of authoritarianism, implementing financial
sector reforms, stemming corruption, holding the military and police
accountable for human rights violations, and controlling avian
influenza. In 2005, Indonesia reached a historic peace agreement
with armed separatists in Aceh, which led to democratic elections in
December 2006. Indonesia continues to face a low intensity
separatist movement in Papua.

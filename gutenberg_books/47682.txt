PREFACE.


[Illustration: I]n a few years Book-plate literature will have a place
in the catalogues of the Libraries, as it now has in those of the
dealers in books. The works of the Hon. J. Leicester Warren (Lord de
Tabley), Mr. Egerton Castle, and Mr. W. J. Hardy on the English plates,
Mr. Walter Hamilton, M. Henri Bouchot, and M. Poulet-Malassis on the
French, Herr Warnecke on the German, and M. Carlander on the Swedish,
are all the work of master hands, and are recognized as authorities. In
our own country the lists and essays of Mr. Richard C. Lichtenstein and
Mr. Laurence Hutton have long been of invaluable service, and occupy a
position both at home and abroad of undisputed eminence.

A large number of articles has also been contributed to periodical
literature by those well informed upon the subject, and numerous
monographs testify to the growth of interest in this fascinating study,
and by the names of their authors, to the class of scholars and students
of antiquarian lore who deem the humble book-plate worthy of their
attention.

In view of what has been and of what will be written, this present
modest attempt to introduce more fully than has yet been done, the
book-plates of America, needs to be understood as simply a pioneer work;
a great deal of information will reward the patient and painstaking
investigator of the future, which is now inaccessible, and without
doubt, too, much will be found even within the present to supplement
these pages.

This book could not have been undertaken nor carried to completion had
the writer been denied the generous assistance and hearty sympathy of
our collectors, to whom he desires to express his appreciation of the
kindnesses shown him.

Especially to Mr. R. C. Lichtenstein, Mr. E. N. Hewins, and Mr. Fred J.
Libbie of Boston, does he feel under deep obligation for the generous
loan of their splendid collections, for ready advice and counsel, for
cheerful assistance whenever asked for, and for that tangible sympathy
and lively interest which are worth so much to one engaged in such work.
To many others also is he indebted, both for the loan of plates and for
kindly words of encouragement.

To Mr. S. P. Avery, Mr. Beverly Chew, Mr. E. H. Bierstadt, Mr. Henry
Blackwell, Mr. D. McN. Stauffer, Mr. Edward D. Harris, Mr. Laurence
Hutton, and Mr. E. W. Nash, of New York City; to Mr. W. G. Brown of
Washington and Lee University at Lexington, Va.; Mr. H. E. Deats of
Flemington, N.J.; Dr. C. E. Clark of Lynn; Hon. W. A. Courtnay of
Charleston, S.C.; Miss Helen E. Brainerd of the Columbia College
Library; Mr. Pickering Dodge of Washington, D.C.; Mr. Charles T. Martin,
Mr. Frank B. Gay, Mr. A. C. Bates, and Mr. John C. Parsons, of
Hartford; Dr. Henry C. Eno of Saugatuck; Dr. J. H. Dubbs of Lancaster,
Penn., President of Franklin and Marshall College; Mr. D. V. R. Johnston
of the State Library at Albany; Mr. Nathaniel Paine of Worcester; Mr.
Daniel Ravenel of Charleston, S.C.; Mr. Howard Sill of Glendale, Md.;
Mr. R. A. Brock of Richmond, Va.; Mr. Howard Edwards of Philadelphia;
Dr. Swan M. Burnett of Washington, D.C.; Mr. Richard Wijnkoop of
Brooklyn; Mr. Bisbee of Dartmouth College; Mr. William Kelby of the New
York Historical Society; and to Mr. Lyon G. Tyler of Williamsburg, Va.,
President of William and Mary College, does he wish to make
acknowledgment for the favors which have contributed so much to the
value of the work. From over the sea, particularly kind assistance has
come from Rev. T. W. Carson, the veteran collector and eminent authority
of Dublin.

To all others who by letter, gift, or advice have assisted him, the
writer wishes hereby to make suitable and hearty acknowledgment.

The writer’s thanks are also extended to those who have so kindly
permitted him the use of their plates for the illustrating of the book.

A word more is due to Mr. E. N. Hewins, who very kindly, at the writer’s
request, accepted the labor of preparing the excellent Bibliography
which appears in the volume.

AMERICAN BOOK-PLATES.




INTRODUCTORY.


[Illustration: W]e cannot venture to guess which was the first
book-plate made in America, nor to say with absolute certainty whence
came the first plate used in our country; but undoubtedly the latter
came over already pasted into some book of a Dutch or English settler.

The larger part of our books came from England, and very few plates are
found with arms of other nationalities. The colonists who came from
England bringing books, brought also the home ideas concerning books,
and the book-plate was a natural piece of property to acquire. Their
descendants, who continued the connection with the mother-country, used
plates more generally, and the fashion spread naturally. It never became
very general, but was confined to those of gentle birth; the clergy, the
lawyers, and men of education. We shall see that it was not confined to
the men alone, but that the women of literary accomplishments also used
plates.

[Illustration: George Lee Turberville.

Virginia.]

By far the greater part of the plates are cut on copper, but there are
some woodcuts as will be seen in an examination of the list; also, there
are some which look as if cut in silver, which was an easier metal to
work, or perhaps in type-metal. One example is known in which brass was
used, and this old plate is now in the possession of the writer. The
steel engravings are of rather recent date; and while there are a number
of these, the new plates are mostly on copper. The simple labels are
printed from type.

The larger part of our early plates are armorial in character; and while
heraldry forms so prominent and important a feature, it is left
practically untouched in the present volume. The number interested in
the science is small, the authorities on coats-of-arms and on blazoning
differ, and the present writer had not the time to make the thorough
investigation necessary to a satisfactory treatment of this interesting
branch. Upon consultation with other collectors, and with their advice,
it was decided to leave this subject for a future volume should any call
for it arise.

[Illustration: Timothy Newell.]

A decided difference is noticed between the book-plates of the Northern
and the Southern Colonies. In the South, to which came men of wealth and
leisure with cultivated tastes, we would expect to find the little
superfluities and niceties of daily life sooner in vogue and more
generally used. Bringing books and musical instruments with them,
retaining their connection with the far-away home by correspondence and
visits, sending their sons to the great Universities to be educated, and
to the Law Schools for a finishing course, and ordering their clothes,
books, furniture, and all of the luxuries of life from England, they
would naturally be the first to use the book-plate. Very few of the
Southern plates were engraved by American engravers. They were nearly
all done in London, when some member of the family was over, or by order
from the Colony; for this reason the Southern plates are better in
heraldry, design, and execution than those of New England and New York.
They were the product of men experienced in such work; they were all
armorial and in the prevailing English mode.

The earliest comers to New England had a prejudice against coats-of-arms
and trinkets of such-like character, which their descendants, however,
soon forgot. Pride of ancestry and love of the display of aristocratic
claims developed when the hard circumstances of the former years had
worn off, and we find the prominent families of the North using
book-plates, and having their arms upon their coaches. In one important
feature, however, these Northern plates differ from the Southern,--they
are mostly the work of our native engravers, very few being done in
England.

The work of these native artisans, who were mostly self-taught in this
art of engraving on copper, is confessedly inferior to that of the
London experts found upon the Southern plates, both in drawing and
execution, but their work is of more value to the collector from this
very fact of their being American work. They furnish examples of native
skill, both in engraving and in copper-plate printing.

The ornamentation of buttons, spoons, tableware, and other articles of
silver was already practised when the demand for the book-plate arose,
so that there were skilful men ready to turn their attention to this new
branch of their art.

[Illustration: WILLIAM LORD]

The War of the Revolution naturally affected the native production of
book-plates, but a few years after its close, when Boston, New York, and
Philadelphia were active in publishing books, the engraver found work
more plenty, and very many who were employed upon the plates for the
illustration of books also produced book-plates.

Nathaniel Hurd was the principal engraver of book-plates in the North
before the war, though Thomas Johnson, who was born before him and who
also died before he did, made some plates, while Turner and Paul Revere
were also working at this period.

Henry Dawkins, in Philadelphia, came over from England, and so did the
elder Maverick, who made so many plates for the New Yorkers.

[Illustration: George C. M. Roberts, M.D.]

The literary plates are smaller in number than we could wish, and they
do not show a wide range of ideas either. Very probably some of the
designs were borrowed from English plates, and were produced over again
for different customers, or were freely copied by other engravers who
liked, or who found customers who liked, the design of others. The plate
used by _George Goodwin_ is one of four of this same design. The shelf
of books is also seen in the plate of _G. C. M. Roberts, M.D._, _Thomas
Robbins_, and the

[Illustration: MORAL LIBRARY

YALE COLLEGE]

_Elijah F. Reed_, which is a direct reproduction of the _Robbins_. Piles
of books, but not the regulation “Book-pile,” are seen in the _Brown_
and _Lewis_ plates, while the only real library interiors are the
_Tayloe_ plate, the _Moral Library_ and the _Village Library_
(Farmington, Conn.). John Allan, the old-book lover of New York, used a
plate with an open book against an anchor, and the plate of _Edmund
Penn_ shows a love for books in the dainty volumes disposed about the
frame.

[Illustration: Elijah F. Reed’s]

The patriotism of our book-lovers is shown in very many designs, which
use the American flag or the eagle. The thirteen stars also, the motto
of the United States, and various private mottoes of a very patriotic
nature, are frequently used.

It is noticeable that as compared with the Southern plates there are but
few of the Northern examples which give the address or residence of the
owner; that is, speaking of the armorial plates, the printed name
labels give these particulars quite often.

[Illustration: Jared Ingersoll Esq^{r}.

of New Haven Connecticut.]

The _Jared Ingersoll_ plate gives _New Haven_ as the residence of the
owner, while _Rhode Island_ follows the name on the plate of _Samuel
Elam_. Other Northern plates which are so engraved are the _Colonel
Eustace of New York_, _Comptroller Elliston_ also _of New York_, _Lenox
of Philadelphia_, _Atlee of Lancaster_, _John Franklin, Boston, New
England_, and _Robert Hale of Beverly_. Of the Southern plates,
_Wormeley_, _Waller_, _Tuberville_, _Tazewell_, _Skelton_, _Randolph_,
and _Ludwell_

[Illustration: John Walters Gibbs.]

give _Virginia_ as their residence; _Drayton_ names _South Carolina_,
the _Dr. Cabell_ plate names _Richmond_, and the _John Walters Gibbs_
names _Charleston, S.C._ The plates used in the West Indies also show
the residence quite often. There, too, as well as in the Southern
colonies, the profession or position of the owner, as well as the London
law school in which he was educated, are often given. Thus we have
_William Blanc, Middle Temple, Dominica_; _Chas. Pinfold, LL.D.,
Governor of Barbadoes_; _Peyton Randolph of the Middle Temple, London_;
_Francis Page of the Inner Temple Esqr._; _William Assheton of Gray’s
Inn_. In the Northern examples we find _John Gardiner of the Inner
Temple_, and _Jonathan Belcher, E Societate Medij Templi_.

[Illustration: PETER MIDDLETON. M.D.]

We note also in running through the List that the occupations most often
noted on the book-plates are those of the medical and the legal
profession. Barristers, lawyers, and attorneys are often so named, and
the initials _M.D._, or the full word _Doctor_, are seen.

The abbreviations of other degrees are found also, and the plates of
clergymen are not uncommon.

Several plates remain unnoticed in the following pages, which are
probably American, but which, for lack of positive information, it is
thought best not to include. Among these is an early Dutch plate which,
if it could be accurately traced to its original owner, might prove to
be one of the earliest plates used in America.

[Illustration: Harrison Gray Otis.]

It seems that a word is needed in defence of the perfectly legitimate
and gentle pursuit of collecting book-plates. A great deal of sarcasm
and indignation have found their way into the columns of periodical
literature, particularly in England, the especial purpose of which is to
trouble the humble collector, and to discredit him in the eyes of the
world. He is pointed out as a destroyer of valuable books, as an animal
so greedy in the pursuit of his insignificant prey as to ruin elegant
bindings that he may secure worthless bits of paper, and as actually so
devoid of good sense as to remove such of these as are interesting--for
it is reluctantly admitted that some interest does attach to the plates
used by certain men of fame in historical annals--from their rightful
place within the covers of the very books read and handled by these
illustrious owners.

[Illustration: Lieut. E. Trenchard]

Let it be remembered that but a small part of the many books published
have a permanent value, and that a book once eagerly sought may outlive
its usefulness, and come to have a commercial value of so much a pound
as old paper, instead of so much a copy in different styles of binding.
Surely, no one can quarrel with the collector who removes the
book-plate, found within it, from such a worn-out specimen, even if the
removal necessitates the ruin of the cover. But to remove a book-plate
does not necessarily mean to ruin the cover; it requires some skill and
considerable patience to remove a valuable plate without injury to
either itself or the cover upon which it was pasted, but it is done
daily. Surely no one can find fault with this--a skilful operation
resulting satisfactorily to the plate-collector and to the book-owner.

[Illustration: Samuel Elam.]

Again, no intelligent book-plate collector will separate the plate of a
famous man from the book which has been its home for years, and which
was once handled and read by its famous owner. Even a worthless book
will thus be saved by the collector, which was fit but for the fire or
the ash-heap, and which would have gone thither, plate and all, save for
his discriminating eye, while a valuable book no one would think of
despoiling. Would an intelligent collector, having a book from the
library of George Washington, with his plate upon the cover and his
autograph in its accustomed place, think of soaking off the plate and
cutting out the signature? Not at all; no matter how worthless the book
might chance to be, the fact that it was Washington’s is sufficient to
insure it from any harm, while the presence of the autograph and the
book-plate but adds to the value as establishing beyond peradventure the
original ownership.

The book-plate collector is naturally a book-lover. He must not be
accused or suspected of crimes against his own kith and kin. He is a
harmless and useful specimen of the _genus_ collector, who with
assiduity, perseverance, and intelligence seeks to preserve these
memorials of past days, which in the rage for indiscriminate collecting
were overlooked, and are but now beginning to receive the attention they
are worthy of.

It is, however, to be admitted that at first glance, the general reader
who has not developed a special liking for the things of the past in
history, art, or biography, may see no especial interest in book-plates.
But let him examine a collection of good plates with their intelligent
owner, who can point out to him the facts worthy of note; let him once
understand that celebrated artists like Albrecht Durer, Jost Amman,
William Hogarth, William Marshall, George Vertue, Bewick, Bartolozzi,
and even Raphael Morghen were willing to devote time and taste to the
designing or engraving of the book-plate; let him handle some of their
work, and reflect upon the effort the master considered so small a
design worthy of; let him see the plates of some of the noted names in
history, art, letters, medicine, the sciences, and the professions; let
him take in his hands the plates of William Penn, the friend of the
Indian and benefactor of his race, of Laurence Sterne, of David Garrick,
of Horace Walpole, of Samuel Rogers, of Charles Dickens, or of George
Washington, of John Adams, and Charles Carroll, signers of the
Declaration; let him see a plate engraved by Paul Revere whose services
in the Revolution he has known of from his schooldays;--let him see
these and scores more of similar interest, and he cannot fail to respond
to the enthusiasm of their owner. But indeed it is a pursuit, the
delights of which are discernible to those only who bring to it the
capacity for such pleasures.

NAME-LABELS AND MOTTOES.


[Illustration: O]f all forms of book-plates the simplest possible is the
printed name of the owner, unaccompanied by either motto, device, or
ornamentation of any kind. Such a plate had _Philip Hone_, one of the
founders of the Mercantile Library, and in the early twenties a mayor of
the city of New York. His plate is merely a bit of paper with his name
in bold script printed upon it from an engraved copper-plate.

This style of plate is not chronologically the earliest, but is taken as
our starting-point because of its unrelieved simplicity; this fulfils
the mission of the book-plate,--it proclaims the ownership of the book
in which it is seen; not in delicate language, to be sure, not with any
invitation to dip into the volume in hand, not with any evidence of the
owner’s taste in reading, but with a directness not to be misunderstood.

The essential part of the book-plate is the name of the owner; and while
this is sufficient of itself, it is found profitable and pleasant to
accompany it with an apt quotation from a favorite author, with a
caution against the improper

[Illustration: James Eddy Mauran.]

handling of books, with a warning of the sad result of declining
Wisdom’s guidance, or with an invitation to enjoy the beauties of
literature and to share the benefits of careful reading. In addition to
these mere typographical adjuncts an opportunity is offered for the
display of those more decorative garnishments which have led to the
development of the handsomer styles of plates.

[Illustration: _Hannah Reynolds._]

_Alexander Stedman’s: Thomas Thaxter’s, 1791: William W. Potter’s Book:
Aaron Woolworth’s, Ex Dono Rev. S. Buell, D.D._ These plates use the
possessive case, are embellished with borders of ornamental type, and
supply some further information by showing the date of their being used,
or by naming the giver of the volumes. Other styles of expressing
book-ownership are afforded by the following: _Nicolas Pike His Book
1768_: _Hannah Adams, Medfield 179-_: _The Property of John Clap,
Roxbury 1791_: _Davidis Dickinson Liber, A.D. 1796_: _Lieut. E.
Trenchard, U. S. Navy_: _Simeon Baldwin, Owner_: _Ex Libris I. G.
Thomas_: _Library T. W. Curtis, No._: _Belonging to the Library of
Thomas Forrest Betton, Germantown Pa._: _The Property of John Weld
native of Pomfret, Conn. Resident of Pomfret, Bo’t of Mr. James Steele
of Hartford, January 12, 1796_: _W. Lewis, Ejus Liber_: _Johann
Christoph Kunze, Prediger in Philadelphia_: _Emmanuel Jones e Coll; Gul;
et Ma: 1756_.

[Illustration: THOMÆ HOLT.]

These old type-set labels with their quaint borders of ornamental
type,--scrolls, flourishes, stars, vines, and even grammatical
signs,--are usually found to be printed on good white handmade paper,
which was seldom trimmed with care; occasionally a tinted paper is
found,--yellow more often than any other, but sometimes a blue or green;
these served the less pretentious of our ancestors in lieu of the
coats-of-arms and family mottoes of those of higher lineage, and are
found in quantities throughout the New England and Middle States: even
farther south they are not uncommon, but are not so numerous.

[Illustration: JOHN CAMPBELL,

Charles County.]

In making up these ornamental borders the type was usually set in the
form of a parallelogram, occasionally in a square, oval, circle, or
diamond, and seldom in fanciful shapes. The most ambitious plate of this
kind which has come under my observation is that which once graced the
books of Mary McGinley; this is a rather large plate, and the type is
set in the form of an urn, within the lines of which are given the motto
and the owner’s name.

A step in advance of these wholly typographical examples are those which
employ a woodcut border to surround the name, and instances can be
given of such a border enclosing the name printed from type; festoons of
flowers or of cord, and draperies of cloth, were also used as a simple
setting for the owner’s name. In this connection mention may be made of
the work of T. Sparrow, an obscure engraver of Maryland; no heraldic or
pictorial examples of his workmanship have been identified, and he
probably confined himself to the simple woodcut designs of which but a
small number are known. Always using a border of floriated scrolls, he
never omitted an original contrivance which is the characteristic mark
of his work,--a group of thirteen stars surrounded often by a wreath.
This is always found in a prominent place, and is an indication of his
patriotism as well as that of the owner of the plate.

[Illustration: RICHARD SPRIGG, jun.]

It must not be supposed that the heraldic book-plate was an outgrowth or
development of the name-label: not at all; they were contemporaneous
and were both used in England long before they were here.

Coming now to the subject of mottoes, we find a wide field to travel
over, many languages to read, many quotations to recognize, with hints
and warnings, and even threatenings, by the score, from jealous
book-lovers. Mottoes readily fall into two classes: those which are
chosen by the owner for some personal reason, and those which are family
mottoes, and which are used without thought because they are a family
inheritance, or with a commendable pride in such legacies from an
honorable ancestry. Latin is the language most often used probably,
though English is a strong rival, while German, French, Greek, and even
Hebrew and Welsh are also found upon our book-plates. Sentiments
opposing the habit of book-borrowing are of frequent occurrence, and in
some instances are of such severity as to leave no doubt of their
effectiveness. For brevity and pointedness the following example can
hardly be exceeded:--

    _This book was bought and paid for by_
            _D. C. Colesworthy._
    _Borrowing neighbors are recommended_
    _to supply themselves in the same manner._
    _Price seventy-five cents._

On the book-plate of _D. W. Jayne_ the following verse from the Bible is
used:--

     _Go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves. Matt. Chap.
     xxv. ver. 9._

[Illustration: Thomas O. Selfridge,

_BOSTON_,

1799.]

Verses from Holy Writ are quite frequently used on plates, and the style
of expression found in the Psalms and Proverbs is borrowed as adding an
authoritative emphasis to the words of caution and advice,--

     _The wicked borrow, and returneth not: do thou not like unto them._

     _Return what thou borroweth with the most sacred punctuality, and
     withhold it not._

On the plate of a book-lover in Charleston, S.C.,--

     _And ye shall keep me until the fourteenth day. And it shall be
     when thou hast made an end of reading this book. Send me away unto
     my master. Ex. xii. 6: Jer. li. 63: Gen. xxiv. 54._

[Illustration: THE PROPERTY OF THE

Worcester Circulating Library Company.]

Every one has suffered from book-borrowers, even from school-day times,
when the rude doggerel,--

    _Steal not this book for fear of shame,_
    _For here you see the owner’s name_,

or its variant,

    _Steal not this book for fear of strife,_
    _For its owner carries a huge jack-knife_,

was printed in coarse letters across the cover of the books most likely
to go astray. How irritating it is to find the very volume one needs at
the moment, missing from its accustomed place on the shelf; if anything
is lacking to complete the torment of the discovery, let it be
impossible to find out who has taken the desired volume, or to get any
clew as to when it went or where!

     _Private Library of J. N. Candee Cole, This book is not loaned.
     Matt. xxv. 9._

     _Read not books alone: but men, and be careful to read thyself. The
     property of John Lambert, South Reading._

                        _To Borrowers of Books._
    YOU _remember, my friend, I freely comply’d
    With the favour you asked me, and fully relied
    On a favour from you, which, tho’ promised, I find,
    As it hasn’t been granted, is out of your mind,
    To return in due time what I’ve wanted to see,
    The Book, which ’tis long since you borrow’d of me.
    Another I now with reluctance implore,
    ’Tis only to ask that you borrow no more._

     _Stolen from J. W. Houx_,

                 _Book-keeping taught in three words,
                           Never lend them._

The would-be borrower who finds these sentiments in the book he was
about to ask for will scarcely be encouraged to do so, and for
directness they are exceeded by only one example, in which the owner’s
name is followed by the simple declaration, _He does not lend books_.
The motto on the plate of the late _George Ticknor_--_Suum cuique, To
every man his own_--was also calculated to discourage the borrower.

But some people do lend books, and have them returned too,--in good
second-hand condition. And so it comes about that the proper use of
books is made the subject of another class of mottoes.

    _My Friend! Should you this book peruse,_
    _Please to protect it from abuse:_
    _Nor soil, nor stain, nor mark its page,_
    _Nor give it premature old age:_
    _And, when it has effected all,_
    _Please to return it ere I call._

[Illustration: Daniel Greenleaf]

The following verse is common property and is found on several plates:--

    _If thou art borrowed by a friend,_
      _Right welcome shall he be_
    _To read, to study, not to lend,_
      _And to return to me._

    _Not that imparted learning doth_
      _Diminish learning’s store,_
    _But books, I find, if often lent,_
      _Return to me no more._

    _Read slowly,_
    _Pause frequently,_
    _Think seriously,_
    _Return duly with the corners of the leaves not turned down._

    _Neither blemish this book, nor the leaves double down,_
    _Nor lend it to each idle friend in the town:_
    _Return it when read,--or if lost please supply_
    _Another, as good to the mind and the eye._
    _With right and with reason you need but be friends_
    _And each book in my study your pleasure attends._

    _If through respect or love I lend_
    _This book unto my worthy friend,_
    _He must not soil, abuse, nor tear,_
    _But read with diligence and care;_
    _And when its contents you have learned,_
    _Remember, it must be_ RETURNED.

On the plate of _Samuel W. Francis_ appear the following lines:--

    _Any one may borrow,_
    _But a gentleman returns._

           *       *       *       *       *

    _The property_
    _of_
    _Thomas C. Cowan._

    _Borrower,_
    _read, mark, and_ AVOID
    _the former part_
    _of_
    _Psalm xxxvii. 21_.

           *       *       *       *       *

    IF _you borrow, freely use it,_
    _Take great care and don’t abuse it:_
    _Read, but neither lose nor lend it,_
    _Then unto the owner send it_.

     _Never open a book farther than to bring both sides of the cover on
     to the same plane. Never lend a borrowed book, but return it as
     soon as you are through with it, so that the owner may not be
     deprived of its use. You may think this a strange request, but I
     find that although many of my friends are poor arithmeticians, they
     are nearly all of them good book-keepers._

[Illustration: TIMOTHY MANN.]

In strong contrast to all the preceding are those mottoes of generous
souls who find no pleasure in withholding their treasures, but who wish
to have it understood that they are for the use of all; not very many
are bold enough to thus advertise their willingness to lend, but a few
do so, and generally by the use of the Latin, _Sibi et amicis_, or _et
amicorum_.

Sentiments in praise of books and reading are not uncommon, and
quotations from classic writers both in prose and poetry do good
service on book-plates. Pope’s well-known lines--

    _A little learning is a dangerous thing,_
    _Drink deep or taste not the Pierian Spring;_
    _Where shallow draughts intoxicate the brain,_
    _But drinking largely sobers us again._

are found on an old American plate.

On a recent New York plate,--

     _Far more seemly were it for thee to have thy Study full of Books
     than thy purse full of money. Lilly._

On a Maine plate,--

    _Who learns and learns but does not what he learns,_
    _Is one who plows and plows but never sows._

           *       *       *       *       *

    _Weigh well each thought, each sentence freely scan,_
    _In Reason’s balance try the works of man._
    _Be bias’d not by those who praise or blame,_
    _Nor, Servile, Yield opinion to a name._

On a recent Boston plate,--

    _Un bon livre est un bon ami._

On a recent Western plate,--

    _A jolly goode booke,_
    _Whereon to looke,_
    _Is better to me than golde._

On a recent Washington plate,--

     _A trusty villain, sir, that very oft when I am dull with care and
     melancholy lightens my humour._

[Illustration: EX LIBRIS A. L. HOLLINGSWORTH.]

The mottoes on the plates of those who have achieved distinction have a
peculiar interest, especially when chosen by the owners themselves. The
plate of _Henry W. Longfellow_ bears the following line:--

    _Non clamor sed amor_,

which is from an unknown author and is found in the following verse:--

    _Non vox sed votum,_
    _Non chordas sed cor,_
    _Non clamor sed amor,_
    _Sonat in aure Dei._

    _Not voice but vow,_
    _Not harp-string, but heart-string,_
    _Not loudness but love,_
    _Sound in the ear of God._

The motto of _George Washington_,--_Exitus acta probat_, is not given in
the accepted lists as the family motto of his ancestors, but it may have
been such. The meaning of it has brought out criticism recently because
of its Jesuitical sound,--“_The end shows the deed_.” But this may also
be taken as a patriotic utterance in view of the part of the illustrious
owner of this plate in the Revolution.

On the plate of _William Penn_ we see a motto most fitting for the
character he sustained, _Dum clavum rectum teneam_--“_While I hold to
glory, let me hold to right_.” In the plate the third word is omitted,
as the engraver found the motto too long for the space reserved, and
through some

[Illustration: George Bancroft]

blunder the _r_ in _clarum_ is changed to a _v_, which makes no sense at
all.

On the plate of _George Bancroft_, the late historian, a chubby cherub
bears a panel on which is the motto, _Sursum corda_. Another plate was
also used by Mr. Bancroft which was in all respects like the above,
except that the motto was changed to ΕΙΣ ΦΑΟΣ.

The plate of the late _Mr. George W. Childs_ has the following motto
whose appropriateness is evident at once,--_The pen is mightier than the
sword_. Above this a second motto of equal appropriateness is
given,--_Nihil sine labore_.

On the plate of _Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes_, _Per ampliora ad altiora_
is given upon a ribbon under a beautiful drawing of the “chambered
nautilus.”

[Illustration: WILLIAM PRESCOTT]

Instances of mottoes which are cleverly made to carry some meaning, or
some word, which will be seen at a glance to be taken from the name of
the owner, are found often.

On the plate of _Harold Clarence Ernst_ this motto is given, _Ernst ist
das Leben_.

On the plate of _George Curry, D.D._,--_Sic curre capias_.

On the plate of _Edward Spencer Dix_,--_Quod dixi id feci_.

[Illustration: HENRY BLACKWELL]

In concluding this list of mottoes two from the Welsh can be instanced,
one on the plate of a New York collector of Welshiana, which is _Cared
Doeth Yr Encilic_, meaning, “_The learned love the things of the
past_.” The other is on a Washington plate, and reads thus, _A fynno Dwy
y Fydd_, meaning, “_What God wills, will be_.”

In the list of languages used on book-plates, we must now include the
Volapük, for we have the first instance of its use already in a New York
plate; the motto reading, _Menad bal pukbal_, and meaning, “_One
humanity, one language_.”

ARMORIAL BOOK-PLATES.


[Illustration: B]ook-plates admit of many kinds of extraneous
ornamentation, and wholly apart from the special function of recording
the ownership of books, they serve as expressions of artistic taste;
they lend themselves readily to many forms of design, and have passed
through several changes or “styles” in the three hundred years of their
existence; they can be dignified or flippant, serious or punning, of
artistic beauty or positive deformity; they can express the owner’s
choice of reading and can preserve lines from his favorite authors; can
convey warning or invitation, and can, in short, be made a very personal
affair.

The first book-plates were heraldic. In those early and, in some senses,
good old days, before the schoolmaster was abroad in the land, when
learning was the possession of the aristocrats and the churchmen only,
and consequently when handwriting was not in use among the people,
families were distinguished by emblems which were known of all. These
heraldic devices were painted on their shields, carved upon their
walls, engraved upon their breast-plates, woven upon their banners and
their tapestries, displayed upon their own persons, upon those of their
dependents, and even upon their animals and the furniture and books of
their homes; even the purely ornamental and ephemeral luxuries came to
be adorned with the family coat-of-arms.

[Illustration: Gabriel Jones, Attorney at Law, in Virginia.]

The armorial bearings, stamped upon the back or sides of a book, or
printed upon paper and pasted within the cover, were sufficient, without
a name, to identify the family to which it belonged. Libraries descended
from father to son, and were kept intact for generations; and the
family arms and motto were the most appropriate label possible.

Warren, one of the first to study book-plates and to give to others the
benefit of his researches, has divided the armorial plates into general
classes, and has given them suitable names, which are accepted the world
over. A considerable number of subdivisions has been made; and while
they may be serviceable where book-plates are plentiful, they are
but an incumbrance to the collector of the early plates of America,
for our examples are few in number, and are quite sufficiently
distinguished--for the purpose of the present work, at least--by the
following styles: Early English, Jacobean, Chippendale, Ribbon, and
Wreath. Distinctive, easily remembered characteristics pertain to each
of these, and fairly accurate dates of their adoption and continuance
can be given.

Adopting then the nomenclature of Warren, and following his lead, we
come now to consider the meaning of the different styles and the
diversity of their designs.

The very earliest class is the Early English, in which the shield of
arms is present with all its accessories. In these plates the mantling
is very profuse, and in large full-rounded curves surrounds three, and
often all four, sides of the shield. This is the only ornamentation,
nothing incidental being added as yet; the name of the owner is usually
or often accompanied by a title and address, and quite frequently also
by the date.

[Illustration: Joseph Dudley

1754]

We have but few examples of this style; perhaps the most satisfactory as
an example of the class will be the plate of _Joseph Dudley_, dated
1754. (This plate was really engraved much earlier than this. Hurd
erased the original name, and cut the present one with the date in its
place.) In this the mantling, running out beyond the edges of the
shield, curls both upward and downward, and completely envelops three
sides; the design takes on a strong resemblance to oak leaves, and a
single leaf of this is engraved upon the helmet: the background, or
space enclosed within the scroll-work, is filled in with perpendicular
lines which might be taken for the tincture _gules_; in the
name-bracket, the oak-leaf pattern is again made use of, forming a neat
finish to the ends.

[Illustration: Jer. Dummer

Anglus Americanus]

In the plate of _The Honourable Wm. Carmichael, Esqr._, the mantling is
not so completely transformed into the oak-leaf design, although the
latter is here apparent. The plate of _Jer. Dummer, Anglus Americanus_
is peculiar in that the space enclosed by the scroll-work is lined with
the solid brick wall of the later Jacobean style; in this the

[Illustration: Minot]

mantling is less striking than in the _Dudley_, but it surrounds the
shield well, and curves upward about the crest. In the _Minot_ plate,
which is very peculiar and rather difficult to classify, the mantling is
very unworthy of the name; it does not proceed from the helmet, nor
indeed from anywhere in particular, but in wild and very eccentric
fashion, envelops the crest and most of the shield; the field of the
shield is tinctured _azure_, and it is enclosed within a border or
moulding which nearly surrounds it, but leaves a portion at the base
unprotected; a further peculiarity of this moulding is that it is an
integral part of the helmet, for it curves over at the top of the shield
and actually proceeds from the helmet.

A very fine example of this style is the _Francis Page_ plate.

The next style is the Jacobean, commonly spoken of as existing from
about 1700 to about 1745; the styles overlap naturally, and no
hard-and-fast period can be established within which only one particular
style of plate was used. Examples of the Jacobean plate are found in
England which would date later than 1745, and the style which succeeded
this was used somewhat before the year which begins its accepted period:
the dates of the periods, then, are approximate. The names by which the
different styles are known have all a good reason for their acceptance,
although each one was suggested by differing circumstances.

The style of book-plate in vogue at the time of the last James is
designated as Jacobean; and, while it continued in use long after the
death of the deposed monarch who gave it its name, any change in its
designation would be misleading. The principal features of this style
are its heavy, carved appearance, the evenly balanced proportions, and
the exact coincidence of the two sides of the design. The shield, always
of regular outline, is usually placed upon an ornamental frame whose
background, or lining, is either filled in

[Illustration: _FREDERIK·PHILIPSE ESQ^{r}._]

with a fish-scale pattern, diapered into the lozenge form or built up
solidly with a wall of brick. This lining shows at both sides of the
shield, below, and, less often, above it; its sides are convoluted; they
run out in foldings and scrolls resembling the carving on wood, and are
often worked into elaborate patterns: sometimes, too, the design is
surrounded by a carved moulding which makes a heavy frame of rectangular
form and massive appearance. This style of plate, well-handled, is
exceedingly handsome, and is capable of more repose and dignity than any
other. Very forbidding indeed, and over-solemn, are some examples, but
in the main the purely Jacobean plates are very pleasing. Among the
accessories usually found are a scallop-shell with the concave side
turned towards the observer, and placed either below the shield to
support it, or above it to set it off: this shell is always looked for
in the Jacobean plates, and indeed a shelly motive is apparent
throughout very many examples. The helmet and mantling are conspicuous,
especially the latter, as it is often enlarged and emphasized by being
drawn into the general scheme of decoration; very full, reaching far
down the sides of the shield-frame, and indeed often curiously woven
into the convolutions of the frame itself, it at times loses its
significance: grotesque faces sometimes peer from the ornamentation, and
heads of satyrs and demons are frequently used to rest the base of the
shield upon. In some instances the name is placed upon a bracket similar
to the upper part of the plate in decoration, or, again, it may be seen
upon a small curtain or lambrequin caught up at the ends with string.
Very often, too, no setting is provided for the name, and it is simply
engraved beneath the design. Eagles, lions, termini, cherubs, and
sometimes cornucopiæ of fruit or flowers, angels blowing upon trumpets,
and stiff stalks of flowers are introduced into the ornamentation. But
these do not succeed in enlivening the style of the plate materially,
for it is essentially heavy, conservative, and formal in design and
spirit. No graceful airiness rests upon it, and it provokes no joyous
sentiment, but rather rouses respect and enforces stateliness. The
general appearance of the Jacobean plate is as if carved from wood. We
do not expect old carving to be anything but solid and immobile, and
these characteristics are present in this style of book-plate. Indeed,
Warren, in his chapter on the Jacobean style, says that no antiquary can
fail to note the strong similarity of treatment and design between the
wood-carving preserved in the churches of the time of Charles the Second
and the mouldings on the monuments of the same period, and the
book-plates of the style we have considered. Our finest example of the
Jacobean book-plate is found in the work of Thomas Johnston, who made
the plate of _William P. Smith, A.M._ This is a typical example of the
later Jacobean style, and is worthy of particular study. The Elizabethan
shield is set against a frame which is very elaborately carved and
ornamented; the lining is covered with the fish-scale pattern, and this
extends also to the arms and convolutions upon the sides. At the base of
the shield the scallop-shell is in position as prescribed, and is
surrounded by a little frame of its own; the mantling is very slight
indeed, breaking out from the wreath and also from the lower part of the
helmet, in short and simple spirals. The motto is found on a ribbon
which is gracefully strung upon the scrolls at the bottom of the design.

In the _Spooner_ plate, by Hurd, the shield, also of Elizabethan
pattern, is set against a diapered background; beneath the shield,
within a little frame, the head of a sphinx is seen; term-figures are
placed in the scroll-work at either side, and from their hands depend
bouquets of flowers;

[Illustration: William P Smith AM]

the crest is overarched with a bit of old scallop-shell, and the motto
is given on a plain ribbon which, wholly unsupported, maintains a curved
position under the whole design. In the _Andrew Tyler_ plate, also by
Hurd, a grotesque face supports the shield, the lining is elaborately
diapered, and a festoon of cloth depends from the lower scrolls of the
frame. In the small-sized plate of _John Allen_, the lining is
embellished with the simple lattice-work, in two patterns.

[Illustration: ANDREW TYLER]

[Illustration: Jacob Sargeant.]

[Illustration: John Durand Esq.]

Closely succeeding the Jacobean, and indeed coming into use before the
latter was wholly discarded, the Chippendale style of book-plate may be
regarded as in a way an evolution from the Jacobean. If the parent was
dignified and conservative, the offspring was dainty and progressive;
the Jacobean style maintained its dignity and decorous nicety to the
end, but the Chippendale, which started in with a taking air of modest
and light gracefulness, in strong and pleasing contrast to the solidity
of its predecessor, rapidly assumed a most elaborate and ornate manner,
and finally sank into a wild, riotous, and well-nigh sensuous profusion
of decorative expression, which being too heavy for it to sustain, bore
it down to its end. The character of the Chippendale plate, while
attractive and beautiful in its pure form, had essential elements of
weakness, which, hardly able to resist development, were certain to
cause its downfall.

[Illustration: Anthony Stewart

Annapolis Maryland]

[Illustration: Myles Cooper _LL·D_]

As is natural to suppose, the name was bestowed upon this style because
of its assimilation of the ornate and flowery spirit which the famous T.
Chippendale at this period introduced into wood-carving and upholstery.
As compared with its immediate predecessor, the differences in this
style of plate are seen to be principally the liberating of the
decorative features from the stiffness which thralled them in the
Jacobean. Not now resembling ponderous carvings in oak and mahogany, but
rising free and unrestrained, the rose branches and sprigs seem to be
copied from Nature herself; not arranged with careful nicety and labored
uniformity as formerly, but springing from any convenient niche, they
add grace and delicacy to the whole design. The helmet is seldom

[Illustration: Andrew Oliver]

seen in this style of plate, the mantling is consequently absent, and
the bracket supporting the shield of arms undergoes a transformation;
the convolutions and scrolls on the sides become finer, freer, and less
imposing; the shield is never found of any set rectangular pattern, but
often is pear-shaped, shell-like in form, or indeed not unlike the
oyster or the human ear in general outline; the scallop shell which
formerly served as a base for the shield to rest on, is now broken into
dainty fragments with the pectinated edges disposed about the shield
itself; the name-frame is no longer a cloth curtain, but is a scroll
with indented edges and curling outlines.

[Illustration: Benj Kissam]

In its highest development the Chippendale plate is a beautiful piece of
work; the richness of its curves, its plentitude of graceful scrolls,
its profusion of roses in garlands or on the stem, and the elaborate
detail noticeable in all its parts, combine to make a plate of
delightful airiness and dainty nicety; but in the hands of weak
designers, as pointed out by Warren, its possibilities of
over-ornamentation were seized upon, and we find the most unexpected and
incongruous assortment of figures from life, architectural fragments,
allegorical subjects and other features not to be included in any
particular class, occupying convenient places about the escutcheon; we
find sleek shepherds clad in the fashionable clothes of the
day,--knee-breeches, ruffled shirt with Byron collar, large felt hats,
and buckled shoes; we see would-be shepherdesses in big hooped-skirts,
very low-necked bodices and slight waists, wearing frizzly hair and
Gainsborough hats, and carrying dainty crooks; scantily draped figures
recline under the trees, while attendant cupids make music or hasten up
with books. Turning from these pastoral scenes, we come across plates
which have a most frightful dragon with scaly body, forked tail, and
fiery, bulging eyes, who spits fire as he crouches among the roses; in
others we find cornices, columns, arches, and urns; fountains,
hand-glasses, ships, nautical instruments, lambs, dogs,--in short, it is
useless to name the great number of irrelevant articles which were made
use of. The plate was made to carry any amount of heterogeneous
ornamentation which the designer fancied; it seems in some cases as if
the details were employed with rightful reference to the tastes or
pursuits of the owner, but in the greater number the fancy was allowed
free play.

Hurd’s work furnishes us with the best examples

[Illustration: Peter Manigault of the Inner Temple, Barister at Law

[Illustration: Samuel Vaughan Esq.^{r}]

of the pure Chippendale style; the _Chandler_ plate, the _Wentworth_,
and the _Dumeresque_ are good examples; Dawkins gives us the later and
debased Chippendale with all its profusion of extrinsic ornamentation.
The _Samuel Vaughan_ plate is a very fine example of good
Chippendaleism, and may be taken as a standard by which to recognize the
features of this style. The _Robt. Dinwiddie_ plate is a fine example of
this style, though the heraldry may be questioned: this, according to
Hardy, is of Scotch make.

[Illustration: W. Jackson]

In the Ribbon and Wreath style, which came into vogue in England about
1770, and in the United States not much before 1790, we note a return to
simplicity. The later Chippendale plates, with their over-burdened
frames, now yield to this quiet style, which is unassuming and very
pleasing. In this the shield is usually

[Illustration: JOHN WILLIAMS _ESQ.^R_]

[Illustration: John Williams]

[Illustration: DeWitt Clinton.]

heart-shaped, is not set against a background, and has absolutely no
carved work about it; the shield is often unsupported, but is sometimes
hung by ribbons or festoons from wall-pins above; the decoration, as the
name suggests, consists principally of ribbons, and wreathing in various
forms. At the present day we use in our wall-paper, upholstery, and
wood-carving on furniture and mantels, and even on outside cornices, a
certain form of garland or festoon tied with ribbon which we call
“Colonial”; in a general way this resembles the decoration features of
the Ribbon and Wreath book-plate. From wall-pins with fancy oval or
round heads, festoons of flowers depend above the shield; branches of
holly and palm, often tied with a ribbon whose fluttering ends bear a
motto or the name, are crossed beneath the shield, and their graceful
sprays extend up either side. Some of the festoons are rich with
blossoms, others, more slender, are of leaves only, while a few are made
of cloth; the full garlands are usually hung from above the shield,
while the thinner style is draped in any place and manner acceptable to
the designer, and with more or less of gracefulness, as his skill
permitted. This style of plate calls for nothing more than its
legitimate features to render it effective and satisfactory, and in
general the plates are in the pure style; but in some of the New York
plates, there are books, writing materials, and bits of landscape
introduced under the shield.

The _Thomas Johnston_ plate by Maverick is a fine example of this style.
Maverick was the most prolific worker in the Ribbon and Wreath, while
Callender and Rollinson also used it very largely. The _Prosper Wetmore_
plate by Maverick, the _John Sullivan_ by Callender, and the _Horatio
Shepherd Moat_ by Rollinson, are all excellent examples.

PICTORIAL AND ALLEGORICAL BOOK-PLATES, AND PLATES OF COLLEGES,
LIBRARIES, AND SOCIETIES.


[Illustration: D]esigns which are wholly pictorial or which are meant to
convey meaning by their symbolism are not very numerous with us. This
style of design is no better suited to the plates of public libraries,
schools, and societies, than to those of individuals, but nearly all of
our early examples of this style are found to belong to the former
class.

One of the early personal plates of this kind is that of _James Parker_,
who was a collector of curios, medals, and books. He was a conductor on
the old Western Railroad, and ran the first train between Worcester and
Springfield. This plate is fully described in the List.

Of an entirely different style is the plate engraved by Harris for
_Henry Andrews_. This is pictorial, introducing classical features, but
hardly rising to the height of allegory. The plate of _Bloomfield
McIlvaine_ is also pictorial, and probably allegorical, as the figure
seems to represent History. In the _Samuel Parker_ plate we have

[Illustration: No. 161, Sam Parker]

allegory with a label to identify it; for the bank on which the muse of
History reclines is labelled _Clio_. A very peculiar pictorial plate is
that of _Edward Pennington_, which seems to represent an overflowing
reservoir.

[Illustration: HENRY ANDREWS]

The plates of _McMurtrie_, _Kip_, _Mann_, _Russell_, _Swett_ and
_Hooper_ are good examples of the class. Examples could be given at
greater length, but as all are carefully described in the List, the
reader is referred to it.

The most interesting of the old society and

[Illustration: NEW·YORK _Society_ LIBRARY.]

[Illustration: NEW-YORK SOCIETY LIBRARY. 1789]

library plates are the three of the _New York Society Library_, the two
of the libraries in Farmington, Conn., and that of the _Society for
Propagating the Gospel in Foreign Parts_.

In the plates of the _Society Library_ allegory is rampant. Minerva
appears in all of them, and in the two by Maverick is the principal
figure. In both of these she appears to an American Indian, whose
attitude shows his deep appreciation of the benefits of education as
offered by the resplendent goddess. In one case she is represented as
having just arrived from Olympus, and is still encircled by clouds; in
the other, she seems quite at home in the alcove of the library, and has
taken a suitable volume from the shelf for the use of the savage. In the
plate by Gallaudet for this library the allegory is extended, and other
prominent inhabitants of the abode of the celestials are present. The
arts and sciences which the books of the library treat of are
represented by implements and symbols easily recognized.

The plate of the _Monthly Library in Farmington_ also uses allegory. The
designer and engraver of this plate was Martin Bull, an old deacon in
the village, who was quite an interesting man. He was a goldsmith, a
maker of silver buttons, and spoons; a manufacturer of saltpetre when
needed by the army, a conductor of church music, town treasurer for
eight years, clerk of probate for thirty-nine years, a strong patriot,
and a writer of long and appallingly solemn letters to the youth of the
village when

[Illustration:

at college. The library was founded in 1795,--about as soon as our
soldier-citizens could settle down into reading stay-at-homes,--and was
conducted upon the plan of monthly exchanges. On the first Sabbath of
the month all members would assemble in the evening and pass in their
books and receive others, the choice being auctioned off. Two dollars
and a half a month was thus realized, and the meeting was the event of
the month to the sturdy inhabitants of the quiet town, to say nothing of
the younger folk, to whom it must have afforded coveted opportunities
for pleasant meetings, and quiet walks along the lanes. On the first day
of the new century, January, 1801, the library changed its name to that
which appears upon the book-plate, and on which the good deacon
exhibited a specimen of his highest art. Previously to this date it had
gone under the name of “The Library in the First Society in Farmington,”
and its first book-plate, probably engraved by the good deacon, had the
simple name with no pictorial accessories.

Contemporaneously with this, another library called the _Village
Library_, was in operation, and continued until 1826, when it was merged
with a third. This library also had a book-plate, but it was undoubtedly
beyond the powers of the engraver of its forerunners. In this we see the
interior of a room, in which a young lady patron of the library is
storing her mind with those choice axioms which, if put in practice, far
exceed the attractiveness of mere personal beauty; so says the couplet
beneath the picture.

[Illustration: VILLAGE LIBRARY.]

    _Beauties in vain their pretty eyes may roll:_
    _Charms strike the sense, but merit wins the soul._

The plate of the _Society for Propagating the Gospel in Foreign Parts_
is also pictorial, and represents a ship of the Society, with its
missionary, approaching the shore of savage America: this plate is dated
1704, and is very curious and interesting. The society grew from the
efforts of one Rev. Thomas Bray, who established thirty-nine parochial
libraries in the American Colonies for the purpose of propagating the
doctrines

[Illustration: The Gift of the Society for propagating the Gospell in
Foreign parts, 1784]

of the Church. In 1698, King’s Chapel, Boston, received some two hundred
books from this society, which were described as “an arsenal of sound
theological, ecclesiastical, and political doctrines for the Ministers
of His Majesty’s Chapel.” For the prevention of loss or embezzlement,
and that they might be known wherever

[Illustration: SOCIAL LAW LIBRARY Boston.]

found, “in every book, on the inside cover shall be these words, ‘Sub
auspiciis Wilhelmi III,’ and also the Library to which they belong, thus
‘E Bibliotheca Bostoniana.’” This must have been in addition to the
plate we are considering, as no words descriptive of particular
ownership are given: possibly this plate was used in all the books
belonging to the society, and the supplementary one was for use in each
individual library.

College plates are as a general thing very plain, but the plates used by
the societies supported by the students and the alumni, are often very
elaborate. The early societies in Harvard and in Yale had curious and
very interesting examples of the allegorical and symbolic plate.

The _Hasty Pudding Society_ and the _Porcellian Club_ of Harvard
College, the _Linonian Society_ and the _Brothers in Unity_ of Yale
College, are examples. In Dartmouth College, the _Social Friends
Society_, and in the smaller colleges numerous other fraternities and
societies, used plates of simpler style.

The books of the Library of Harvard College were marked with plates by
Hurd and Bowen, as noted in the list; on these plates, the gifts of
various benefactors are recorded, with the class to which they belonged,
conditions regarding the gift of the books, or a statement of the fund
from whose income the money for the books is derived.

The plate of the _Library of Congress_ is an engraved label having the
name and spaces for

[Illustration]

[Illustration: LINONIAN LIBRARY YALE COLLEGE]

entries surrounded by a border of oak leaves and acorns: the design is
very neat, and is old in appearance.

A very beautiful plate is used by some _Orphan Asylum_, which does not
give its full name upon its plate. In this a beautiful picture of the
Christ blessing the little ones is given; the line “Forasmuch as ye did
it unto one of the least of these, ye did it unto Me,” is given under
the vignette.

[Illustration: Linonian Library]

In the plate of the _Library of the New York State Agricultural
Society_, which was incorporated in 1832, Ceres is seen in the field;
behind her the sheaves of wheat extend in rows; one arm clasps a
cornucopia, and with the hand of the other she extends a wreath.

In a great many instances the plates of libraries had no pictorial
features, or indeed anything at all ornamental, being but the printed
rules governing the users of the books. Two examples of this kind of
plate are given below.

                             _This VOLUME_
                             _belongs to_
                             _PRICHARD’S_
                        _Circulating Library_,
               _Containing nearly Two Thousand Volumes_,
                    _In Market Street, Baltimore_,
                                _where_
                         _LADIES OR GENTLEMEN_
                             _may become_
                               _READERS_
           _By subscribing for one Month, three Months or by

          very great Variety of NEW and OLD BOOKS for Sale._
                            _He, likewise_,
              _Gives Ready Money for New and Old Books_.

                   *       *       *       *       *

                      _Union Circulating Library,

_Subscribers to pay in advance, six dollars for a year: three dollars
and fifty cents for six months: two dollars for three months: one dollar
for one month: each subscriber to have three Duodecimo volumes, or one
Octavo and one Duodecimo at a time. A subscriber detaining an Octavo
longer than four weeks or a Duodecimo longer than two weeks to pay as a
non-subscriber. For each Octavo one eighth of a dollar per week until
the end of the fourth week when the rate was doubled. For a Duodecimo
one sixteenth of a dollar per week until the end of the second week._

_Constant attendance at the Library from Sunrise till 8 o’clock in the
evening._

In mentioning a few examples of the plates recently made for societies
and libraries, no attempt is made to furnish a complete list, nor even
to mention all the attractive plates, but to speak of a few which seem
of especial interest.

[Illustration: HARVARD UNIVERSITY ARNOLD-ARBORETUM 1892]

A pleasing architectural plate is used in Columbia College Library to
mark the books of the _Avery Architectural Library_. This was designed
by Russell Sturgis, and is in the form of a memorial window or mortuary
mural tablet. The central panel bears the inscription, and the date
MDCCCXC is given below.

The plate of the _Arnold Arboretum_, designed by George Wharton Edwards,
is very attractive; the just-rising sun shines upon a white pine which
stands within an elliptical frame; the names of the Institution and of
the University appear upon ribbons which float from the pine. The plate
is dated 1892, and is signed, _G. W. E._

The same artist designed the first book-plate of the _Grolier Club_ of
New York City. In this, Atlas is seen supporting the arms of the club
within a circular frame which bears the name, and the date of the
founding of the club, 1884; rich foliations with a pounced background
surround this central design. The plate is signed _G. W. E._

The _Public Library_ of the old whaling town of _New London_ has a plate
which is wholly nautical in construction; the name is given on a wheel
which is held by a seaman, while the captain stands by in pea-jacket and
rough-weather helmet, giving orders; the sail, which rises behind them,
affords space for the number of the book; below the deck on which the
mariners stand, are seen harpoons and spears of various sizes and kinds;
two dolphins are disporting in the waves. This plate is signed by the
name of the artist in full. It is by Mr. Edwards.

The _Sutro Library_ of San Francisco uses a plate which gives a large
and interesting picture of the natural resources of the locality, and
the enterprises carried on in its vicinity; the motto, _Labor omnia
vincit_, appears on the ribbon which floats in the air.

[Illustration: NEW-YORK SOCIETY LIBRARY]

The _Watkinson Library_ of Hartford uses one of the very few portrait
plates in the country; just why this style of plate should not be common
is not easy to understand. They are used in Boston and Worcester, as
mentioned below, but these instances are all that occur in public
libraries. In this plate the portrait of David Watkinson, the founder of
the library, is enclosed within an oval frame which bears the name and
the date of incorporation, 1858. The plate is signed by the American
Bank Note Company, New York, and is an excellent piece of steel
engraving.

Almost all of the historical societies use plates in which the arms of
the state or city in which they are located, are used. The
_Pennsylvania_, _Connecticut_, and _Maine Historical Societies_ have
plates of this kind. In the last-named plate an inescutcheon bears four
important dates in the history of the state of Maine.

  1605, _First voyage along the Coast by Waymouth_.
  1649, _Election of Godfrey as Governor_.
  1678, _Usurpation of Maine by Massachusetts_.
  1820, _Separation from Massachusetts_.

The _Rowfant Club_ of Cleveland uses a small plate representing the
corner of a library; the open window admits the fading light of the sun,
which is sinking into the sea; the lattice swings idly, and the pile of
books on the table proclaim a busy day.

A very striking plate is used by the _University Club of Washington_. A
wall of rough-faced stone is pierced by a small quatrefoil window in
which

[Illustration: Phœnix Society]

a book is laid; the date 1891 is stamped upon the side of the book.
Below this, Ionic columns support the wall; between them, in a smooth
space, is carved the name and city of the club. The plate is signed _Hy.
Sandham_.

[Illustration: S. Hopkins]

In the _Boston Public Library_ a large number of different plates is
used for the volumes coming from different legacies or funds, and in
very many cases these plates give a portrait of the donor. Thus we find
these portraits on the plate used in the books from the Ticknor Fund,
the Phillips Fund, and the Franklin Club Fund. The books remaining from
the library of Thomas Prince are also marked with a plate which gives
his portrait and a picture of the old meeting-house, in which he
preached, and in which the books were stored at one time.

Portraits also appear upon the book-plates of the _American Antiquarian
Society_, which gives that of Ginery Twichell; and the _Massachusetts
Historical Society_, which has a plate giving a portrait of James
Savage.

The public libraries of to-day do not usually use elaborate plates in
their book-covers; simple labels, with perhaps a city or corporation
seal, are the common kind.

BOOK-PLATES OF SPECIAL INTEREST.


[Illustration: S]everal reasons can be given for the fact that
collectors regard some book-plates as of more value than others. With
book-plates, as in other lines of collecting, rarity is a desirable
feature, and is a prominent element in deciding values.

All of our early American plates can fairly be called scarce when
compared with the foreign examples of the same period, for they
outnumber ours, fifty to one; but many among ours are rarer than others.
The _John Franklin_, brother of Benjamin, signed by Turner, is an
exceeding rare plate; the _Thomas Dering_, signed by Hurd, is very rare.
The plates of _Stephen Cleveland_, _Samuel Chase_, _Francis Kinloch_,
_Edward Augustus Holyoke_, _John Vassal_, _Lewis De Blois_, _Lenthal_,
_Apthorp_, the _John Pintard_, by Anderson, and many others are not seen
in many collections. The plate of _George Washington_ is the most
valuable probably of our plates; and while we know the location of a
good many of his books that have the plate within the covers, they are
in no way obtainable: this plate is not very common, but more copies of
it are owned than of some others.

[Illustration: Stephen Cleveland]

The libraries of our early days, while of respectable size, were not so
large as to require the printing of thousands of book-plates; fire and
mob violence have destroyed many books of those old collections and
their plates with them. Harvard, Yale, William and Mary, and Princeton

[Illustration: Columbia College Library]

have all suffered the loss of books by fire, while many smaller private
libraries have been thus devastated. Mr. John Pintard used to say that
he had seen the British soldiers carrying away books from the library of
Columbia College to barter for grog, and a similar fate from similar
hands overtook many of the books stored in the belfry-chamber of the Old
South Church, Boston, while later in our history, worse depredations
were committed in the Southern cities by soldiers, who took the liberty
which war accords to contestants, to despoil many a building, both
public and private, ruining books, records, paintings, and other
property of antiquarian and historical value. So that the early American
plates, at the first not so very numerous, have been reduced at times by
wholesale measures.

A second item of interest to the collector is the signature of the
engraver of the plate. Signed plates have a value over those which are
not signed. The identification of a plate, or the determination of its
age, may be considerably strengthened if the engraver’s name appears
upon the copper. Then, too, the name of a famous engraver lends much
additional interest to a plate. A book-plate signed by Paul Revere
arrests the attention of any observer at once, and establishes a value
to the same. Likewise a plate signed by Hurd, Doolittle, Dawkins,
Anderson, Maverick, Callender, or Turner is worth much more to the
collector than one of equal age but of unknown workmanship.

Dated plates also rank among the more valuable examples. A glance at the
chronological list will show how small a number of these we can boast:
many of those appearing in the list, too, are simply printed
name-labels, which do not rank as high as the more pretentious
specimens. Our very earliest dated example is the label of the _Rev.
John Williams_, 1679, the first minister in Deerfield, Mass., and who
with his wife and children was carried into captivity by the Indians in
1704. Coming next are the plates of _Francis Page_, 1703, and _William
Penn_, 1703, but they are both of English make. The plate of _Thomas_

[Illustration: Isaiah Thomas]

_Prince_, who was for forty years the pastor of the Old South Society in
Boston, is a simple label dated 1704. The plate of _Thomas Dering_,
signed by Hurd, and dated 1749, is the first American plate by an
American engraver that is both signed and dated. The _John Burnet_, by
Dawkins, dated 1754, is next in order; then comes the _Greene_ plate, by
Hurd, 1757, the _Albany Society Library_, 1759, concerning which very
little is known, and every few years an example until we come to the
opening of the century.

[Illustration: Albany Society Library]

Naturally the artistic quality of a book-plate influences its value; the
more elaborate designs are preferred to the plain armorials or the
printed labels. Pictorial plates, introducing bits of landscape,
interiors of libraries, or allegorical subjects, are sought for, as are
plates which are accepted as particularly good types of the different
styles. In addition to these technical reasons for valuing one plate
more highly than another may be given others which will appear more
reasonable perhaps to the general reader. All articles belonging to the
noted men of the past have a certain antiquarian value greater than
attaches to the kindred belongings of their contemporaries of lesser or
no fame. So with book-plates.

A glance at the list will show a goodly number of names which we
remember with pride and interest; the names of patriots, orators,
lawyers, statesmen, officers of the army, officers of the state and
nation, members of Congress, signers of the Declaration, governors,
old-time merchants, authors, divines, physicians, and not a few of that
plucky number who stood by the King in trying times--the American
Loyalists. Quakers, too, as well as royal office-holders, and titled
Americans are among those whose book-plates have come down to us.

Of our early Presidents, the plates of George Washington, John Adams,
John Quincy Adams, and John Tyler are known to us. All of these except
the last, which is a plain printed label, are armorial.

Members of the Boston Tea Party, of the Constitutional Convention, and
of the early Assemblies are among those whose plates we know.

[Illustration: John Quincy Adams.]

Of royal officers we have: Craven, one of the Lords Proprietors of South
Carolina; Elliston, Collector of His Majesty’s Customs at New York; Sir
William Keith, Governor of Pennsylvania; John Tabor Kempe,
Attorney-General under the Crown at New York; and William Penn,
Proprietor and Governor of the colony which bore his name.

Owners of large estates, employers of numbers of slaves, merchants whose
vessels carried on a trade with remote and prosperous shores, and who
established names that have endured, used book-plates which are still
known to us. Among these are the plates from the following families,
well-known in New England: Ames, Bowdoin, Cabot, Chandler, Chauncey,
Coffin, Lodge, Lowell, Minot, Quincy, Sears, Winthrop, Barrell, Greene,
Perkins, Swan, Vassall, and Vaughan.

[Illustration: Josiah Quincy]

Of those well-known in and about New York may be mentioned, Clinton,
Colden, Constable, Cutting, De Peyster, Duer, Ellery, Goelet, Hoffman,
Ogden, Paulding, Phillipse, Pintard, Van Cortlandt, and Van Rensselaer.
To these should be added the Livingstons, which family had the largest
number of book-plates of any we know.

In Philadelphia were the Logans, Morgans, Powels, Banckers, and
Hamiltons; while further South, the Lees, Lightfoots, Tayloes,
Wormeleys, Pages, Cabels, Tubervilles, Armisteads, Byrds, Blands,
Bollings, Dinwiddies, Fitzhughs, Hubards, Magills, and Randolphs used
plates and were families of prominence and distinction.

[Illustration: Livius.]

Among the prominent Loyalists are Chalmers, Cooper, Hallowell, Hamilton,
Livius, Lloyd, Oliver, and Robinson. Of titled Americans the following
used book-plates: Fairfax, Gardiner, Murray of Dunmore, and the
Pepperrell families.

Of the early authors we can mention Alsop, Antill, Bozman, Byrd, Dana,
Key, Stith, and Abercrombie; of physicians, Assheton, Bond, Beatty,
Holyoke, Middleton, and Jeffries; of the statesmen, Bayard, Carmichael,
Dana, Duane, Gallatin, Jay, Lewis, Marshall, Norris, and Randolph.

[Illustration: D^{r}. John Jeffries]

Among the early clergymen can be named Apthorp, Boucher, Williams,
Jarvis, and Provoost.

Allen and Thomas, early printers; Aitkin, who made the first American
edition of the Holy Bible; and Bartram, the great botanist, used plates,
which are described in the list.

Bloomfield, Brearly, Banister, Chester, Eustace, Hale, Mercer, Schuyler,
Sullivan, and Varick are among the soldiers of the Revolutionary army;
and of the orators we have Otis and Randolph.

Coming now to the signers of the Declaration, we find that we know thus
far the plates of eleven of them: John Adams, Charles Carroll, Samuel
Chase, Thomas Hayward, William Hooper, Francis Hopkinson, Benjamin Rush,
Richard Stockton, George Taylor, Oliver Wolcott, and George Wythe.

Surely the book-plates of all these men whose mention stirs patriotic
feeling, are of exceeding interest, and worthy to rank with any in point
of value and appreciation.

No book-plate, however, is of greater interest to the American collector
than that of _George Washington_, not alone by reason of the prominence
of that eminent man, but because of the scarcity of the plate, the high
price it brings, and the interesting fact that it is the only American
plate which has been deemed worthy of counterfeiting.

A genuine contemporary print of this plate is readily recognized by the
connoisseur. The plate has no striking features, but is a regular design
in the pure Chippendale style. The arms are displayed upon a shield of
the usual shell-like form, and the sprays and rose branches of this
style are used in the ornamentation of the sides of the escutcheon. The
motto, _Exitus acta probat_, is given upon its ribbon at the base of the
shield, and the name is engraved in script on

[Illustration: Edward Hale Bierstadt]

the bracket at the bottom of the design. In general appearance the plate
is like scores of Chippendale plates of the period.

[Illustration: George Washington]

The interesting question of the probable engraver of the plate has
arisen, and in a most readable article from the pen of Mr. R. C.
Lichtenstein, in the “Curio,” on the Library of Washington, the
following opinion is advanced: “It was his [Washington’s] habit as a
general rule to write his name on the right-hand corner of the
title-page and place inside his book-plate. It has been a matter of
uncertainty as to whether that book-plate was engraved in England or in
this country. Washington, like other Virginia gentlemen before the
Revolution, was in the habit of ordering goods every year from London;
but we have searched the various orders to his agents in London, and
examined as far as practicable the items of his household expenses,
without finding any such item. The strongest argument that can be said
in its favor proving it to be American work is the poor heraldry
displayed in its coat-of-arms, general make-up, and drawing. It will be
noticed that the engraver has placed a wreath under the crown (an
absolute heresy), and this, with the faulty drawing of the raven, makes
the whole plate a very slovenly piece of work. No engraver with any
knowledge of the fundamental laws of heraldry would be guilty of drawing
such a coat-of-arms as this. The arms of Washington engraved on his seal
and ring, undoubtedly cut in England, are correctly done. It seems more
than probable, if the plate had been done in England that the engraver
would not have been guilty of making such blunders. We have seen a great
many English plates, but have never noticed one bearing these
peculiarities. From its general appearance we should say that the plate
was made in America somewhere between the years 1777 and 1781.”

Collectors are divided in their opinions upon this question, and
although not ready to hazard a guess at the engraver, the present writer
believes the plate was engraved in England, and would place the date
nearly a decade earlier. As the friend of the Fairfax family,
Washington might have had the plate made upon the occasion of their
ordering work of the same kind from England, or, indeed, it might have
been a gift to him from them, or from some admiring friend. As he was a
methodical man, the fact that no entry of an expense for such an article
is found in his records may lend color to the presentation theory. As to
the errors in heraldry, there is a plate of one Richard Washington,
which has all the peculiarities of this plate, and this is signed by
Bickham, who was an English engraver of some note. He was a trifle early
perhaps to have been the engraver of the _George Washington_ plate, but
he may have made the plate which served as a copy for it. But whether
the plate was of domestic or foreign make, we know that the copper was
in this country, and that impressions were made from it not so very many
years ago. The late Mr. Mauran of Newport knew the man who owned this,
and it seems that having printed what he deemed a sufficient number of
re-strikes from it, this man, fearing lest others would in time get it
and make more prints, cut the copper into pieces and going out on a
bridge over the Schuylkill River, threw them in! There they may be
looked for by any who choose.

The counterfeit of this plate appeared in an auction sale of books, in
the city of Washington, about the year 1863. The late Dr. W. F. Poole
with Dr. J. M. Toner was present at the sale. The plate was placed in
these books for the purpose of getting a higher price for them than
could

[Illustration: George Washington]

otherwise have been obtained. These gentlemen detected the fraudulent
plate, and denounced it as such in the auction-room, and the books
brought only their actual value as books. Copies of this plate turn up
now and then, and the unsuspecting are still deceived by it. It is
readily detected if one is forewarned. The work is manifestly inferior
to the good plate, the alignment of the name is poor, the quality and
appearance of the paper belie its professed age, and the printing is of
decidedly different appearance, being bold and strong in the genuine,
and weak and thin in the forgery. A further difference is noted in the
crest, which is tinctured _gules_ in the forgery and _sable_ in the
genuine. These plates are sometimes claimed to be genuine and to be an
early and unsatisfactory piece of work, which Washington rejected, and
which was replaced with the other and accepted plate. This idea is
plausible perhaps to some, but to any who had information from Dr. Poole
it is an impossible theory. Another source of confusion is in the
reproductions of the plate which have been made from time to time to
illustrate works on the life of Washington, some of these being quite
faithful duplicates of the genuine plate with its trifling flaws; but
the paper and the printing are usually conclusive proof of the age of
the print. It is safe to say that there is but one genuine Washington
plate. It is true that the re-strikes of the original copper are about,
but these, too, are readily distinguishable by the printing and paper.

The plate of _Bushrod Washington_, nephew of George, is also of much
interest, and the manifest similarity of its design to some of the
plates by Dawkins has led to the suggestion that he made this plate. But
to the mind of the writer, Dawkins was not a man of originality, and was
a regular copyist when it came to book-plates; the similarity of the
plate of _James Samuels_ to this plate is rather to his mind a further
evidence of the clever adoption of a reasonably good design by Dawkins,
than of his having been chosen by Judge Washington to engrave his
book-plate. The design of this plate is more spirited than any of the
authenticated work of Dawkins; indeed, it surpasses the plate of the
General in that respect.

[Illustration: Bushrod Washington.]

The arms are the same in these two Washington plates. In his “Barons of
the Potomac and the Rappahannock” (published by the Grolier Club, 1892),
Mr. Moncure Daniel Conway has referred to the older form of the arms as
used by earlier members of the family. The earliest shields held “_Gules
on a barre argent 3 Cinquefoiles of ye first._” The second step was made
by changing to the following, “_Gules on a fesse sable 3 mullets._” The
last and present form is, “_Argent, two bars gules: in chief three
mullets of the second._” These last, it is claimed, suggested our
national flag.

The plate of _Elizabeth Graeme_ of Philadelphia should be noted here, as
it is the only example of an heraldic plate used by a lady of colonial
times. It is fully described in the list.

Leaving now these older plates of special interest to be discovered in
the Lists, we turn to a few modern plates which are worthy of particular
attention.

[Illustration: Dan Webster]

The plate of _Daniel Webster_ is a plain armorial with the motto, _Vera
pro gratis_, on the ribbon below the shield.

The etched plate of the late _James Eddy Mauran_, the early collector of
American and other book-plates, was an armorial of very handsome
appearance. The shield is surrounded with the style of decoration used
on the Chippendale examples, oak leaves being used in lieu of mantling.

An earlier plate in two sizes shows some differences in the design.

The plate of the late _George W. Childs_ seems wholly in keeping with
the career of its distinguished owner. The sword, broken into pieces by
the quill, is depicted within an oval garter which bears the motto,
_Nihil sine labore_. The words from Lytton’s Richelieu, _The pen is
mightier than the sword_, are also given just within the frame.

Coming now to mention a few plates of our well-known men of letters, we
naturally accept the plate of _Oliver Wendell Holmes_ as worthy of the
chiefest place. In this the motto, _Per ampliora ad altiora_, is given
on a ribbon beneath a beautiful representation of the “Chambered
Nautilus,” the

      Ship of pearl, which, poets feign,
      Sails the unshadowed main,--
      The venturous bark that flings
    On the sweet summer wind its purple wings
    In gulfs enchanted, where the Siren sings,
      And coral reefs lie bare,
      Where the cold sea-maids rise to sun their streaming hair.

“If you will look into Roget’s ‘Bridgewater Treatise,’” said the
Autocrat one morning, “you

[Illustration: Oliver Wendell Holmes.]

will find a figure of one of these shells and a section of it. The last
will show you the series of enlarging compartments successively dwelt in
by the animal that inhabits the shell, which is built in a widening
spiral. Can you find no lesson in this?

    “‘Build thee more stately mansions, O my soul,
       As the swift seasons roll!
       Leave thy low-vaulted past!
     Let each new temple nobler than the last,
     Shut thee from heaven with a dome more vast,
       Till thou at length art free,
       Leaving thine outgrown shell by life’s unresting sea.’”

[Illustration: JBM]

A plain armorial plate with the motto, _Vitam impendere vero_, and the
name in fac-simile of his autograph, was used by _J. G. Holland_.

The plate of _Brander Matthews_, designed by Edwin A. Abbey, represents
the discovery of a mask of the old Greek comedy by an American Indian.
With feathers stuck in his scanty hair, and his tomahawk laid on the
ground beside him, he appears to deliberate upon the possible use of the
enormous face which grins at him from his knee. On a circular frame
surrounding this picture the following words from Molière are given,
_Que pensez vous de cette comedie_. The appropriateness of the design is
apparent for one who is a collector of the literature of the French
drama, and the author of several books relating to the stage both in
America and France.

[Illustration: STEDMAN]

In the plate of _Edmund Clarence Stedman_, the author of “The Poets of
America,” we see Pan piping in the sylvan glades; the shepherd and the
nymph are charmed by the music, and the god is apparently at the height
of his effort. The frame surrounding the design bears the words, _Le
Cœur au Metier_, which were suggested by the address of Matthew Arnold
to the Authors’ Club in 1883. This plate is made in three sizes.

The plate of _Thomas Bailey Aldrich_ presents within a square frame a
picture of a black bird resting upon a comic mask; the heavy panelled
frame bears the owner’s name and the words, _His Mark_. In his essay on
American Book-plates, Mr. Laurence Hutton questions whether this black
bird is representative of the Daw, and symbolic of Margery of that name.

In the plate of _Eugene Field_ we have a beautiful example of the plain
armorial, unaccompanied by motto or ornamentation of any kind.

Of similar character is the plate of _Richard Grant White_. This is
armorial, but the motto, _The right and sleep_, is given, and the shield
is decorated in a conventional manner, with mantling and scrolls.

A pleasing library interior is used by _Arlo Bates_. This represents an
Oriental interior; a youth in scull-cap and flowing hair is reading a
large book; a lily stem rises from a vase of striped Tyrian glass at his
side; rows of books are seen at his back; and out of the arched window
the distant fields are seen, with the palm and cypress trees on the
hillside. This plate is produced in a new manner, being a gelatine print
or half-tone direct from the pencil sketch. It preserves a very soft and
pleasant effect; indeed, one feels sure it will smirch if rubbed.

_Laurence Hutton_ in his plate places a full-length statue of Thackeray
within a canopy, which seems to be a niche within a book-case. Volumes
flank both sides, and the amiable face of the drastic writer looks
directly at the beholder. The name of the owner is given on a ribbon at
the bottom of the design.

[Illustration: LAURENCE HUTTON]

The books of the lamented actors, _Edwin Booth_ and _Lawrence Barrett_,
were marked with book-plates, the former using a plain armorial with no
name engraved upon it, and the latter showing the mask of Tragedy upon
an open volume, with the motto, _Esto quod esse videris_.

The reading monk, with the nimbus and star over his head, is seen in the
plate of _Edward Eggleston_. The sentiment, _Flie fro’ the presse and
dwell with sothfastnesse_, is given in old English letters.

_Mr. Rossiter Johnson_ uses a very plain but effective label bearing the
initials _R. J._ printed within a plain ruled border: all in red ink.

The patriotic motto of _General Winfield Scott_ is the family motto of
the Scots of Whitislaid, Scotland, and well did the character of the man
who used the book-plate depicted below coincide with its meaning.

It would be interesting to extend this list of plates used by men well
known throughout the length and breadth of our land, but, unfortunately,
many whose names will occur to the reader do not use a book-plate.

EARLY AMERICAN BOOK-PLATE ENGRAVERS.


[Illustration: N]athaniel Hurd, who was born in Boston, Feb. 13, 1730,
and who died in 1777, was the best of our early engravers of
book-plates. Very little is now known of him, the principal source of
information being an article in the third volume of “The New England
Magazine,” published in Boston in 1832 by J. T. and E. Buckingham. The
only known portrait of Hurd, which is copied from an original painting
of him by Copley, and which in 1832 was owned by a descendant of Hurd in
Medford, Mass., also accompanies this article, and shows him as a young
man with smooth face, very pleasing and intelligent features, and
wearing a cap, white neck-cloth, and clothes of a pattern which give him
a decidedly clerical appearance.

The only book-plate work mentioned in this article is the large plate
for Harvard College. It is said that the prints done in red ink were for
use in the highly valuable books which the students were not allowed to
take from the library. Several brilliant caricatures, a portrait of the
Rev.

[Illustration: W. F. HOPSON]

Dr. Sewell of the Old South Church, done in 1764, and a few other
examples of his art are mentioned. He is (probably inaccurately) claimed
to be the first person who undertook to engrave on copper in the United
States. He was a man of natural talent and real genius, was
self-instructed in his art, and was regarded as the foremost seal-cutter
and die-engraver of his time, in this country.

The following advertisement from the Boston “Gazette” of April 28, 1760,
is of some interest:--

     “Nathaniel Hurd Informs his Customers he has remov’d his shop from
     Maccarty’s Corner on the Exchange to the Back Part of the opposite
     Brick Building, where Mr. Ezekiel Price kept his Office, where he
     continues to do all Sorts of Goldsmiths Work. Likewise engraves in
     Gold, Silver, Copper, Brass, and Steel, in the neatest Manner, and
     at reasonable Rate.”

Hurd worked principally in the Chippendale style; he made some plates in
the Jacobean and a few in the Ribbon and Wreath styles, but he died
before the latter was much in use, and the former was really going out
when he took up the making of plates. Judging from the appearance of his
work, his first attempts were in the Chippendale style, and the few
Jacobeans he made were done after he had attained considerable
efficiency.

One of his earliest specimens was undoubtedly the plate of _Edward
Augustus Holyoke_, the famous doctor of Boston, who lived to be one
hundred years old, and who was but a year or two the senior of Hurd. In
this plate he used a design which he evidently believed he could improve
upon, and in which he felt there were good features, for we find a
number of future plates of very similar design but much better
execution. In the Holyoke plate the work is very crude, the lines are
stiff, the drawing is poor, and the lettering of the motto and name are
not good. An ugly scroll is placed under the name, and the festoon of
cloth which is draped at the bottom of the frame and around the motto
ribbon is especially poor; the shell at the base of the escutcheon which
figures so often in future plates is here used, and the queer little
flow of water from it would not be recognized as such were this the only
specimen in which it occurs; the arrangement of the rose sprays, the
form of the shield, and the employment of the shelly edge show a
thorough study of the elements of this style. Very likely this design
was copied in great part from some foreign example which had come into
his possession.

In the _Thomas Dering_ plate, which is the earliest plate dated and
signed by an American engraver, this same design is improved upon; it is
more compact in appearance, a little freer in execution, and the drawing
is improved. The name is still not very well engraved, and top-heavy
flourishes weigh down the capitals.

In the _Theodore Atkinson_ plate the same design is still further
improved upon; the flow of water from the scallop shell is here caught
in a little bowl, a little additional flowery ornamentation is added,
and the heraldic drawing is better. The name is again embellished with
graceless flourishes.

The design seems to reach perfection in the _Wentworth_ plate; every
feature is markedly better, the water still flows out of the scallop
shell, the same shaped shield is used and the motto is placed upon a
graceful ribbon with ends which run off into fancy foliations. The name
is neat in appearance, but still there are too many scrolls.

[Illustration: Robert Hale Esq^{r}. OF BEVERLY]

In the plate of _Robert Hale of Beverly_, the old festoon of cloth
noticed in the Holyoke plate is seen again, and no motto is given. The
name is fairly well engraved.

Later developments of this style are seen in the plates of _Henry
Marchant_, _Danforth_, _Nathaniel Tracy_, and _John Marston_; in these
some of the features of the former are wanting, but they are evidently a
legitimate progeny in the matter of style.

[Illustration: John Chandler Jun^{r}. Esq^{r}.]

Another, and without doubt the highest type of the Chippendale plate
which Hurd made, is seen in the _John Chandler, Jr._, the _Dana_, the
_Philip Dumeresque_, the _Vassall_, and the _Wilson_ plates. In these
the shield becomes larger, the whole scheme of decoration shows more
fine detail work, and the effect is lighter, more graceful, and seems at
once the work of a master. The names are engraved in large bold type,
with a characteristic dash after the last period.

[Illustration: Lew.^{s.} De Blois]

In the Jacobean style, the earliest of Hurd’s work is undoubtedly the
_Lewis De Blois_. This is crude in workmanship, not very good in
drawing, but excellent in design, and faithful to the characteristics
of the style; the shield is placed against a frame which is lined with
the regulation fish-scale pattern; the sides are richly foliated, the
mantling is profuse and very well drawn, and the name is placed upon a
fringed curtain which is tied up at the ends with ribbon.

[Illustration: Joshua Spooner.]

The handsomest Jacobean plates by Hurd are the _Robert Jenkins_, the
_Spooner_, and the _Andrew_ Tyler. In the former the lining is
diapered, the scroll work at the side of the arms is very fine, and at
the bottom, under the shield, a small vignette of a ship under full sail
is very pretty. At the top of the scrolls on either side two turbanded
female heads peer at each other across the crest.

In the _Tyler_ plate the frame is very similar to the Jenkins, the
lining is diapered, and the scroll at the side are the same. The little
vignette at the bottom, however, is displaced by a sour face with gray
hair. The two faces are replaced by urns filled with flowers, and the
old cloth festoon is draped below the whole design. The _Spooner_ plate
bears no resemblance to the others, and is a more graceful design. The
lining is latticed, the Sphinx head under the shield is enclosed within
a frame of its own, and at either side are term figures from whose hands
depend bouquets of flowers; the crest is overarched with a bit of the
old scallop shell, and the motto is on a ribbon, which, wholly
unsupported, maintains a curved position under the frame.

The Jacobean plates of _Benjamin Greene_ and _Peter R. Livingston_ are
almost identical in design; the small frame which encloses the shield is
lined with the fish-scale pattern, the mantling is handsome and profuse,
and the motto ribbon is stretched in rather stiff manner below the
frame.

Only two examples of the Ribbon and Wreath style are known as Hurd’s
work, the _John C. Williams_ and the _Jonathan Jackson_. These are both
signed, and are very similar in design. Garlands of roses depending
from rings above follow closely the outline of the heart-shaped shield,
and the ribbon for the motto is placed beneath, and is ornamented with
fancy ends.

In the “detur” plate for _Harvard College_ Hurd conformed to the English
manner and adopted the seal-shaped design. The arms are displayed upon a
heart-shaped shield which is enclosed within a circle which bears the
name and motto, and this again is enclosed by a wreath of holly
branches.

[Illustration: Harvard College]

Hurd’s work is the most interesting found in our early days, and a study
of it shows him to have been progressive as well as painstaking. The
Ribbon and Wreath style did not come into general use in England until
about 1770, yet Hurd, who died in 1777, had used it. The colonies could
not be expected to adopt the new styles of the old country immediately,
and the condition of things from 1770 on to the time of Hurd’s death was
not such as to encourage the introduction of “fads” or to allow much
time for the development of the fine arts.

A word must be said about the heraldry on Hurd’s book-plates. This
science, heraldry, was not held in such general esteem among the New
Englanders as it was further south, and while many of the governors and
men of high standing in the Northern colonies brought armorial seals
with them, a great many who used them did so without strict heraldic
authority, and when it became the fashion to use coats-of-arms in
various ways, the herald painters of those days, who had but slight
knowledge of heraldry and who were possessed of a copy of Guillim or
some other writer on the subject, would find therein the arms of some
family bearing the name of their prospective customer, and without
further research would proceed to produce the coat as described. Not
always were these arms so ordered correctly borne; indeed, there is much
uncertainty about the arms used after about 1730 when our native
engravers and painters took up the work of producing arms upon orders.
Such seals as were brought by the colonists from England, and such as
were used by their descendants are undoubtedly correct, but the
questionable arms are those which, as mentioned above, were looked up in
this country only, by means of such heraldic works as were at hand. The
presence of the arms then on some book-plates cannot be relied upon as
sufficient and indisputable proof of their owners’ right to them.

Of JAMES AKIN, who signs the _Coffin_ and _Browne_ plates, nothing is
learned. The _Hector Coffin_ book-plate is also signed by Francis
Kearney, which would seem to indicate that Akin was associated with him.
The _Browne_ is a Philadelphia plate, and Akin may have been employed by
the firm of Tanner, Vallance, Kearney and Company, which was in
successful operation in Philadelphia for some years.

S. ALLARDICE was apprenticed to Robert Scott, who had been a pupil of
Robert Strange, and who, coming to America, was made die-sinker to the
Mint. He had previously made the architectural plates for Dobson’s
Encyclopædia.

Only one example of the book-plate work of Allardice is now at hand, and
that is simply an engraved label for the _Library Company of Baltimore_.
Ornamented with flourishes, and some fancy work, it is yet of no merit
as a book-plate or an example of art.

ALEXANDER ANDERSON, who was the first American wood-engraver, was born
in the city of New York, April 21, 1775, and lived to the advanced age
of ninety-five years, dying, in 1870, in Jersey City, N.J., on the 17th
of February.

At the age of twelve, with the spring of a pocket-knife, sharpened for
the purpose, he tried

[Illustration: Peter A. Browne]

to engrave on copper pennies rolled thin. In this way he made his first
plate, which was a head of Paul Jones; and his first impression from it
was made in red oil paint by a rude kind of a press of his own
contrivance. With tools made by a blacksmith, he went on to cut little
ships and houses on type metal for the newspapers. Being in some way led
to take an interest in certain medical works, he copied many of the
plates, and his father, feeling that this was a true sign of his fitness
for the profession of medicine, and not discerning the talent for
engraving, placed him with Dr. Joseph Young, as a student of medicine.

This step was taken with great reluctance by the youth; but he found
time for both the cares of his new study, and for the pleasures of his
old pastime. Various successes encouraged him, and in 1793 he cut a
tobacco-stamp on wood, which appears to have been his first use of that
material. Soon after this, he obtained a copy of Bewick’s “Quadrupeds,”
and with the cuts found therein he was delighted. They had a strong
influence upon his later work, and he has been well called the “American
Bewick,” for his small wood-cuts closely resemble those of the English
master in design, and his prominence in this country was equal to
Bewick’s in England.

A life of Dr. Anderson has lately (1893) been issued in New York; but,
to the disappointment of book-plate collectors, not a word is said of
his making book-plates.

Of the seven plates by Anderson known at present, four are on wood, and
three are on copper.

[Illustration: JOHN PINTARD, LL. D.]

Only one of those on wood is signed. The _Lot Tripp_ and _Josh. Russell_
plates are simple labels, and the _Typographical Society of New York_
and the _John Pintard, LL.D._, which is signed, are pictorial. In the
former, the emblems and implements of the printing trade are prominent,
and in the _Pintard_, which is a fine example

[Illustration: Alex^{r} Anderson.]

of Anderson’s best work on wood, the shield of arms is shown with a
landscape for background.

[Illustration: APPRENTICES’ LIBRARY.]

The plates on copper are the _Anderson_, which is a Chippendale, the
_Apprentices’ Library_, and the _Columbia College_, which are
allegorical.

All the above will be found described in the List.

There is a plate of the _Apprentices’ Library Company of Philadelphia_
which strongly resembles the wood-cut work of Anderson, but as it is not
signed it is not safely attributed to him. In the plate of _A. Griggs_
of Philadelphia, an even more marked resemblance to his little designs
on wood is seen, but this, too, is not signed.

ANNIN AND SMITH. This firm consisted of _W. B. Annin_ and _George C.
Smith_, and they were established in Boston from 1820 to 1837. Annin
died in 1839, in Boston, and Smith, who lived to quite an advanced age,
died in 1878. They engraved a number of plates for the “Token,” and for
other annuals so popular sixty years ago.

The plates of _Richard Taylor Auchmuty_, _A. L. Peirson_, _William H.
Prescott_, _John Lowell, Jr._, and an armorial plate for the _Boylston
Medical Library_ are signed by them, and will be found described in the
List.

ABEL BOWEN, whose name appears on one of the plates of _Harvard
College_, was the first wood-engraver in Boston. He was born in New York
state in 1790, and he took up engraving before he was of age. In 1812 he
was a printer in Boston, probably attracted thither by his uncle, who
was the proprietor of the Columbian

[Illustration: WILLIAM ASHMEAD COURTENAY]

Museum. Nathaniel Dearborn claims to be the first engraver on wood in
Boston, but the honor is usually accorded to Bowen. He issued, in 1816,
the “Naval Monument,” and in 1817 was associated with Dearborn in
engraving for Shaw’s “History of Boston.” In 1834 Bowen, with others,
founded “The Boston Bewick Company,” which was an association of
engravers. In the following year they issued a map of Boston, and
undertook the publishing of the “American Magazine.” They were burned
out in this same year. Bowen died in 1850.

JOHN BOYD, who engraved the plate of _Samuel Chase_, which is taken to
be the plate of the signer of the Declaration, was a Philadelphia
engraver. This is the only specimen of his work on book-plates which we
have, and it is a very pretty Chippendale design, delicately engraved.

In Dunlap, a J. Boyd is simply mentioned, who was engraving in
Philadelphia in 1812. This, if the engraver of the Chase plate, would
make him rather young at the time of doing it, and it is very good work,
and not the experiment of a novice. Whether this is the same engraver, I
do not know.

JOSEPH CALLENDER was born in Boston, May 6, 1751. Very little is known
about him, but he is reported to have acquired the plates of Peter
Pelham, who was presumably the first to engrave on copper in America,
and to have destroyed them. Callender made most of the dies for the
second Massachusetts Mint, at a cost of £1 4_s._ each. This was
considered an exorbitant price by the superintendent, who made a
contract with a Newburyport artisan, Jacob Perkins. Callender received
£48 12_s._ for making thirty-nine dies, and repairing three others,
while Perkins received but £3 18_s._ 10_d._ for his work. Callender died
in Boston, Nov. 10, 1821, and was buried in the Granary Burying Ground.

The only Chippendale plate by Callender is a copy of the _Atkinson_
plate by Hurd, and is for a member of the same family. As compared with
its model, this plate shows very little difference, it is so close a
copy, but the motto ribbon which is added is more graceful than those of
Hurd usually were, the heraldic drawing is quite as good, and the
lettering of the name is better. Callender, of course, would not have
begun to engrave much before Hurd’s death; indeed, the preponderance of
the Ribbon and Wreath style in his designs goes to show that his work
dated towards the close of the century.

His plates in this style are very light and graceful, with no
overloading; and a faithful use of the usual features of the style is
apparent.

In the _Russell_ plate he was again a copyist, using for his model the
_Joseph Barrell_ plate. The plates for the _American Academy of Arts and
Sciences_, and for the _Massachusetts Medical Society_ are practically
alike; the curtain, and the

[Illustration: Thomas Russell]

ribbon and festooning are very similar, while the view within the oval
frame is, of course, adapted to the use of the books of the respective
societies. Callender would seem by these signs to have been a lazy
engraver, or to have considered his designs so perfect as to call for no
further effort.

CEPHAS G. CHILDS, who engraved the plate of _Henry D. Gilpin_, was born
in Pennsylvania, in 1793. In the years 1827 to 1830, he published a set
of views of the city of Philadelphia and its vicinity (Baker).

[Illustration: Henry D. Gilpin.]

HENRY DAWKINS was an engraver of but few original ideas, if we may judge
him rightly by his book-plate work. In this he was very largely a
copyist. Working altogether in the Chippendale style, his designs for
the most part are variations of one general plan, which seems to have
been borrowed from an English-made plate. In his plates we see
“Chippendalism run wild.” Here are introduced the love-sick swains who
play upon the flute; the dandy shepherds in stiff clothes of the most
fashionable cut, flowing curls, and large felt hats; the flirting young
damsels in very low-cut bodices, who play at being shepherdesses for the
sake of following the above-mentioned gentle keeper of sheep. Here are
the music-loving Cupids, the scantily clad females who are attended by
the Cupids, and who are far from home among the trees of the wood. In
the _James Duane_ plate we find a fountain is fixed to the side of the
frame, and is spouting water from the mouth of a man’s head.

But the plates of _Samuel Jones_, _Samuel Stringer_, and _Peter W.
Yates_ are proof that Dawkins could confine himself to the legitimate
features of good Chippendale plates. In these no outside objects are
introduced, and the design is good.

We do not know much about Dawkins. Dunlap says he was probably from
England, and that he was first noticed in New York. Originally he was an
ornamenter of buttons and other small bits of metal, but in America he
worked at anything that offered, “suiting himself to the poverty of the
arts at the time.” Dunlap dates him about 1774, evidently on the
strength of the word of Dr. Anderson, who remembered to have seen
“shop-bills and coats-of-arms for books,” done by him previous to 1775.
However, in 1761, he engraved music for a book of Psalm Tunes published
in that year in Philadelphia. His earliest dated book-plate is that of
_John Burnet_ (1754). He was skilful enough to make counterfeit
Continental currency, but not to avoid arrest; and in 1776 we find him
suffering for this misdeed. Some time later, he forwarded the following
unique petition to the Committee of Safety:--

     “MAY IT PLEASE YOUR HONOURS,--The subscriber humbly relying on the
     known goodness and humanity of this honourable house, begs leave to
     lay his complaint before them, which is briefly as follows. That
     your petitioner was about six months past taken upon Long Island
     for a trespass which this house is thoroughly acquainted as by
     Israel Youngs he was led away to perform an action of which he has
     sincerely repented and your petitioner was torn away from an only
     son who was left among strangers without any support, or protection
     during the inclemency of the approaching winter, as his unhappy
     father hath since the first day he was taken had but one shirt and
     one pair of stockings to shift himself, and hath been affected
     during his imprisonment at White Plains with that worst of enemies
     hunger, and a nauseous stench of a small room where some twenty
     persons were confined together which hath introduced a sickness on
     your distressed subscriber which with the fatigue of travelling
     hath reduced your unhappy petitioner to a state of despondency--he
     therefore being weary of such a miserable life as his misconduct
     has thrown him into begs for a termination by death to be inflicted
     upon him in what manner the honourable House may see fit. The kind
     compliance of this honourable House will ever lay an obligation on
     your distressed humble servent

HENRY DAWKINS.”



We do not know in what manner the honorable house received this
extraordinary petition; but, as book-plates are in existence in his
later style, probably it was not granted. Dawkins used three distinct
varieties of the Chippendale style. The plates of _Benjamin Kissam_, the
_Ludlow_ and _Roome_ plates, the _Whitehead Hicks_ and the _James Duane_
are examples of the debased

[Illustration: Whitehead Hicks Esq.]

Chippendale. He had also a style which is illustrated by the
_Hopkinson_, _Samuels_, and _Tomlinson_ plates, which is closely allied
to the style of the _Bushrod Washington_. The same hissing dragon, the
same tilt to the whole design, and the similarity in detail and
execution have led to the question of his being the engraver of the
latter plate. It is not a question easy to decide, and collectors are
divided over the question. This style of plate came originally from
England, we can be sure; and as Dawkins is seen to be a copyist, it is
quite as likely that he copied from the _Bushrod Washington_ plate, as
that he designed it. He always used a squarer copper than the Washington
plate is engraved upon; but this has evidences of having been cut down
after engraving. The present writer does not think the plate can be
safely attributed to Dawkins. The _Child_ and _Jones_ plates exemplify
the third style.

The debased Chippendale plates which Dawkins made were apparently copied
from an English example he had seen.

NATHANIEL DEARBORN was born in 1786, and was the son of Benjamin
Dearborn, a man of attainments in science. Nathaniel was one of the
first wood-engravers in Boston, and was associated with Abel Bowen for a
time.

The only armorial book-plate signed by Dearborn is the _Charles Beck_,
which is a peculiar design, following no particular style, but making a
pretty plate.

A second plate signed by Dearborn is the simple engraved verse for
_Isaac Child_.

AMOS DOOLITTLE, who was born in 1754, was one of the first engravers of
historical scenes in America. In Barber’s “History and Antiquities of
New Haven,” published in 1831, is an advertisement of “four different
views of the Battle of Lexington, Concord, etc. on the 19 April 1775.” A
list of the plates follows, and it is remarked that they were “neatly
engraved on copper from original paintings taken on the spot.” In a note
which follows, it is further remarked that the pictures were first drawn
by Mr. Earl, who was a portrait painter, and who with Mr. Doolittle was
a member of the Governor’s Guard which went to Cambridge and the scene
of action under the command of Arnold.

[Illustration: Social Library. Stepney Society Wethersfield]

As a maker of book-plates, Doolittle was fond of the allegorical style.
He made two plates for the _Societies of Yale College_, and one for the
village library of _Wethersfield_. The latter is an ornamental label
only, but the former are quite elaborate examples of the allegorical.
The plates of _Benjamin S. Brooks_, in the Ribbon and Wreath style, and
_Charles H. Wetmore_, which is a copy of one of Maverick’s favorite
designs, complete the number of his signed examples. The _Guilford
Library_ and _George Goodwin_ plates, which have some features in common
with the _Wethersfield Library_, are confidently attributed to him.

GIDEON FAIRMAN, whose signature is on one of the plates of _Henry
McMurtrie_ and one of the _Linonian Society of Yale College_, was born
in Connecticut in 1774. He showed an early fondness for engraving, and
made rude attempts which showed undoubted talent. In 1810, having made
himself a master of his art, he went into partnership with Murray,
Draper, and others, in Philadelphia. He made considerable money, and
went over to England with Jacob Perkins, where, with Charles Heath for a
third partner, they were successful but for a short time, the
extravagance of Murray proving their ruin.

JOHN MASON FURNASS was the nephew of Hurd, to whom the latter left his
engraving tools by will, as the young man showed so much ability in the
art practised by his widely known uncle.

He was also a painter of portraits, and he had a studio in Boston, which
was also used by Trumbull.

The only plate signed by this engraver, which the present writer has
seen, is the _Eli Forbes_. This plate shows but few traces of the
influence of Hurd. It is a Chippendale design, but

[Illustration: Eli Forbes.]

is not in either of the characteristic modes of Hurd. It is an ambitious
plate, and was meant to be very fine, evidently. It is full of
flourishes, and the little spiral flourish at the lower right-hand side
is wholly out of place; the robin picking rose leaves at the side is an
innovation. The scrolls under the name are somewhat in the manner of
Hurd. The heraldic drawing is poor, and the bunch of arrows between the
shield and the crest must be in allusion to the occupation of the owner,
who was a missionary to the Indians.

[Illustration: John Chambers Esq^{r}.]

There is said to be a plate by Furnass owned in Boston, by the name of
_Foster_, but no definite knowledge of it has been obtained.

E. GALLAUDET, who signed the plate for the _New York Society Library_
and the plate of _John Chambers_, was one Elisha Gallaudet, who
practised his art in New York City towards the end of the last century.

EDWARD GALLAUDET, a relative of the above, was superior to him as an
engraver, and the _Gallaudet_ plate mentioned in the List is by him. He
was of the present century.

ABRAHAM GODWIN was born in New Jersey in 1763. He was intended for the
profession of the law, and was placed in the office of his brother, at
Fishkill, in New York state. Both men joined the army, however; and when
Abraham returned to his home, it was to take up the art of engraving,
towards which he had had an inclination from boyhood, when he made his
first attempts on the silver plate of his friends, with a graver made by
a blacksmith.

The only example of his book-plate work is a plate fully described under
the heading, “Unidentified,” in the List. Most unfortunately, the only
example known has the family name torn out. The first name is _John_.
The plate is rather rudely engraved, but is quite ambitious, showing the
interior of a large room, which might be either a school-room or a
library.

S. HARRIS, who engraved the pictorial plates of _Henry Andrews_ and the
anonymous _Williams_, was a New England engraver, who was in Boston
about 1798.

CHARLES P. HARRISON, who signed the plain armorial book-plates of
_William Betts_ and _David Paul Brown_, was a son of William Harrison,
an English engraver, who came to New York in 1794, and was for a time an
instructor of Peter Maverick the second.

SAMUEL HILL was a copper-plate engraver in Boston, about 1790, and his
work consisted mostly of portraits and book work.

The following are examples of his work:--

    at the Boston Book Store  Ornamented label.
  Charles Pierpont            Ribbon and Wreath.

Also the plate of _Saml. Hill_, which is of a literary flavor, is
probably the engraver’s own plate.

bank-notes.

THOMAS JOHNSON was born in Boston in 1708. He was buried in King’s
Chapel Burying-ground, May 8, 1767. He engraved Psalm Tune plates

[Illustration: EDMUND H. GARRETT]

for the Tate and Brady edition of 1760, and did some commendable work as
a herald painter. In the inventory of his estate, fifteen copper plates
are appraised at 40_s._

Only one specimen of his book-plate work is authenticated, and that is
the _Joseph Tyler_, which is signed in full,--_Johnson_.

       *       *       *       *       *

THOMAS JOHNSTON signs the very beautiful Jacobean plate of _William P.
Smith, A.M._, and the rougher Chippendale of _Samuel Willis_. Whether
this is the same engraver as the above is uncertain; the difference in
the spelling of the name would not disprove the claim, as in those days
such differences were frequent. The _Willis_ plate bears strong
resemblance to the work and designs of Hurd. If this is the same
engraver as the above, these two plates are likely to be the earliest
signed plates by an American, as Johnson was born some twenty years
before Hurd. The _Willis_ plate is quite inferior to the _Smith_, which
latter is a striking example of the Jacobean style.

FRANCIS KEARNEY, who signs the plate of _Henry McMurtrie_ and _Hector
Coffin_, was born in 1780. He was a pupil of Peter R. Maverick, who
received two hundred and fifty dollars for instructing him for three
years. The advantage was all with Maverick. Soon after the opening of
the century, he was engaged with Anderson, the younger Maverick, Boyd,
and others, in engraving plates for a quarto Bible published by Mr.
Collins, of New York.

In 1810 he removed to Philadelphia, as that city was far ahead of New
York in the publishing of books, etc. He was in that city for over
twenty years. His greatest work is the engraving of Leonardo da Vinci’s
picture of the “Last Supper.”

PETER RUSHTON MAVERICK was born in England, April 11, 1755, and came to
America about 1774. He was originally a silversmith, and came of a
family whose members were for several generations well known as
engravers, and who made the art their occupation. He was an energetic
worker, getting most of his practical knowledge by his own endeavors. He
was the teacher of William Dunlap and of Francis Kearney, as well as of
his own son, who ultimately became a more proficient engraver than his
father, and, who after instructing A. B. Durand for five years, took him
into partnership.

Peter R. Maverick died in New York, about 1807, and his son Peter whose
partnership with Durand resulted disastrously, died in 1831.

As a designer and engraver of book-plates, Maverick was the most
prolific of all the early engravers. It is presumed that all the plates
signed either P. R. Maverick, or simply Maverick, were by the same hand,
as a large collection of

proofs from his plates which furnishes examples of both ways of signing
is now in the possession of the New York Historical Society, and the
librarian informs me that all of the plates in that collection were done
in 1789 by the elder Maverick. This collection consists of sixty-five
plates, of which thirty-eight different ones are signed by Maverick.
There are also others which are undoubtedly his work, although not
signed, and there are examples by Dawkins, Hutt, and Child. Quite a
number of the plates are duplicated, too. This very interesting
collection of proofs, kept by Maverick himself, and sewed together
roughly, was in the library of his friend, John Allan. By far the
greater part of Maverick’s plates are of the Ribbon and Wreath style,
but he made a few Jacobeans, a few Chippendales, and one or two
pictorial and allegorical designs. He used the same features over and
over in his plates, and seems to have been a rapid worker. The plates in
the following list marked * are by the younger Maverick.

OLIVER PELTON, who engraved a plate for the _Brothers in Unity_, at Yale
College, was born in Portland, Conn., in 1799, and learned his trade
with Abner Read, a bank-note engraver, of Hartford. He was an assiduous
worker, and was taken into partnership after two years’ work, with Mr.
Read and one Samuel Stiles. Samuel G. Goodrich (Peter Parley) soon
induced him to go to Boston with him, to engage in the engraving of
plates for his works. This enterprise was successful, and in 1863 Pelton
formed a partnership with William D. Terry, which was the foundation of
the New England Bank-Note Company of Boston. The plate mentioned is the
only example of his work on book-plates.

R. RAWDON, who signs the plate of _William L. Stone_, which is a very
handsome steel-plate design, was born in Tolland, Conn., and was
associated with his brother in Albany. The brother subsequently moved to
New York.

PAUL REVERE, the Revolutionary patriot whose “midnight ride” is known
the world over, was born in Boston, January 1, 1735, and died there on
the 10th of May, 1818, after a life of great usefulness, leaving a name
never to be forgotten.

He came of a Huguenot family, who spelled the name Rivoire originally.

[Illustration: William Wetmore]

He was self-instructed in the art of engraving on copper, although
brought up by his father to the business of a goldsmith. He went on the
Crown Point expedition, 1756, and after his return, married, and settled
down to the business he had already learned. He was naturally fond of
mechanics, and made himself master of its general principles. One of his
earliest attempts on copper was the portrait of his friend, Dr. Mayhew.
He also engraved several caricatures which were popular, and some
historical pictures which are valuable now to the collector.

[Illustration: Paul Revere]

Not many book-plates have come down to us by this celebrated patriot,
and the following list comprises all that are signed.

  Gardiner Chandler    Chippendale.
  David Greene         Chippendale.
  Epes Sargent         Chippendale.
  William Wetmore      Ribbon and Wreath.

Revere’s plates do not have the compact appearance of Hurd’s, and are
not so well designed or so well engraved as the latter’s. Presumably
this branch of work was not very profitable to him, or very much
cultivated.

The accompanying design was undoubtedly a book-plate, and beyond
question is the work of Revere. It is a very rare plate.

WILLIAM ROLLINSON was born in England, in the year 1760. He was in youth
brought up to the trade of ornamenting buttons; and, upon coming to New
York, made the gilt buttons which decorated the coat worn by Washington
at his inauguration as President. He did this without remuneration, so
thoroughly sympathizing with the country of his adoption as to feel the
honor of this service for Washington a full compensation. He was,
through the friendship of Messrs. Elias Hicks and John C. Ludlow,
recommended to the publishers of Brown’s Family Bible, for which he made
several plates. Previous to this, he found work in the shops of
different silversmiths, and had taught himself the art of engraving on
copper. At the beginning of the century, Archibald Robertson painted a
portrait of Alexander Hamilton, which Rollinson boldly undertook to make
a large engraving from. He did not understand all the processes of
engraving, and invented such as he was compelled to use, as he went on.
The duel in which Hamilton lost his life occurred before the portrait
was fully engraved. Indeed, it had been undertaken more as an experiment
than with the idea of sale; but the friends of the dead statesman urged
him to complete it, which he did, and the print found a good sale.
Later, Rollinson invented a machine for ruling waved lines, which was of
vast importance in the manufacture of bank-notes.

As an engraver of book-plates, he adopted the Ribbon and Wreath style
naturally, as it was the style in vogue when he took up the work. He
made one or two plain armorials, and for the _New York College of
Pharmacy_ one of more ambitious design. His plates, all neat in design,
are clear, skilful engraving. His work and that of Callender, in the
same style, resemble each other.

The following plates are signed by Rollinson:--

  Richard Harrison                      Plain armorial.
  Elias Hicks                           Ribbon and Wreath.
  George Ludlow                         Ribbon and Wreath.
  W. T. McCoun                          Plain armorial.
  Horatio Shepheard Moat                Ribbon and Wreath.
  New York College of Pharmacy          Ornamented label.
  James Adam Smith                      Plain armorial.
  Thomas N. Stanforth                   Ribbon and Wreath.
  Teachers’ Union, St. George’s Church  Engraved label.
  John W. Watkins, A.M.                 Ribbon and Wreath.
  Charles Wilkes                        Plain armorial.
  Azarias Williams                      Ribbon and Wreath.

J. SMITHERS, an Englishman, originally a gun-engraver employed in the
Tower of London, came to Philadelphia in the year 1773.

[Illustration: H. E. Deats.]

He had a good name as a man and as an engraver, and made the blocks for
the Continental money. A large plan of the city of Philadelphia on three
plates, which was his work, was subsequently purchased, when copper was
scarce, for thirty dollars, and cut up into smaller pieces. Among his
pupils was Trenchard, of whose work we have a few examples.

The following plates are signed by Smithers:--

  John Day             Plain armorial.
  Fenwick              Chippendale.
  Henry Hale Graham    Plain armorial.
  John Magill          Chippendale.
  Henry McMurtrie      Pictorial.

He sometimes signed with the final _s_, and sometimes without it. His
book-plates are not especially brilliant in any way, but are good, and
in the pure style. His finest attempt is the landscape plate for _Dr.
McMurtrie_ of Philadelphia.

       *       *       *       *       *

T. SPARROW was an obscure engraver on wood, who worked at his trade in
Annapolis from 1765 to about 1780, and who did considerable work for
“Ann Catherine Green & Son, Printers,” of that town, on title-pages,
tail-pieces, etc. He engraved on copper the title-page for the “Deputy
Commissary’s Guide of Maryland,” published by the above firm in 1774,
and which is a creditable piece of work. All the book-plates known at
present are on wood, and they are but two in number: the _Richard
Sprigg_ and the _Gabriel Duvall_, both of whom were men of prominence in
the colonial times, in Maryland.

       *       *       *       *       *

WILLIAM D. TERRY, who was mentioned as the founder, with Pelton, of the
Bank-Note Company, in Boston, engraved a plate for the _Redwood
Library_, of Newport. This is a large representation of the library, and
is a fine piece of work.

       *       *       *       *       *

JAMES THACKARA was a partner of John Vallance, in the engraving
business, and they were together for a good many years. Thackara was
inferior to his partner as an engraver, according to Dunlap, and was for
a long time the keeper of the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts.

We know but one example of his book-plate work, and that is the
_Lenthall_ plate, which is a large and very interesting example of the
Ribbon and Wreath style. It is an excellent piece of engraving, full of
style, and graceful in design.

       *       *       *       *       *

JAMES TRENCHARD was born in Cumberland County, New Jersey, about 1746.
He was a pupil of Smithers, and engraved in Philadelphia,

[Illustration: JOHN LENTHALL]

about 1785. Among his pupils were Thackara, Vallance, and his nephew,
Edward Trenchard, who became an officer in the United States Navy, and
served in the War of 1812.

Trenchard was one of the owners of the “Columbian Magazine,” published
in Philadelphia from 1786 to 1792, and he engraved many plates for its
pages.

[Illustration: Bloomfield]

One signed book-plate of his is known,--the _Bloomfield_. This is a
Chippendale plate of no striking features. The _Luther Martin_ plate is
so similar to this as to leave hardly any doubt that it too was by
Trenchard.

JAMES TURNER is another of the early American artists of whom very
little is known now. He was at one time in Boston, but later removed to
Philadelphia. He did some portrait and some music work. Of his
book-plate work we have but three signed specimens. By far the most
interesting and valuable of these is the extremely rare plate of _John
Franklin of Boston in New England_. This is very fully described in the
List of Early American Book-plates. The other plates are the _Sir John
St. Clair_, and the plate for _Isaac Norris_, of the family of the
Quaker Chief Justice of Pennsylvania.

[Illustration: John Franklin

Boston New England]

The plate of _James Hall_, although not signed, is also attributed to
him.

       *       *       *       *       *

JOHN VALLANCE, whose name is connected with that of Thackara, engraved
with him many plates for Dobson’s Encyclopædia. He made heads of
Franklin and Howard, which were pronounced successful, and he had a high
reputation as an engraver.

[Illustration: Bloomfield Maine.]

One authenticated example of his book-plate work is known, the _Joseph
Wiseman_, in the Ribbon and Wreath style; and the _David Brearly_,
although not signed, is attributed to him.

       *       *       *       *       *

Of the other engravers whose names appear on but one or two plates, no
information has been obtained. There were probably many who had but a
local fame, and who made but a few plates. Their names are remembered
now in a way not expected at the time of signing them, undoubtedly.

       *       *       *       *       *

In a recent article on COUNT RUMFORD, in the “New England Magazine,” it
is said that, when a youth, he designed book-plates. No authentic
examples of his work are known, and no information can be obtained
concerning any.

       *       *       *       *       *

JACOB HURD, the father of Nathaniel, was a goldsmith of Boston, and his
name is on pieces of plate in the First and Second churches in Boston,
and the First Church, and Christ Church, in Dorchester. He very probably
made book-plates, though no signed work is known. He died in 1758. He
appears in the list of subscribers to “Prince’s Chronological History of
New England,” as taking six copies.

In the “Boston Evening Post,” for March 4, 1745, the following
advertisement appears:--

     “FRANCIS GARDEN, Engraver from London, engraves in the newest
     Manner and at the cheapest Rates, Coats-of-Arms, Crests or Cyphers
     on Gold, Silver, Pewter or Copper. To be heard of at Mr.
     Caverley’s, Distiller, at the South End of Boston. N.B. He will
     wait on any Person in Town or Country, to do their Work at their
     own House, if desired: also copper-plate printing perform’d by
     him.”

No signed example of this gentleman’s work has thus far come to our
knowledge. It is fair to presume, however, that he engraved book-plates.

A LIST OF EARLY AMERICAN BOOK-PLATES.


The following List of Early American Book-plates makes no claim to
completeness: indeed it is earnestly hoped and believed that time will
prove it to be quite incomplete: old plates new to collectors are
continually coming to light, and there is every reason to expect their
number to increase. We are persuaded that certain of the worthies of
colonial times used book-plates, although no copies are now known, and
that some future investigator will unearth these much-desired treasures.

Some plates will be found included which do not have a satisfactory
description: this is due to their not being seen by the compiler of the
List: correspondents at a distance cannot always send full details, and
without them it is better to attempt little in the way of description.
The aim has been to be accurate and as full as possible. There are
hundreds of simple name-labels which have no place here, but all
armorial examples which could be discovered are mentioned.

The plates are given in alphabetical order, and are numbered for
convenience in reference. As far as possible, the first line of the
description of each plate gives the exact wording of the original, with
its spelling and abbreviations: the mottoes also, as well as the manner
of signature, are given exactly as they appear on the original plate:
wherever throughout this List _italics_ are used, they denote the exact
language employed upon the plate.


1. ANONYMOUS.

Armorial. A very beautiful plate with French arms: a crown above
and military trophies behind the shield: French banners, cannon,
quivers of arrows, anchor, horns, swords, drum, tomahawks, bugle,
lances, etc. Signed, _Maingot delt. Maverick_, _Sct._

[Illustration: Richard C. Lichtenstein.]

[Illustration]

2. ABERCROMBIE. _James Abercrombie._

Armorial. Ribbon and Wreath. Two mottoes, _Vive ut vivas_, and _Meus in
arduis aequa_. Of Philadelphia, and mentioned in Boswell’s “Life of Dr.
Johnson.”

3. ADAMS. _John Adams._

Armorial. The Boylston arms. The shield surrounded by a garter on which
the motto is given,--_Libertatem amicitiam retenebis et fidem_. The
whole design surrounded by thirteen stars. Second President of the
United States.

4. ADAMS. _John Quincy Adams._

Simply the name rudely engraved and surrounded by a narrow line.
Probably the first of the J. Q. A. book-plates. Sixth President of the
United States.

5. ADAMS. _John Quincy Adams._

Armorial. Boylston arms. Ribbon and Wreath. Motto-ribbon empty.

6. ADAMS. _John Quincy Adams._

Armorial. The Boylston arms; the shield enclosed within a garter, on
which the motto appears,--_Fidem--Libertatem--Amicitiam_.

7. ADAMS. _John Quincy Adams._

Armorial. The shield is quartered, and bears in the first quarter a
curious specimen of home-made heraldry. The ancestors of the President
bore no arms, and in their place appears a stag standing at gaze before
a pine tree, while below in the water a fish, probably a cod, is
swimming; the whole design surrounded with thirteen stars. This was his
own invention. The other quarters bear the Smith, Quincy, and Boylston
arms. The whole shield is surrounded by a garter bearing the motto
_Fidem, Libertatem, Amicitiam retinebis_. From “Tacitus.”

8. AGAR. _Property, Lydia Agar. 1806._

Pictorial. An eagle bears a broad ribbon, on which the word _property_
is given; an oval frame encloses what resembles a row of eggs.

9. AGNEW. _James Agnew, Esq._

Armorial. Chippendale. Motto, _Consilio non impetu_. Attributed to
Maverick.

10. AITKIN. _Robert Aitkin._

Simple name label: the printer of the “Aitkin Bible.” Philadelphia,
1782. The first American edition.

11. ALBANY. _Albany Society Library. 1759._

A peculiar plate something in the shape of the figure 8, with
intertwining foliations above and at the sides. The upper part of the
frame is the larger, and contains a spirited illustration of an Indian
in ambush aiming an arrow at a leaping fox. On the frame surrounding
this is the motto, _May concord prevail and the undertakeing prosper_.
In the lower and smaller part is depicted a prim man, bewigged and
ruffled, with an open book in his hand; presumably a patron of the
Library. Very little can be learned concerning this early Library. It
was probably interrupted by the Revolution. Some of its books are in the
New York State Library.

12. ALLAN. _John Allan._

Pictorial. An open book, across the pages of which is printed the name
of the owner. Behind all an anchor. This is the plate of the old book
collector of New York City.

13. ALLEN. _John Allen._

Armorial. Jacobean. Motto, _Law & Right_. This is believed to be the
plate used by John Allen, an early bookseller of Boston. He published
the “News-Letter.” From the general design and the crude engraving, it
must be taken for early American work: circa 1720. Illustrated in
“Curio,” page 15.

14. ALLISON. _Joseph J. Allison._

Armorial. Chippendale. Hour-glass, books, globe, palette, and brushes,
grouped above the escutcheon. Motto, _Hinc labor et virtus_. Of
Philadelphia.

15. ALSOP. _Richard Alsop._

Armorial. Belongs to no particular style, although the ornamentation is
of Chippendale tendency. Beneath the shield, at either side, stands a
cupid holding out a bunch of arrows: the drawing of these figures is not
above criticism: they seem to have one arm each, and but one wing also.
A Connecticut poet. Born, 1761; died, 1815. One of the famous “Hartford
Wits.”

16. AMBLER. Armorial. Of Virginia.

17. AMERICAN. _American Academy of Arts and Sciences. MDCCLXX._

A very handsome plate, having a large curtain looped back by ribbons and
cords, whereon to record the name of the giver of books to the library,
and above this an oval vignette representing Minerva with shield and
spear in hand, and helmet on her head, standing upon the sea-shore (of
Massachusetts), watching a three-master which sails far away under a
glaring sun and a heavy cloud: through a corn-field and then through the
woods lies the path to the distant village whose roofs can be seen: on
the sand about the goddess lie scattered the scientific and agricultural
implements, the uses of which it was the function of the Academy to
teach. The Academy was instituted in 1779. Very good engraving but not
so good drawing. The work is attributed to Callender.

18. ANDERSON. _Alexr. Anderson._

Armorial. Chippendale. Motto, _Vigila_. Signed, _A. Anderson, Sculp._
The original plate had only the last name engraved; the first name was
added afterwards and evidently by a different hand. This plate is
sometimes found with the name of his brother, John, written in before
the family name, indicating perhaps that the plate was designed for the
general use of the family. This is the plate of Dr. Anderson, the first
engraver in wood in America.

19. ANDOVER. _Institutio Theologica Andover. Fundata MDCCCVII._

A severely plain pediment, raised upon Doric columns, bearing on the
architrave the name. A blaze of glory above has in the centre the words,
יהוה. Similar rays shine over the open Bible at the foot, on which is
written, PS. CXIX, 169, and JOH. XVII, 17. On the base are the words,
ΑΚΟΓΩΝΙ ΣΟΥ ΧΡΙΚΤΟΥ.

20. ANDREW. _John Andrew._

Pictorial. The implements of the engraver lie scattered upon the bench:
the name is given in fac-simile of the autograph.

21. ANDREWS. Armorial. Of Virginia.

22. ANDREWS.---- _Andrews._ (First name obliterated.)

Pictorial. The scene is out of doors and the sun rises in full strength
behind a long oval frame on which the name is engraved. A little patch
of earth, two well-grown trees, and scant herbage complete the
accessories. Signed, _Callender Sc._

23. ANDREWS. _Eliza Andrews._

Pictorial. Exactly the same as the succeeding, with the exception of the
change in the name and the omission of the engraver’s signature.

24. ANDREWS. _Henry Andrews._

Pictorial: representing Minerva, crowned, with spear and shield: the owl
sits upon a convenient pedestal. The name of the owner is put upon the
edge of the shield which the goddess rests upon the ground. Signed, _S.
Harris. Sc._

25. ANTILL. _Edwad. Antill. Esqr., A.M._

Armorial. Chippendale. Motto, _Probitas laudatur et alget_. A New Jersey
author. Illustrated in “Art Amateur,” April, 1894.

26. APTHORP. _Apthorp._

Armorial. Chippendale. Motto-ribbon empty.

27. APTHORP. _East Apthorp, A.M. Cambridge MDCCLXI._

Armorial. Late Jacobean. Motto, _Nemo nisi Christus_. Eminent Episcopal
divine, born in Boston, 1733; educated at Cambridge, and died, 1816.

28. APTHORP. _Jno. Apthorp._

Armorial. Chippendale. Motto, _Fari quae sentiat_. The same plate as the
one mentioned above as having the motto-ribbon empty. In this example
the name _Jno._ is written, and so is the motto.

29. APTHORP. _Thomas Apthorp._

Armorial. Chippendale. Motto, _Juste rem para_. Flowers, and a huge bee
in the decoration. Printed in blue ink. Born, 1741. Died in England.

30. ARCHDEACON. _S. Archdeacon._

Armorial. Chippendale. Motto, _Esse quam videri_. Signed, _W. S._ A
pretty design, with the caduceus of Mercury introduced in the
ornamentation.

31. ARCHER. _William Archer._

Armorial. Of Chesterfield County, Virginia.

32. ARCHER. _William Archer, Powhatan._ A plain label with the name
within a type border.

33. ARMISTEAD. _William Armistead._

Armorial. Of Virginia. Of Revolutionary fame.

34. ASHWELL. _Charles Ashwell of Grenada._ Plain armorial.

35. ASSHETON. _Ralph Assheton, M.D., Philadelphia._

Councillor; studied medicine in Edinburgh.

36. ASSHETON. _Willm. Assheton Esqr. of Barbadoes._

Armorial. Chippendale. Very ornate. No motto. Began the practice of law
in Penna., and was afterwards described as “of the Parish of St.
Michael’s in Barbadoes, gentleman.” He was Provost-Marshal of Barbadoes.

of Admiralty of Penn. 1718._ Arms, crest, and quarterings.

38. ATKINSON. _Theodore Atkinson._

Armorial. Chippendale. No motto. Signed, _N. Hurd. Scp._ This is the
same design that was used in the Wentworth plate, but is much better in
execution. The peculiar flow of water from the shell beneath the
escutcheon is caught in a bowl: the only instance. Secretary of the
colony of New Hampshire, 1741; Chief Justice, 1754; Major-General of
militia, 1769; delegate to Congress at Albany, 1754.

39. ATKINSON. _William King Atkinson._

Armorial. Chippendale: a copy of the preceding design. Motto, _Nil
facimus non sponte Dei._ Signed, _Callender Sc._ A noted lawyer of
Portsmouth, N.H. (1764-1820). Changed his name from King to Atkinson out
of respect to Judge Atkinson.

40. ATLEE. _Willm. Augs. Atlee Esqr. of Lancaster PENNSYLVANIA._

Armorial. Chippendale. Motto-ribbon empty; bears some marks of being
unfinished. Judge of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, 1777-1791.

from the beak of the eagle bears the motto, _Sublimiora petamus_;
beneath, a three-masted vessel, with homing pennant streaming, passes
half-submerged trees and a chain of mountain peaks. Signed, _Maverick
Sculp’_.

52. BANCKER. _Charles N. Bancker._

Armorial in style, but showing no actual arms. The shield is occupied by
a large figure 4, which is an old “merchant mark.” Chippendale. Puffy
cupids are seated on either side of the frame with accessories which
indicate the pursuit of science. Motto, _Dieu Defend le Droit_. Signed,
_Jones Sc._ Of Philadelphia.

53. BANCKER. _Charles N. Bancker._

A Chippendale frame enclosing the figure 4, and showing the same motto
as the above. Helmet, wreath and crest, the eagle’s wings erect, ppr.
Not signed.

54. BANCKER. _Evert Bancker, Junr._

A smaller and older plate than the others of this name, and showing the
same figure 4, with rather wild mantling, and crest.

55. BANCKER. _Gerard Bancker._

Chippendale. A cupid holding a globe converses with a companion, perhaps
about commerce and ocean currents; behind them a pyramid rises, and two
other cupids are consulting a plan. The figure 4 is again prominent in
this plate. Signed, _Dawkins Sculpsit_.

56. BANCROFT. _George Bancroft._

Pictorial. A chubby cherub approaches, with a panel in his hands on
which the words ΕΙΣ ΦΑΟΣ are given. Another plate, identical in all
other details, gives the motto, _Sursum corda_. Historian of the United
States.

Plain armorial. (arms of Banester of Easington, County York, according
to Burke). No motto. Of Virginia. Revolutionary soldier. Died, 1787.

58. BARRELL. _Joseph Barrell._

An allegorical plate full of detail. In the centre is the shield with
the arms, while above the crest sits Hope with her anchor. As indicative
of Industry, a very trim female figure is presented, surrounded by
signs of prosperity, such as the beehive, palette and brush, and square
and dividers. In contrast to this a bare-footed, raggedly clad woman
with a dead fish in her lap, snails on her shoulders, broken tools
around her, and with every appearance of misery and squalor, is shown at
the left. The contrast between Thrift and Indolence is continued in a
second series of pictures below the shield. In these it is the begging
tramp and the erect, well-clothed gentleman who depict the moral.
Dilapidated shanties and well-built houses are also in contrast.

pioneer in the Northwest coast trade.

_In Reason’s balance try the works of man;_

_Nor, Servile, Yield opinion to a Name._

Signed, _Engrd. by P. R. Maverick 65 Liberty Street_. As the name _Jacob
Brown_ is not engraved, but is printed by hand, it is quite likely that
this plate was for promiscuous use; either to be filled up with the name
of any who ordered it, or to be pasted in the books sold by some
bookseller.

111. BROWN. _John Carter Brown._ Crest only. Motto, _Gaudeo_.

112. BROWN. _Thomas Brown._

rests upon the books, and the all-seeing eye looks upon the scene from
above. Signed, _Engraved by James Akin_. A prominent lawyer in

Armorial. Jacobean. A very interesting specimen of its class. The
profuse mantling thrown high in the air, the shell-lined background, and
the curtain upheld at the ends (on which the name and address are given)
are prominent characteristics as pointed out by Warren. A rich abundance
of fruit overflows from two cornucopiæ, and the motto-ribbon is twined
in and out through the scrolls at the base. Motto, _Nulla pallescere
culpa_. Colonel Byrd was a very distinguished Virginian: was born to an
ample fortune, liberally educated, and became the patron of science and
literature in his native state. President of the Council of the colony;

centre of the design a flaming heart rests upon the shank of an anchor.
A thin patch of ground, which grows a few trees, and looks like an
island, upholds these emblems of hope. The motto is just above,--_Spes
mea in Deo_. Above this again the all-seeing eye, wreathed in clouds,
appears. The whole is enclosed in a design of Ribbon and Wreath
arrangement. Evidently the work of Brooks, who engraved the plate of Dr.
I. Dove of the same city.

125. CABELL. _Samuel Jordan Cabell, of Soldier’s Joy._ Pictorial. The
name is printed from type upon a large oval medallion; this is supported

Signed, _J. Akin del. F. Kearny Sc._ Of Boston.

175. COFFIN. _John Coffin. 1771._

Armorial. A frame of Jacobean tendencies. Motto-ribbon empty. Of
Massachusetts.

Plain armorial. Motto, _Fais bien crains rien_. Mayor of New York City
in 1818. Friend and coadjutor of De Witt Clinton.

177. COLUMBIA COLLEGE. _Columbia College Library New York._

Allegorical. The scene is out-of-doors; a throne placed on rising ground
is occupied by the Goddess of Learning; the Shekinah blazes above and
the rising sun peeps over the horizon. Three little nude beginners in
learning stand before the Goddess, in whose hand an open book is
extended bearing the motto, Λογια Ζὡνζα. From her mouth a scroll issues
bearing in Hebrew the motto, אוריאר _Let there be light_. Beneath this
scene is the reference _I Pet. II I. 2 &c._ The name of the library
appears upon the circular frame which encloses the whole scene; the
motto, _In lumine tuo videbimus lumen_, follows the inner line of the
circle. Above, an urn is overfilled with the blossoms of knowledge,
while the background of the whole is a brick wall. Signed, _Anderson
sculp._

178. CONNECTICUT THEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE. _Theol. Institute of Con. 1833.
Presented by_

Pictorial. The representation is of a pulpit with winding stairs on
either side, and a very tall solemn-looking sounding-board behind it,
partially hid by a curtain. The front panel of the pulpit has the
following, ΚΗΡΥΣΣΟΜΕΝ ΧΡΙΣΤΟΝ ἙΣΤΑΥΡΩΜΕΝ.

179. CONNECTICUT THEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE. _Society of Inquiry. Theological
Institute of Connecticut._ Three book shelves disclosed by a drawn
curtain.

180. CONNOLLY. _Charles M. Connolly._

Armorial. Motto, _En Dieu est tout_. Signed, _J. G. Bolen, 104 B’way._

181. CONSTABLE. _William Constable._

Plain armorial. Motto, _Post tot Naufragia portus_. Of the early New
York family that owned large estates near Utica, N.Y. This plate is
circa 1783 and was engraved in New York. It is interesting as a specimen
of twisted heraldry; the correct arms are “Quarterly, gu. and vaire,
over all a bend or.” (Flamburgh. Co. York, descended from Robert De
Lacy, second son of John De Lacy, Baron of Halton, and Constable of
Chester). See Burke. In this plate the arms are “Quarterly vaire and gu.
over all a bend sinister or.,” which are manifestly incorrect. It was
not probably the purpose of the engraver to make this alteration, but
not understanding heraldic drawing he drew the arms correctly on the
copper, which reversed them in the print.

182. COOLEY. _Abial A. Cooley’s Property._

An elaborate plate of its kind, which is unusual; it is regular
die-sinker’s work, and is printed in red ink. The word _Property_ is on
a ribbon which is arched over a peacock and a dove; scrolls abound in
convenient places. The only copy seen is in a Boston imprint. 1742.

183. COOPER. _Myles Cooper LL.D. Coll. Regis Nov. Ebor. in America.
Praefes, et Coll. Reginae de Oxon. Socius &c._

Armorial. Chippendale. No motto. Second President of King’s College (now
Columbia). His Loyalist inclinations resulted in a hasty flight from the
college; he escaped to England, where he was an honored preacher.
Illustrated in “Art Amateur,” April, 1894.

184. COURTENAY. _Henry Courtenay._

Armorial. Chippendale. No motto. Very similar in style to the Philip
Dumaresque. Not signed, but undoubtedly by Hurd. Of Massachusetts.

A name-label with the skull and crossed bones above the name. The motto,

187. CRANCH. _Richd. Cranch. Braintree._

An engraved label. The name is within an oval frame, formed of oak and
laurel leaves. This plate was engraved by William Bond of Falmouth (now
Portland), in 1786. Richard Cranch was a brother-in-law of John Adams,
and lived in Quincy, and also in the adjoining town of Braintree.

family--builder of “Arlington.” Son of the following.

Armorial. Presumably assumed arms; arg. an eagle displayed ppr. Crest,
an eagle’s head erased ppr. Chippendale. No motto. Son of Mrs.
Washington by her first husband, Daniel Parke Custis. The engraver
omitted the _e_ from the middle name.

197. CUTTING. _James S. Cutting._

Armorial. Ribbon and Wreath. Motto, _Postero ne credo_. Signed,
_Maverick Sct._ Of New York.

198. CUTTING. _William Cutting._

199. CUYLER. _John Cuyler._

Armorial. Ribbon and Wreath. Motto-ribbon empty. Signed, _Maverick
Sculpt._ Of New York.

200. DANA. _Edmund Trowbridge Dana._

upper left-hand corner the date _A.D. 1569_ is given. Presumably the
date of the grant of arms. Son of R. H. Dana. Translator and editor of
works on International Law.

201. DANA. _Francis Dana._

Armorial. Chippendale. Motto, _Cavendotutus_. Signed, _N. H. Scp._ A

the name is changed to the present user. Poet and essayist.

203. DANFORTH. _Danforth._

Armorial. Chippendale. Motto, _Ubi plura offendar maculis nitent non ego
paucis_. Signed, _N. H. Scp._ At the upper left-hand corner, outside the
design, the sun shines in full strength. Presumably the plate of Dr.
Samuel Danforth of Boston. Born, 1740; died, 1827.

204. DARTMOUTH COLLEGE. _Library of Dartmouth College. Presented by
Isaiah Thomas Esq A.D. 1819 in his Donation of 470 Volumes._

disposed in an oval.

volume. Motto, _Sol sapientiae nunquam occidet_. The full sun above the
shield.

206. DAVENPORT. Armorial. Of Virginia.

207. DAVIDSON. _Henry Davidson._

Armorial. Ribbon and Wreath. Motto, _Sapienter si sincere_. A very neat
plate. The wreath has not the proper twisted effect, but appears more
like a row of eggs than an heraldic wreath.

208. DAVIS. _Davis._

Plain armorial. Motto, _Auspice Christo_.

209. DAY. _John Day._

Plain armorial. Signed, _J. Smithers. Sculp._ Of Philadelphia.

210. DAY. _M. W. Day._

Pictorial. A collection of literary property is grouped in an open space
where the rising sun shines strongly; the name is given upon a ribbon
which floats above; from it depends a lamp; to the right, a book-case;
to the left, a bust of Franklin, a large globe, books, ink-pot and
quills; in front, an unrolled parchment which purports to be a list of
books. The following motto:--

    _’Tis education forms the common mind,_
    _Just as the twig is bent, the tree’s inclined._

Signed, _W. Chapin del & Sc._

211. DEANE. _John Deane._

Armorial. Ribbon and Wreath. No motto. Name on motto-ribbon.

212. DE BLOIS. _Lew’s. De Blois._

Armorial. Jacobean. No motto. Signed, _Nathaniel Hurd Sculp._ The
mantling is well conceived but rudely engraved; the shell-lined
background is here, and the curtain upheld at the corners, on which the
name is given. The whole appearance of the plate shows it to be quite
early, and among the first attempts of Hurd.

213. DE BLOIS. _N.J. De Blois._

Armorial. Jacobean, with handsome mantling. Motto, _Je me fie en Dieu_.
“These arms are assumed by some members of the family of this name
living in Newport, R.I. The first of the name in America was born in
Fort George, N.Y., some time before the Revolution; his descendants in
New York and Newport carried on a great hardware business with their
parents in England, but when the troubles occurred they became Tories
and left the country. Some of the wax seals on their old letters bear
the impression of a Moor’s head, which may have been correct. Others had
either the conceit or ignorance to assume the armorial bearings of the
famous and noble family of Châtillon of France, which historical race
became extinct in 1762. As, during the 14th century some members of the
Châtillons were Comtes de Blois, this title, extinct in 1364, over 500
years ago, is most unwarrantably used as if it were the family name, and
the Châtillon arms adopted in a most extraordinary way, reversing the
ordinary way of acquiring arms; so audacious and arrogant is the
assumption and so sublime the impudence it entitles the fact to a high
place in the Curiosities of Heraldry.” (These notes are found
accompanying the copy of the plate in the collection of the late Mr.
James Eddy Mauran.) This plate is apparently copied from the one by
Hurd, and as that is much earlier, it may be that the assumption of the
arms was due to him instead of to the later users, who simply copied
what appeared to be the legitimate plate and arms of an ancestor.

214. DEDHAM. _Library of the “Young Men’s and Young Ladies’ Societies
for the Study of the Sacred Scriptures.” Dedham, (Ms)._

The above inscription is printed from type within an oval frame which is
cut on wood; elongated cornucopiæ extend their blossoms above and around
the central panel; above in a small frame a lute and some music books.

215. DENNY. _William Denny._

Armorial. Motto, _Et mea messis erit_. Governor of the Province of
Pennsylvania.

216. DE PEYSTER. _Frederick De Peyster._

Armorial. A plain, heart-shaped shield supported by two eagles on palm
branches, which are crossed under the shield and extend upwards on
either side. No motto. Signed, _P. R. Maverick Sct._ Of New York.
Illustrated in “Art Amateur,” February, 1894.

217. DERBY. _Martha Derby._

The name printed within a border of flowers and sprays. A group of
musical instruments above.

218. DERING. _Nicoll H. Dering._

Armorial. No motto. The Thomas Dering plate by Hurd, with the name
altered.

219. DERING. _Thomas Dering._

Armorial. Chippendale. No motto. Signed, _N. Hurd Sculp 1749_. This is
the earliest plate by an American engraver which is both signed and
dated. But one copy is known at this writing. Illustrated in “Curio,”
page 14.

220. DERING. _Thomas Dering._

Crest only, enclosed within a circular ring. The half-date _17--_ is
given. Resembles the work of Hurd somewhat.

221. DE WITT. _Richard Varick De Witt._

A small pictorial plate, representing Minerva standing helmeted and with
spear and shield in hand. On some copies of this plate the following
additional inscription is found engraved, _From his uncle Richard
Varick_.

222. DEXTER. _Samuel Dexter’s. MDCCLXXXV._

A printed label, with a border of ornamental type. Eminent lawyer and
statesman. Secretary of War 1800, and Secretary of the Treasury, 1801.

223. DILL. _John E. Dill. Boston._

A name-label in which the name is printed within a border made up of
ornamental type, although it does not look so at first glance. The back
of the design resembles a brick wall; the frame is made up of bouquets
in holders, hearts, and an assortment of odds and ends.

224. DINWIDDIE. _Rob’t. Dinwiddie._

Armorial. Chippendale. Motto, _Ubi libertas ibi patria_.
Lieutenant-Governor of Virginia, 1751-1758. See “Ex Libris Journal,”
Vol. II, pages 89, 125.

225. DOLBEARE. _Benjamin Dolbeare of Boston in New England. Oxford.
Printed at the Clarendon Printing House. October 6, 1739._

A very large printed label, with three rows of ornamental type border,
between which the following is printed, “The Noble Art and Mystery of
PRINTING was first Invented by JOHN GUTTENBERG of _Mentz_, a City of
_Germany_ in the YEAR 1440 and brought into ENGLAND by JOHN ISLIP of
_London_ in the year of our LORD 1471.” This is very like the plate of
Martha Bartlett, illustrated in “The Book-plate Collectors’ Miscellany,”
page 20. See note from Mr. Tuer in same, page 29. There was an Edward
Dolbier in the Boston Tea-party, 16th December, 1773.

226. DOVE. _Doct. I. Dove. Richmond. Virga._

Armorial. Crest only. A dove ppr. holding an olive branch in her bill.
Motto, _Deus providebit_. The design is completed by a festoon and
crossed branches in Ribbon and Wreath style. Signed, _Brooks Sculp._ The
Doct. Cabell plate was evidently the work of this same engraver.

227. DOVE. _Samuel E. Dove. Richmond. Va._

Pictorial. The dove with the olive branch in her bill flies past
mountains with water at their foot. Motto, _Ab initio Deus providebit_,
on a circular garter enclosing the picture.

228. DRAYTON. _Drayton, South Carolina._

Armorial. Ribbon and Wreath. Motto, _Non nobis solum_.

229. DRAYTON. _Jacob Drayton, South Carolina._

The same copper as the above with the first name added.

230. DRAYTON. _Wm. Drayton, Middle Temple._

the preceding, with the same arms. The name and address are given in a
bracket bordered with scrolls and foliations. A jurist of South Carolina
and Florida.

231. DRAYTON. _William Henry Drayton._

Armorial. Statesman. Born at Drayton Hall-on-the-Ashley, near
Charleston, S.C., 1742; died, 1779.

232. DUANE. _James Duane. Esqr._

Armorial. Chippendale. Motto, _Nulli praeda_. Signed, _H. D. fect._ The
usual pictorial elements of Dawkins’ style are here introduced. The prim
shepherdess and attendant swain on one side of the shield, and a lonely
young girl singing to herself by a fountain, to the music of her guitar;
her home cannot be far away as she wears no hat and is in décolleté
attire. Of New York. Statesman. Member of the Old Congress. Illustrated
in “Art Amateur,” March, 1894.

233. DUDLEY. _Joseph Dudley 1754._

Armorial. Early English. The mantling is very full, curling upwards as
well as downward and completely envelopes the shield. It is the common
type of denticulated mantling, but not so elegant as some examples.
Motto, _Nec gladio nec arcu_. The name appears on the usual scroll
beneath the shield. Of the family of the Governor of the colony of
Massachusetts. This date, _1754_, was added by Hurd, and is much later
than the actual date of the plate.

234. DUER. _E Libris Gul. Alex. Duer._

Plain armorial. Motto, _Esse et videri_. Of New York. Brother-in-law of
Beverly Robinson. President of Columbia College from 1829 to 1842. Son
of following.

235. DUER. _Willm. Duer. Esq._

Armorial in form. Crest only. Ribbon and Wreath. Motto, _Esse quam
videri_. Attributed to Maverick: the frame strongly resembles the
Maturin Livingston. The name is on the shield. Born, 1747. Delegate to
Continental Congress.

236. DUMARESQUE. _Philip Dumaresque._

Armorial. Chippendale. No motto. Signed, _N. Hurd. Sculp._ One of the
first officers of old Trinity Church in Boston.

237. DUMMER. _Jer. Dummer Anglus Americanus._

Armorial. Early English. No motto. In the diary of John Hull, the coiner
of the early specie of Massachusetts, the following entry is found:
“1659. 1st of 5th. I received into my house Jeremie Dummer and Samuel
Paddy, to serve me as apprentices eight years.” In the “Heraldic
Journal” we learn that Jeremiah Dummer was a goldsmith. Married in 1672
Hannah Atwater. He was the father of Governor William Dummer, and of
Jeremiah Dummer the younger, the probable owner of this plate, who was
Massachusetts agent in England, 1710-1721.

238. DUNCAN. _James H. Duncan._

Armorial. Ribbon and Wreath. Motto, _Disce pati_. Very crude work.

239. DUNKIN. _Robert Henry Dunkin._

Armorial. Motto, _Disce pati_. Signed, _I. H._ (Hutt.) Of Philadelphia.

240. DUNNING. _Charles E. Dunning._

Armorial. Chippendale. Motto, _Semper paratus_. Foliage, roses and a
griffin in the ornamentation.

241. DUNNING. _Charles S. Dunning._

Armorial. Impaling Wijnkoop. Chippendale. (Late.) Motto, _Semper
paratus_. More elaborate design than the above.

242. DURAND. _John Durand. Esqr._

Armorial. Chippendale. Very fine. Presumably by the brother of Asher B.
Durand, who was a fine engraver. A medallion beneath the shield shows
cupids in a corn-field.

243. DUVALL. _E Bibliotheca Gabrielis Duvall. A.D. 1778._

The name printed from type within a woodcut border, in which thirteen
stars form a patriotic allusion. Signed, _T. S._ (Sparrow.) Of Huguenot
descent. Born in Maryland, 1752. Jurist and Federal officer.

244. DYCKMAN. _Dyckman._

Armorial. Ribbon and Wreath. The crossed branches are under the shield,
and its edge is embellished with close festooning. _J. G._ written
before the name. Motto, _Zyt bestindig_. Illustrated in “Art Amateur,”
April, 1894.

245. DYCKMAN. _States Morris Dyckman._

Armorial. Ribbon and Wreath. Motto, _Zyt bestendig_.

246. EAST WINDSOR. _Miscellaneous Literary Association, East Windsor._

Allegorical. Minerva in repose. A Greek mask near by.

247. EDWARDS. _Bryan Edwards Esqr. Greenwich Park, Jamaica._

_Ashby Sculp, Russel Court, London_. Historian, and wealthy merchant in
Jamaica.

248. EDWARDS. _Charles Edwards._

Plain armorial. Motto, _The North against the World_. Lawyer and author
of New York. Born in 1797.

249. EDWARDS. _Isaac Edwards. North Carolina._

Armorial.

250. ELAM. _Samuel Elam. Rhode Island._

Armorial. Pictorial. A bit of landscape is introduced, and the shield
hangs from a ring around the bole of a shattered oak. A very pretty
design and well engraved, reminding one somewhat of the book-plates by
Bewick.

251. ELIOT. _William H. Eliot._

Armorial. Crest only, within an oval garter on which is given the motto,
_Non nobis solum_.

252. ELLERY. _Benjamin Ellery._

Armorial. Chippendale. No motto. Of New York. The same plate is found
bearing the name Harrison Ellery.

253. ELLIOTT. _Barnard Elliott._

Plain armorial. Colonel in the Revolution. Signed, _P. R. Maverick_.

254. ELLISTON. _Robert Elliston Gent. Comptrolr. of his Majesties
Customs of New York in America._

Armorial. Jacobean. A very handsome plate indeed, engraved in an
excellent manner. The shield is set against a diapered background, and
the ornamental moulding of the side is lined with shell-work; the shield
rests upon an upturned shell, and two eagles have alighted upon the
upper arms. The motto, _Bono vince malum_, is given upon a ribbon under
the frame, and there is no curtain or scroll to receive the inscription,
which is engraved plainly in three lines beneath all.

255. ELLISTON. _Robert Elliston Gent. Comptrolr. of his Majestie’s
Customs of New York in America._

This is very similar to the preceding, but is a trifle larger, and in
some respects superior. As before, the shield is placed within the
enfolding arms of a Jacobean frame, but the diapered pattern is
succeeded by an all-over shell pattern, and a grinning canephoros head
supports the shield. On a ribbon above the crest the date is given,
_M.DCC.XXV_. The motto, _Bono vince malum_, as before, is on its ribbon
under the frame. Again the usual curtain is omitted and the inscription
is engraved in three lines below all, with a little more attention to
grammatical marks, and in bolder type. The eagles have disappeared. The
copy before me has the following in handwriting:--_His gift to the
library of St. Georges’ Ch: in ... Queens County province of New York.
1730._ Illustrated in “Curio,” page 65.

256. EMERSON. _William Emerson._

Armorial. Ribbon and Wreath. The work looks very much like Callender’s.
Motto, _Fidem servabo_. Father of Ralph Waldo Emerson.

257. ERASMUS HALL. _Erasmus Hall Library._

Allegorical. Signed, _Maverick Sculpt New York_. The plate is divided
into two sections: the upper one is enclosed within a circular frame,
and contains the allegorical picture. Diana is seen in the foreground
directing the attention of a youth to the glories revealed upon the
heights above them. Two temples are seen which bear dedications to Fame
and to Virtue. Surrounded by clouds the angel of Fame is even now
appearing above her sacred fane. The implements of study are at the foot
of the youth, and under this scene are the words, FORTITER! ASCENDE. The
lower part of the design is simply a wreath enclosing the name. The
Erasmus Hall Library belonged to an Academy which was founded at
Flatbush, L.I., in 1786.

258. ERVING. _William Erving. Esqr._

Plain armorial. Mottoes, _Quo fata vocant_, and _Flourish in all
weathers_. Signed, _Callender Sct._ Undoubtedly of the Boston family of
Loyalists.

259. ERVING. (Anonymous.)

Plain armorial. Quartering, “Ar. an eagle displayed sa. within a border
invected of the last.” The first and third quarters are the Irvine arms.

[Illustration]

260. EUSTACE. _Colonel John Skey Eustace, State of New York._

Armorial. Ribbon and Wreath. Motto, _In hoc signo vinces_. The arms are
not correct, as one cross-crosslet is missing, and it is not certain
that the crest which hangs in unusual style on a plate, from the
festoon, belongs to this family. The crest is balanced by a plate on the
other side of the shield, on which a letter _E_ is engraved. The whole
is contained within an elongated wreath. The name appears above the
shield following the curve of the wreath, and at the bottom two
additional lines in Latin serve as another motto, _Ignotis errare
locis, ignota videre, Flumina gaudebat: studio minuente laborem_. A
variant of the above,--the same copper altered,--gives this motto in
place of _In hoc signo vinces,--Sans Dieu rien_. A Revolutionary officer
whose bravery was recognized by Congress.

261. EVARTS. _Jeremiah Evarts._

A simple name-label with the motto under the name and a festoon of cloth
above it. Motto, _Nil sine magno vita labore dedit mortalibus_. Father
of the Senator.

262. EVERDELL. _William Everdell._

Armorial in form, though no real arms are shown. Motto, _Semper
paratus_. The four quarters of the shield are occupied with implements
of the draughtsman’s art. Of New York.

263. EVERETT. _Edward Everett._

Plain armorial. Motto, _Patria veritas fides_. Scholar and orator. Born,
1780; died, 1851.

264. EWING. _Ewing._ (John.)

Armorial. Chippendale. A very porky lamb, books, two cooing doves, and a
quadrant are introduced into the framework. Motto, _Audacter_. A
Philadelphia clergyman.

265. FAIRFAX. _Bryan Fairfax._

Armorial. Motto, _Fare fac_. Eighth and last baron; friend of
Washington.

266. FARMINGTON. _Library in the First Society in Farmington._

A large engraved label.

267. FARMINGTON. _This Book belongs to Monthly Library in Farmington._

Allegorical. Signed, _M. Bull’s & T. Lee’s Sculp._ A large plate in
which the Laws and the names with the attendant flourishes take a good
deal of the space. In the centre a shelf of books separates two groups
of figures. At the right a very stiff youth, in the court costume of the
period, with wig, ruffles, and buckled shoes, is seen under the guidance
of a portly female figure who impersonates Wisdom.

[Illustration: J.H. Ewing]

She appears to be warning the youth of the dangers of pursuing the two
sirens who beam at him across the shelf; or else they are meant to
represent the sources of Knowledge, and the youth is being conducted
to them. As Deacon Bull was not a great engraver we may be pardoned if
we do not clearly understand his allegory. However, the LAWS of the
Library are very plain, and are neatly engraved under the row of books
mentioned.

  _1. Two pence pr day for retaining A Book more than a Month._
  _2. One penny for folding down a Leaf._
  _3. 3/ for lending a book to a Nonproprietor._
  _4. Other Damages apprais’d by a Committee._
  _5. No person allowed a Book while indebted for a Fine._

Below these stringent rules the following verse is given:--

    _The Youth, who, led by WISDOM’S guiding Hand,_
    _Seeks VIRTUE’S Temple, and her Laws Reveres:_
    _He, he alone, in HONOUR’S Dome shall Stand,_
    _Crown’d with Rewards, & rais’d above his Peers._

The design is very ambitious, but is rather poor in execution.

268. FARMINGTON. _Village Library._

Library Interior. A young lady, very prim, and exceptionally neat and
austere in her virtuous demeanor, sits upright in a chair beside a
table, on which a few books are laid, and an ink-pot with the quill in
it. An open case of books on the wall, a closed writing-desk under it,
and a print of Washington complete the furniture of the room. Out of the
window can be seen the inspiring sight of a steep hill, upon the summit
of which the pillared Temple of Honor stands.

The following verse is given:--

    _Beauties in vain their pretty eyes may roll:_
    _Charms strike the sense, but merit wins the soul._

Also of Farmington, Conn.

269. FAUQUIER. _Francis Fauquier. Esqr._

Armorial. Chippendale. No motto. Lieutenant-Governor of Virginia from
1758 to his death in 1768. Regarded by Jefferson as the ablest executive
of Virginia. Illustrated in “Art Amateur,” May, 1894.

videri_.

271. FENWICK. _Fenwick._

Armorial. Chippendale. Motto, _Perit ut vivat_. Signed, _J. Smither.

skill with the burin.

Plain armorial. Mantling. Motto, _Deus dabit_. Governor of New York
State, 1849-1851.

273. FISHER. _Joshua Fisher._

Delaware. A leading merchant of Philadelphia during the Revolution.

274. FITZHUGH. (Anonymous.)

Plain armorial. Motto, _Pro patria semper_. Of Virginia.

275. FITZHUGH. _Willm. Fitzhugh Junr._

Turner Sculp_. The shield rests upon a very elaborately ornamented
frame, the background of which is covered with a diaper pattern. As
supporters, Artemis, the goddess of the moon, with spear and arrow in
hands appears upon the left hand, and Apollo, likewise with spear,
attends upon the right. Both are represented with the lower part of the
figure diminishing into a vase, in the manner of the Termini. They stand
upon an ornamental bracket which encloses a sketch of Diana sounding the
hunter’s horn, while an attendant unleashes the hound. The points upon
which the figures of Artemis and Apollo rest are supported by female
busts in profile. The whole design is very ornate, and the plate is
perhaps the rarest of our early Americans. John Franklin was the brother
of Benjamin of greater fame.

Island, who was born November 8, 1770, and who died November 22, 1816.

rise on either side of the design.

Pictorial. The arms are carved upon a large fragment of the adjacent
ruins, and which lies at the base of a broken column. The ribbon under
the shield bears the motto, _Dictis factisque simplex_. A large tree
rises behind the broken column and cuts off the view, but a part of a
castle is visible, and between it and the fore view a knight on
horseback assisted by one on foot is chasing a wild boar, which is a
plain reference to the charge on the shield. Signed, _C. G. Childs_.
Attorney-General of the United States. 1840-1841.

A plate so nearly identical with the preceding as to be taken for it

a background he has a powder-horn, drum, lances, and the British flag.

[Illustration: John Goelet]

merchant. This plate is from the same copper as the Jean Louis Gourgas,
which is a French plate seen in several collections.

and pretty plate. A wealthy merchant of Boston; of a branch of the Rhode
Island family.

327. GREENE. _Benjamin Greene. 1757._

The same copper as the above but with the date _1757_ added beneath the

engraving, although very likely the correct date. Signature unchanged.
Illustrated in “Art Amateur,” April, 1894.

328. GREENE. _B. D. Greene._

Armorial. Ribbon and Wreath. No motto. A small plate, very neat in

it not_, is printed between the borders. A woodcut pattern of festooning
and sprays of flowers encloses the whole. Signed, _William Greenough
fecit_.

333. GREENWOOD. _Isaac Greenwood._

Pictorial. An anchor enclosed within a circular frame which bears the
name; slight foliations within the frame. Resembles an old printer’s
mark somewhat.

334. GRIGGS. _A. Griggs Philadelphia._

Pictorial. In a position quite impossible to imagine outside of the
picture, are three books thrown upon a huge rock, holding a scroll
outspread, which hangs down over a rushing brook. Indeed, one corner of
the scroll dips into the water; a few brushes and stunted or dead trees
complete the landscape. This is a woodcut in the style of Anderson.

335. GUILFORD LIBRARY. _Guilford Library._

Literary. Motto, _Improve your hours for they never return_. A shelf of
books very similar to that in the plate of George Goodwin, has a cloth
festoon looped above it; the motto is on a circle enclosing the winged
hourglass; the scroll-work above this is made into the form of a face.
This plate closely resembles that of the Stepney Society, in
Wethersfield, which is by Doolittle, and leads to the conclusion that
this is also his work. In 1737 the towns of Guilford, Saybrook,
Killingsworth, and Lyme formed a Library Association. It was dissolved a
little before 1800, and Guilford formed one by itself: at about the same
time the young people of the town started a library, and these two were
united in 1823 and formed the Union Library whose plate is noticed
below.

336. GUILFORD. _Union Library._

Pictorial. The American eagle, with shield, olive branch, bunch of
arrows, and the ribbon with the motto, _E pluribus unum_, is printed
from a woodcut; the motto, _Improve your hours for they never return_,
is printed from type beneath.

and a Gainsborough hat with a stick thrust through it are seen in the

Of Baltimore.

jessant-de-lys, orgeant. Crest, a talbot’s head erased sable.

343. HALLOWELL. _Robert Hallowell._

Armorial. Ribbon and Wreath. Motto-ribbon empty. This plate is not
signed, but is probably the work of Callender. Comptroller of the
Customs in Boston. A Loyalist whose home was mobbed. One of his sisters
married Samuel Vaughn, whose plate impales the Hallowell arms.

344. HAMERSLEY. _J. W. Hamersley._

Plain armorial. Motto, _Honore et amore_. Signed, _Faithorne_. A New
York lawyer.

345. HAMILTON. _William Hamilton._

autograph of the owner, with the date, Aug. 28, 1768, and the residence

347. HARRIS. _Alexander Harris, Architect, Boston._

An engraved label.

348. HARISON. _Richard Harison. Esqr._

Armorial. Chippendale. Motto, _Nec te quaesiveris extra_. A large plate,
very pretty in appearance, but strange in the tincture of the arms. Of
New York.

349. HARRISON. _Rich’d. Harrison._

Crest only. Motto, _Nec te quaesiveris extra_. A lambrequin looped up
with cord and fasteners above. Signed, _Rollinson Sculpt._ Presumably
belonging to the same owner as the last.

350. HARTFORD. _Hartford Library Company._

An engraved name-label; the name within an oval frame, with a festoon of
roses about it, and sprays of palm crossed beneath. Now the Hartford
Public Library.

351. HARVARD. _Sigill: Coll: Harvard: Cantab: Nov: Angl: 1650._

Armorial. Signed, _N. Hurd Sculp._ Motto, _Christo et ecclesia_. The
design is in the form of a seal, and is enclosed within branches of
holly. Above all a ribbon bears the words, _Detur digniori_, showing the
use and purpose of the plate to have been for insertion in books
presented as prizes to the students. This is the earliest of the Harvard
plates.

352. HARVARD. _Sigill: Coll: Harvard: Cantab: Nov: Angl: 1650._

Armorial. The arms of the college enclosed within a double circle which
bears the inscription. The motto, _Christo et ecclesia_, is just inside
the border. The framework is embellished with a profusion of fruit and
flowers; in the place of the crest, a pile of three books with the sun
in splendor above them;

[Illustration: Richard Harison Esq^{r}.]

on each side of the books two slender vases standing upon an upward curl
of the ornamentation hold bouquets; below this whole design a gorgeous
curtain is spread out to contain the name of the giver of the book; this
is backed by a frame whose edge only is seen; this is elaborately
scrolled, and is finished at the bottom with the canephoros head and
shell pattern; two globes at the uppermost part, on either side,
complete the decoration. Signed, _N. Hurd Boston_. Several plates are
known very similar to this, but having different names upon the curtain.
One of them has simply the words _Ex Dono_, with the curtain left blank
for the writing of the giver’s name. Others have the name of donors of
quantities of books engraved upon the curtain; among these are,
_Hancock_ and _Thorndike_.

353. HARVARD. _Sigill: Coll: Harvard: Cantab: Nov: Angl:
1650._

A very close copy of the above in all particulars;
indeed, a fac-simile of it. Signed, _A. Bowen_. On
some of them appear the name of _Shapleigh_, and
on others, _Ex Dono Samuelis A. Eliot_.

354. HARVARD. _Sigill: Coll: Harvard: Cantab: Nov: Angl:
1650._

This is again a copy in the main of the plate by
Hurd, but is later than the last. The ornamentation
is similar to that used by Hurd, but is changed
in some particulars; the canephoros head is replaced
by a bunch of grapes, the sun is missing
above the pile of books, and all the work has lost
in beauty of execution. Signed, _Andrew Filner_.
This plate is used to record the gifts of many
persons, among them being:--

  _Samuel Shapleigh._    (_Class of 1789._)
  _Joshua Green. M.D._    (_Class of 1818._)
  _Samuel Abbott Green. M.D._    (_Class of 1851._)
  _Jonathan Brown Bright._    (_1884._)

355. HARVARD. _Academiae Harvardianae Sigillum. 1638._

The arms of the college as usual, with the addition of the word
_Veritas_ upon the open books. This plate in its general design was
suggested by the plate of Hurd, but is quite different in details. The
curtain, simpler in make, is still here, and the shield is in the usual
position, but the fruit and flowers are replaced by an august assemblage
of the gods and goddesses who are the special patrons of learning.
Signed, _H. Billings del. C. G. Smith Sc._

356. HARVARD COLLEGE. _Hasty Pudding Library._

Pictorial. Two Doric pillars uphold a large curtain which is looped at
the top, and left plain in the centre for the writing in of donors’
names. Above this a circular frame encloses a picture of an iron pot,
supposedly full of pudding, towards which two hands, one with a bowl in
its clasp, and one holding a spoon, approach. The motto, _Seges votis
respondet_, is given upon the frame. Directly under this is the date,
_1808_. Below the curtain a figure of the Sphynx is seen surrounded by
books in curved shelves. The bases of the pillars bear the words,
_Concordia discors_. Signed, _Callender Sc._ A Harvard College Society
plate.

357. HARVARD COLLEGE. _Porcellian Library._

A large and handsome curtain looped up with cord in large bow-knots is
left as usual for the donors’ names; above it two small pillars with the
Greek letters on their bases, Ὁμ Ἑλ; the pillars are joined by a chain
which passes behind an oval medallion on which the clasped hands are
shown; above this the circular frame bearing the name encloses the hog;
the frame is ornamented with sprays of palm and roses, and a pile of
three books, as so often in plates of Harvard College, form the crest.
This plate is not signed, but it strongly resembles the work of
Callender.

358. HARVARD COLLEGE. _Porcellian Club. 1803._

Allegorical. Two stone pillars support a circular frame within which the
hog is pictured. On the frame the name of the club is given; below hangs
a poor curtain for the name of the donor of books; above are the arms
surrounded by the grape-vine, and having books, a loving cup, lance, and
foil grouped about. The motto across the face of the shield on a bend,
_Fide et Amicitia_. Greek letters on the base of the pillars, Ὁμ Ἑλ.

359. HARVARD COLLEGE. _Porcellian Library._

In this plate the curtain is suspended between two very tall amphoræ
which rest upon books bearing the Greek letters Ὁμ Ἑλ upon their backs;
behind the curtain two hogs disport themselves; the circular frame is
above them and encloses the representation of a punch bowl, under which
is the motto, _Dum vivimus vivamus_. Above all, the shield of arms with
the motto on a bend, _Fide et Amicitia_, is graced by grape-vine
branches, and the crossed lance and sword. Signed, _F. Mitchell. Del._

360. HAWKS. _Francis L. Hawks._

collection of books to the New York Historical Society, where they are

368. HAYWARD. _George Hayward._

Armorial. Ribbon and Wreath. No motto. Flags, cannon, a trumpet, and a
lance form the background to the shield; the mantling runs down and
joins the flowering branches which are crossed beneath the shield. Below
the name which is on the motto-ribbon, hangs a small curtain, probably
for the number of the volume.

family. Mayor of New York City, 1766-1776.

379. HILL. _Marcus Samuel Hill._

Armorial. Ribbon and Wreath. Motto, _Non sibi sed patriae_.

380. HILL. _Sam’l. Hill._ Literary. Within an oval formed by branches of
palm and holly, two books with quill and ink-pot upon them. Probably the
plate of the engraver.

381. HOAR. _Richard Hoar._

Armorial. Jacobean. No motto. This plate is not signed, but it bears a
strong resemblance to the work of Hurd.

382. HOFFMAN. _Philip L. Hoffman. Esqr._

Armorial. Ribbon and Wreath. Motto, _Carpe diem_. Signed, _Maverick
Sculpt. New York_. A bit of landscape introduced below the shield, as
was often Maverick’s way; a stretch of water, trees, books, and writing
materials complete the adjuncts. The name is signed on an open scroll;
this lower part of the plate is very similar to the plate of Prosper
Wetmore by the same engraver. Of New York.

383. HOLLADAY. Armorial. Of Virginia.

384. HOLLINGSWORTH. _Levi Hollingsworth._ Armorial. Chippendale. No
motto.

without doubt the work of Hurd. Eminent physician and surgeon of
Massachusetts. Lived to a great age and performed an operation at the
age of 92.

386. HOLYOKE. (Anonymous.)

Armorial. Ribbon and Wreath. Motto, _Sacra quercus_. This plate is
presumably of the Holyoke family, as the motto is the family motto, the
arms are meant to be the Holyoke arms, and the crest is correctly an
oak-tree. The design and execution of this plate are poor.

387. HOOPER. _Swett Hooper._ Pictorial. Over a vase full of flowers, two
cupids bearing a scroll on which is the motto, _The wicked borrow &

telescope are among the decorations.

390. HOPKINSON. _Francis Hopkinson._

Armorial. Chippendale. Motto, _Semper paratus_. Signed, _H. Dawkins
Sculp._ The frame is very like that of the Bushrod Washington plate in
some respects. This type is not uncommon; the peculiar cant of the
shield, the hissing griffin perched threateningly upon the corner of the
frame, and the very form and arrangement of the flowers and spray are
duplicated in several instances. Son of Thomas Hopkinson, the Councillor
of Pennsylvania. A signer of the Declaration from New Jersey.

391. HOPKINSON. _Joseph Hopkinson._

Armorial. The same copper as the last, with the name changed. The first
name, Francis, is not well removed and shows in the printing of the
plate. Son of Francis. A distinguished lawyer. Author of “Hail
Columbia.”

392. HORANIAN SOCIETY. _Horanian Society Library._ Allegorical. The
large shield displays a picture of the Madonna; the supporters are Diana
and the Muse of History; the crest is a pile of three books with an owl
perched upon them. A large pediment supports the shield and the figures,
and on its face the name is given within an elliptical frame; festoons
and a curtain of cloth hang about it, and the motto, _Mutual
Improvement_, is given upon a ribbon which is draped across the top of
the frame. Signed, _P. R. Maverick Sct. No. 3 Crown Street. N.Y._

encloses several spaces which are occupied by decorative features. Above

attended by the owl. Beneath her the motto appears on a curved portion
of the frame, _Inter folia fructus_. Beneath this again is the name
within an oval formed by two writhing snakes; at either side of this are

_Engrd. by P. R. Maverick 65 Liberty St. N. Y._

from some other family. Arms, Az. a lion ramp. or. on a chief ar. a
stork ppr. between two mullets sa. Crest, A bird sa. on a garb fess-ways
ppr. No motto. The name occupies the ribbon. This plate is crude in
appearance, and not unlike the work of Nathaniel Hurd; it may have been
an early attempt of his for himself or some member of his family. The
copy before me has written upon it, “Isaac Hurd’s presented to Barzillai
Frost.”

motto-ribbon.

403. HYSLOP. _Robt. Hyslop._

very scraggly. No motto.

417. IZARD. _R. S. Izard._

Armorial. Pictorial. The arms are carved on what bears strong
resemblance to a gravestone; a draped female figure stands leaning upon
the stone holding a book open, on which the motto, _Hoc age_, is given.

Armorial. Ribbon and Wreath. Motto, _Bona quae honesta_.

419. JACKSON. _Jonathan Jackson._

chief a group of thirteen stars surrounded by the word _Independence_;
in base is a plough, indicative of the spirit of the owner. Motto,

prominent patriot of the Revolution; held many offices.

shield resembles a wind-filled sail; angry waves roll at the foot, and a
part of a mast and sail are seen. The ornamentation at the sides takes
the form of trees and sprays of holly, while roses appear at the sides.
Motto, _Adversis major par secundis_.

423. JARVIS. _Samuel Farmar Jarvis. D.D._

Armorial. Literary. Mottoes: _Hora é sempre_, and see _Sola salus
servire Deo_. The shield rests against a pile of books, and above the
cross and crown are seen in a blaze of glory. Son of Bishop Abraham
Jarvis.

_William_ is written in on the copy at hand. He was a merchant in New
York. His father was an eminent ship-captain.

425. JAY. _John Jay._ Plain armorial. Motto, _Deo duce perseverandum_.
Statesman.

426. JEFFRIES. _Dr. John Jeffries._ Plain armorial. No motto. It is said
that he was the surgeon who recognized the body of Warren at the battle
of Bunker Hill. This plate is not signed, but bears strong resemblance
to the work of Callender.

scroll-work, set off at the bottom by a spirited scene in which a ship
under full sail hastens from view. At the upper part of the frame two
grotesque female faces peer at each other from across the space in which
the crest is given. In the steeple of Christ Church, Boston, in which
the lanterns of Paul Revere were hung, a chime of eight bells, made by
Abel Rudhall of Gloucester, England, was placed in 1744; each bell bears
an inscription; on the sixth we read that the subscriptions for these
bells was completed by Robert Jenkins and John Gould, Church Wardens,
Anno 1744.

430. JOHNSON. (Anonymous.)

Armorial. Chippendale. Motto, _Deo regique debeo_. The shield rests upon
an elaborately carved pedestal, on which the supporters, American
Indians, stand. This is very probably the plate of Sir William Johnson,
nephew of Admiral Sir Peter Warren, and colonial agent of George II. for
the control of Indian affairs in the colony of New York (1756). Still,
the plate seems hardly old enough to have been his, and may have been
his son’s. Only one copy is known to the writer.

431. JOHNSON. _John I. Johnson._ Pictorial. A cherub coming down on the
clouds carries a curtain before him, spread out, and on this the name is
given. A brick wall frames the oval which holds the picture. Signed,
_Maverick. St._

432. JOHNSON. _Thomas Johnson._

Armorial. Chippendale; rather wild. No motto. The design is supported
upon four short columns which rest upon a large shell. Query: Is this an
early effort of Hurd’s (as it resembles his work), or is it the work and
plate of Johnson, the engraver and herald painter?

433. JOHNSON. _W. L. Johnson._

Armorial. Chippendale. Motto, _Per aspera ad astra_. Of South Carolina.

the inscription altered. President of Columbia College, 1787-1801.

436. JOHNSTON. _Johnston._

conventional book-pile style, and is the only example we have of this
peculiar arrangement of books. The volumes are piled in three tiers
about an open scroll which is suspended in the centre and which bears
the arms. On the copy before me the letter _G_ is written before the
name. Of Maryland.

437. JOHNSTON. _John Johnston._

mantling. On the shield the inscription is given. The only copy known
(Loganian Library) is dated 1727 in ms. Governor of Pennsylvania,

Autobiography.”

450. KEMBLE. _Peter Kemble._

Armorial. Ribbon and Wreath. Motto, _Recte et suaviter_. Signed,
_Maverick Sculpt._

457. KING. _Sally King, Owner._ Pictorial. A peculiar plate, drawn in
ink, by hand. Two columns support an entablature, in the centre of which
a large representation of a mariner’s compass is given. The motto,
_Cherish Virtue_, is on the circular frame enclosing it. The work on all
parts of the design is very fine, and shows a master hand. Not many of
these plates are known, but a few are certainly known to have been in
use. They were, presumably, the work of some member of the family who
was efficient with the pen, and had time and inclination to use his
talent thus. Although dating probably about 1800, the ink is fresh, and
the plate clear and excellently drawn.

458. KINGSTON. _Kingston._ Plain armorial. No motto. Of Pennsylvania.

459. KINGSTON, CANADA. _Santa Johanis Evangelistae Sigilum Collegi

having his crook, is seated. By his side a very docile, even weakly
appearing lamb, listens while he plays the flageolet. A prominent lawyer
in New York in the middle of the last century.

were engraved in 1754; the crest, an American Indian, had not then been
decided upon.

549. MANN. _John Preston Mann._ Literary. A peculiar out-of-door scene,
in which the foreground is occupied with a very tall case of shelves
filled with books; the corner post of the case is made of a pile of
books carefully arranged; in the distance is seen the temple of Honor,
upon the summit of a hill, the ascent to which is rocky and steep; the
American eagle rests upon a globe which is placed upon the tall pile of
books; the whole design is enclosed within an oval border, which is
decorated with scrolls, etc. The last name only is engraved upon the
plate, the first ones being written in.

550. MANN. _The property of Timothy Mann. Walpole. Oct.--1810._ The name
is printed from type within a woodcut border; festoons and sprays of
palm compose the frame, in the centre of which, above, is a small circle
with the arms of the United States within it; two ink-pots with quills
in them are on either side of the arms.

551. MANNING. Armorial. Of Virginia.

Massachusettensis._

The shield of the State, surrounded by the motto of the State, _Ense
petit placidam sub libertate quietem_, is placed within the circular
frame which bears the name. Above, a pile of three books, similar to
those on the Harvard plate by Hurd, and a globe upon them stand in lieu
of a crest; a blaze of glory flashes out from these symbols of learning.

562. MASSACHUSETTS. _This Book is the Property of the Historical
Society, Established in Boston. 1790._

A printed label with ornamental type border.

563. MASSACHUSETTS. _Property of the Massachusetts Medical Society,
incorporated November 1781._

A large curtain, similar to that in the Harvard College plate by Hurd,
is upheld by festoons; this is left blank for the recording of donors’
names. Above this an oval medallion presents a picture of the efficacy
of Nature’s cures; a wounded stag with the arrow still in his side has
come to Æsculapius for healing. He, in rough garb, with the serpent
entwined around his rod, has directed the distressed animal to an herb,
which he is lying down to eat. A motto, _Natura duces_, is seen over the
picture. Signed, _Callender Sc._

564. MASSACHUSETTS. _The First State Normal School._

The arms of the State of Massachusetts surrounded by an oval garter, on

any. Motto, _Riviresco_. Signed, _Maverick, Sculpt._

571. MERCER. _Hugh Mercer._

Armorial. Of Virginia. A gallant General of the Revolution; was killed
at the battle of Princeton, at which the daring plan of crossing the

following lines:--

    _Hujus si capias dominum_
    _Cognoscere libri, si infra,_
    _Inspicida nomen habebis ibi._

At the left shelves of books are seen, and at the right what seems to be
a heavy press. Above, on a bracket, are grouped several implements of
music, art, etc. This is a rude woodcut.

584. MOAT. _Horatio Shepheard Moat._

Armorial. Ribbon and Wreath. Motto, _Nil desperandum_. Signed,
_Rollinson_.

585. MOORE. _Lambert Moore. Esqr._

Armorial. Chippendale. Motto, _Virtus interrita pergit_. This plate is
not signed, but is unmistakably the work of Dawkins. The half-draped
female on the left side is the same as that on the Whitehead Hicks
plate, and the music-making shepherd on the right is reversed from the
Benjamin Kissam plate.

586. MOORE. _Nathl. F. Moore._

Armorial. Ribbon and Wreath. No motto. Signed, _P. Maverick_. Of New
York. President of Columbia College, 1842-1849.

589. MORGAN. _John Morgan. M.D. Philadelphia._

Armorial. Chippendale. Motto, _Fama praestante praestantior virtus_.
This plate is not signed, but is very much in the style of Dawkins’
work. A cupid sits on a flourish of the decoration and pats a large bust
on its crown, presumably representing sculpture. At the other side two
cupids discuss astronomical problems with a globe for reference. One of
these little fellows is an African evidently. Eminent physician educated
abroad. One of the founders of the American Philosophical Society, 1769.

590. MORONG. _Thomas Morong._

Literary. A pile of books, some open, some closed, lies at the foot of a
cross, above which the crown is seen in glory. A ribbon runs over the
face of one book, bearing the motto, _Sola salus servire Deo_. A line of
Hebrew is given across the open book.

591. MORRIS. _Gouverneur Morris._

Armorial. Chippendale. Motto, _Tandem vincitur_. One fold of the ribbon
empty, as if possibly made for a larger motto; a stock pattern. This is
the same copper as the Lewis Morris mentioned below, with the first name
changed. Statesman and orator. Illustrated in “Art Amateur,” February,
1894.

592. MORRIS. _J. M._

Crest only. (Morris of Philadelphia.)

593. MORRIS. _James Morris._

Armorial. Chippendale. No motto. A very handsome plate, rich in
appearance, and full of decorative features. Open books, globe, and
scrolls at the base indicate a literary taste. The sides of the frame
are embellished with the caduceus and a cornucopia of fruit. Of New
York.

594. MORRIS. _Lewis Morris Esqr._

Armorial. Chippendale. Motto, _Tandem vincitur_. Father of Gouverneur
Morris.

595. MORRIS. _Roger Morris._

Armorial. Early Chippendale. No motto. The mantling is present, very
straight and stiff; the shell-work is prominent, and the whole design is
rather formal than graceful. Illustrated in “Curio,” page 112.

596. MORRIS. _William Morris._

An engraved label, the name being within an oval frame of laurel leaves.
Signed, _Shallus Sculpt._

597. MORRISON. _John Morrison. Portland. U. S. America._

sprays which are crossed beneath the shield are connected above by a row
of thirteen stars.

598. MURRAY. _James Murray._

Armorial. Chippendale. Motto, _Mens sibi conscia recti_. Of Virginia.

599. MURRAY. _John Murray._

Armorial. Ribbon and Wreath. No motto.

600. MURRAY. _The Revd. John Murray._

Armorial in form, but no true arms shown. The motto, _Malo mori quam
foedari_, is on a circular band which encloses a space, divided into
quarters, colored heraldically and charged with absurd charges; in the
first quarter, which is tinctured az., a shield with a helmet above is
supported by a row of fence posts with cinquefoils between them; the
second, which is tinctured ar., is divided per saltire, and is charged
with a powder-horn, a crescent and stars, an ox-bow, and a crown; the
third, which is tinctured gu., has Gabriel and Apollyon in combat, with
a crown above them; the fourth, which is tinctured az., has the dove
with the olive branch on a peculiar cross which holds thirteen spots
(for lack of a better term); disposed about are three flaming hearts.
This whole design is enclosed in a large shield; the crest is a man on a
prancing steed, carrying a tomahawk; the supporters are a nude Indian
with a wreath about his loins, his feet chained, and the end of the
chain and a shield in his hands; and a crowned lion with three stars on
its body. Motto, under all, _Juncta virtute fides_. This plate is not
signed. What a pity! Very probably the plate of the Father of American
Universalism, who it is said was greeted with a shower of stones when he
first tried to preach in Boston.

601. MURRAY. _Joseph Murray._

Armorial. Chippendale. Motto, _Virtute fideque_. Not signed, but
evidently by Maverick.

602. MURRAY. _Murray Earl of Dunmore._

Armorial. Supporters, mantling, and crown. Motto, _Furth--Fortune_. John
Murray, fourth Earl. Made Governor of New York, 1770; and of Virginia,

    _To Virtue & Science attend,_

606. NEWBURYPORT. _Newburyport Athenæum._

Pictorial. A large American eagle about to rise from a pile of rocks
bears a ribbon in his beak with the name upon it.

607. NEWELL. _Timothy Newell._

Military. The name is given within a frame, behind which are seen a
various assortment of military implements,--flags, swords, guns, drums,
trumpets, etc. Signed, _I. Thomas print_. This is a woodcut, and was
printed by Isaiah Thomas, the early printer of Worcester, Mass.

608. NEWPORT, R.I. _Redwood Library. Newport. R.I._

Pictorial. A large picture of the library building. Signed, _Drawn by
James Stevens Civil Engr. Engd. by W. D. Terry Newport_. The library
used other smaller plates, a simple label, and also another view of the
building with the rules governing the use of volumes printed with it.

609. NEWTON. _Lucretia E. Newton._

Armorial. Ribbon and Wreath. Motto, _Cognosce occasionem_. This is the
plate of John C. Williams, by Hurd, with the name and signature erased,
and the present name printed from type under the shield. An
unwarrantable proceeding.

610. NEW YORK. _Apprentices’ Library._

A pictorial plate of great beauty. In the immediate foreground an aged
man, clad in classic garb, accosts two youths who have evidently but
just risen, at his approach, from a moss-covered rock on which they had
been studying, if the scattered books are an indication: with uplifted
hand, the old man directs them to the temple of knowledge, which can be
seen in the distance crowning the summit of a lofty hill: at the foot of
the declivity the spires and houses of a village can be discerned:
between it and the place of meeting a broad expanse of water stretches:
a beehive at hand indicates activity, and the broken column behind the
preceptor is a link connecting classic history with present time. Above
the picture the muscular arm holds the hammer, and oak branches are
about it. Signed, _A. Anderson. Sc._

611. NEW YORK. _The Property of the New York College of Pharmacy._

An oblong name-label, with flourishes. Above, a crucible is placed,
with the rays of the sun spreading out behind it. Signed, _Rollinson Sc.
New York_.

612. NEW YORK. _The Property of the College of Physicians and Surgeons
of the University of the State of New York._

An oblong printed label with type border. This college was established
in 1807, and is now a part of Columbia College.

613. NEW YORK. _New York Society Library._

This plate is armorial in form, but presents no real arms. The central
frame, of Chippendale design, contains four quarterings, which represent
the arts of Astronomy, Navigation, Geography, Mathematics, and
Literature; Religion also is represented. Mercury and Minerva support
the frame, standing upon the ribbon which bears the name; above the
frame sits Apollo with his broad back to the full-shining sun; clouds
which resemble toy balloons rise about him. Beneath the frame appear the
outskirts of a city, with spires and towers visible; directly under this
is the word _Athenia_ in Greek (presumably to suggest that New York City
was the modern Athens); a closed chest with a lighted candle upon it has
these words on it, _sed in candelabro_, and an open book bears across
its face the motto, _Nosce teipsum_. Signed, _E. Gallaudet. Sc._
Illustrated in “Ex Libris Journal,” Vol. III, page 141.

614. NEW YORK. _New York Society Library._

Pictorial. The interior of the library is shown; Minerva, helmeted, and
with spear resting against her arm, leans upon a pillar; before her, in
obeisance, an American Indian, half draped, with tomahawk under his
foot, receives from the hand of the gracious goddess a book. The
well-filled shelves of the library are disclosed behind them, as the
drawn curtain, upheld by cords, lets the sunlight stream in. This view
is contained within an oval frame which rests upon a pedestal bearing on
its face the name of the library; the whole is filled out to the edges
of the plate by a background representing a brick wall. Signed, _Engd.
by P. R. Maverick 65 Liberty Street_. A large painting of this design
hangs in the library at present.

615. NEW YORK. _New York Society Library._

Allegorical. Minerva, just alighted from the clouds, with garments
somewhat displaced by her flight through the air, and with clouds still
about her, finds an Indian waiting to receive the volume she holds out
to him; as he lays hold of it he seems to be offering his tomahawk in
exchange. The shelves of the library are seen behind them, and in the
gable the motto, _Emollit mores_, is painted. The oval frame enclosing
this scene is upheld by ribbon and festoons, branches of oak are crossed
beneath, and the plate is signed, _Maverick. Sct. Crown Street_.

616. NEW YORK. _New York Typographical Society._

Allegorical. A picture of Franklin’s press with the American flag and a
liberty pole crossed before it; above, a large eagle with a medallion of
Franklin depending from his beak. Not signed, but attributed to
Anderson.

617. NORRIS. _George W. Norris._

Armorial. Chippendale. The same copper as the Isaac Norris, with the
name changed. Signed, _W. G. M._

618. NORRIS. _Isaac Norris._

Armorial. Chippendale. No motto. Signed, _Jas. Turner Sc._ Of
Philadelphia. Prominent statesman. He directed the placing of the
prophetic inscription upon the old Liberty Bell. His library went to the
Dickinson College. Illustrated in “Art Amateur,” February, 1894.

619. NORTH CAROLINA. _This book is the gift of ... to the University of
North Carolina. Anno Dom._

These words appear within a frame of Chippendale ornamentation. Several
books disposed about give a literary flavor to what is otherwise a
rather meaningless design.

620. OGDEN. _Lewis Morris Ogden._

Armorial. Ribbon and Wreath. Motto, _Et si ostendo non jacta_. Signed,
_P. Maverick Sc 1801_.

621. OGDEN. (Anonymous.) The Ogden arms.

plate known to me is in the Mauran-Deats collection, and was taken by
Mr. Mauran from a folio ledger of 1764.

English Engravers.”

Early English. Full mantling envelopes the shield. Motto-ribbon empty.
Of Virginia.

Thomas Paine, is said to be known. Copied from a tail-piece in the
“Gentleman’s Magazine.”

636. PANTON. _Frans. Panton._

Armorial. Chippendale. Motto, _Meliora spero_. Of New York. A
hair-dresser. Had no right to the arms. Not signed, but undoubtedly by
Maverick.

637. PANTON. _Francis Panton Junr._

Landscape. A very peculiar design. The shield is borne by two ducks, who
have each an end of a ribbon in their bills, the shield being upheld by
it over a stream; mountains in the background, each having one tree on
its peak; ducks are swimming in the marsh, and four men in a boat seem
in no hurry to get anywhere. Motto, _Spes meliora_. Signed, _Maverick
Scp._ Of New York.

[Illustration: Francis Panton Jun^{r}.]

638. PARKE. _John Parke. Esqr. A. M._

are discussing the first railroad train, which is passing at a safe
distance; the old-fashioned engine and car are moving to the left of the
picture; behind, mountains, and lakes with shipping, and a distant
village are seen. A very elaborate border encloses the scene.

[Illustration: Samuel Parker’s, Nº. 45.]

642. PARKER. _Samuel Parker’s. No._

Pictorial. _Clio_, the Muse of history, sits upon a bank of earth on
which her name is given, under the spreading branches of a tree; a youth
on bended knee receives from her fair hand a volume; other books and a
lyre would indicate that the Muse had further gifts to distribute, or
was enjoying a stay at this place. In the dim distance rises the spire
of the school, over which wheels an arrow of wild ducks. Of Roxbury,
Mass.

654. PENN. _Edmd. Penn._

mysterious. Signed, _J. J. Plocher. Sc._

661. PENNINGTON. _T. H. Pennington._

The name is printed from type within a circular frame which is engraved.
The peculiarity of the plate is that after the abbreviation _No._ for
the number of the volume, the word _Plates_ is given. Whether this was
to be erased in volumes which were not illustrated, or the number of
illustrations was to be given in those which had them, is hard to say.

662. PENNSYLVANIA. _The Historical Society of Pennsylvania._

Armorial. The arms of William Penn impaling those of the state. Motto,
_Dum clavum teneam_.

life. Proverbs. Ch. 1. ver. 17_.

668. PHILADELPHIA. _Apprentices Library Company of Phila. Instituted
1820. Opened for girls 1842._

This plate is a little later than the former, and the scene is shifted
from the class-room to the forest: here by the running brook,
overshadowed by the pines and oaks of the forest, a scroll is found upon
a rock bearing the same quotation from Proverbs that appears upon the
preceding plate. This is a woodcut very much in the style of Anderson.

669. PHILADELPHIA. _The Carpenters Company of Philadelphia, 1724._
Armorial in form. On the shield a square is used as a chevron, and is
placed between three pairs of dividers. No tinctures. The full sun

675. PHILLIPS. This plate was used in some of the books of Phillips
Academy, at Exeter, N.H., and has a representation of the arms of the
Phillips family, with a festoon of flowers above it, and below it is
appended the following statement and exhortation:--

     The Trustees of Phillips Academy to whom is committed the
     distribution of the pious bounty of the late LT. GOV. PHILLIPS
     wishing to co-operate in the same benevolent and useful design,
     affectionately recommend this inestimable book to the serious and
     careful perusal of every person into whose hands it may fall.

     Reader, whoever thou art, the work before you is the production of
     one of the ablest and best of men, whose praise is in all the
     churches. Though dead, he is instructing thousands by his numerous
     and excellent practical (?) writings which have survived him. Among
     these, _The Saints’ Rest_ has been most highly esteemed. He wrote
     it in the near view of death, when in feeble health, and for his
     own immediate use; and he testifies that he derived “more benefit
     from it, than from all the other studies of his life.” Few books
     have ever received higher commendations, been translated into more
     languages, passed through more numerous editions, been more read,
     or more useful in the Christian church than this. No person of a
     serious mind can read it without profit.

     “_To allure our desires_, it unveils the sanctuary above, and
     discovers the glories and joys of the blessed in the Divine
     presence, by a light so strong and lively, that all the glittering
     vanities of this world vanish in the comparison, and a sincere
     believer will despise them, as one of mature age does the toys and
     baubles of children. _To excite our fears_ he removes the screen,
     and represents the tormenting passions of the damned in those
     dreadful colors, that, if duly considered, would check and control
     the unbridled licentious appetites of the most sensual.”[A]

     [A] Dr. Bates.

     Reader, the book is in your hands, read, meditate, and then judge
     for yourself. May the Lord bless the instruction for your spiritual
     benefit. So will the good design of the pious doner be answered,
     and the Agents of his bounty have their desired reward.

676. PHŒNIX SOCIETY. _Phœnix Society._

Pictorial. A large shield, heart shaped, encloses a picture of a large
plantation, evidently with a considerable settlement on the rising
ground; a stream meanders through the estate, and various kinds of crops
are under cultivation; a little summer-house is seen at the end of a
long path. A large curtain is draped over the shield, and a stag and a
lion guard it at the foot. Under all, a tablet shows a second smaller
shield quartered heraldically, and bearing a hunter’s horn, a right arm,
a quill and roll of paper, and a twig from an oak tree on the four
quarters; this is draped with a festoon of holly leaves, and a line in
Greek impossible of translation is given above it. The meaning and use
of this plate is mysterious. It came from Charleston, S.C.

678. PICKERING. _John Pickering Junr._

Signed, _Printed by Zachariah Poulson Junior_. Of Philadelphia.

690. POWEL. _Samuel Powel._

Armorial. Chippendale. Motto, _Proprium decus et petrum_. This is a
better plate in execution than those made by Dawkins, and as it is
almost identical with the John Morgan, M.D., plate, which is probably by
Dawkins, it may have been his model. He seems to have copied freely
from the designs of other engravers. This plate may have been the work
of W. Smith, who engraved the William Spry. The Ryland Randolph, which
is undoubtedly English in execution, is similar to all these and better
than them all. Of Philadelphia. Twice mayor of the city.

691. POWELL. _Hare Samuel Powell._

(Boston) from 1718 to 1758. His library is one of the best known of
colonial times; he began to collect books as early as 1703, as is shown
by the following plate: “This book belongs to the New England Library,
begun to be collected by Thomas Prince upon his entering Harvard College
July 6th, 1703,” etc. The volumes were deposited in the steeple-chamber
of the Old South Church, and suffered somewhat during the British
occupation. The remaining volumes are now in the Boston Public Library.

710. PRUYN. _Samuel Pruyn. Albany._

Pictorial. The scene is towards the close of day, by the side of the

plate. The mantling comes well down the sides of the shield, and is
blown above the helmet in very feathery form. An etching, with the name
in fac-simile of owner’s autograph: in two sizes with no great
dissimilarity, though the motto is not given on the larger one. The
Massachusetts patriot.

713. RANDOLPH. _John Randolph Esqr of the Middle Temple London._

Armorial. Late Jacobean. No motto. The name and address occupy a double
ribbon at the foot. Signed, _BATH. I. Skinner_. The copy before me is

_Rohun and Co^{m}. Louisville. Ky._

Pictorial. A good head of Shakespeare is in the centre of the design;
this copy is numbered 665, showing a fair-sized number of books.

730. RIVOIRE. _Paul Rivoire._

Armorial. No motto. The family name was spelled thus in France, but was
altered very soon upon coming to this country. It is strange that this
spelling should come up again in a book-plate unless engraved by the

Printed label. Of Wethersfield, Conn.

empty; name evidently erased. Probably the plate of the signer of the

destroyed all the copies of his plate which he could find.

746. RUSSELL. _Josh. Russell._

A simple name-label. The name, with the initials above it in a cipher
monogram, is enclosed within a rectangular frame. This is a woodcut, and

George’s Church, established A. D. 1819. Presented by.... No...._

reading from a book on a table before her. This plate is not signed, and
seems to be better work than was done on the plate of the Teachers’
Union of this same church.

753. ST. GEORGE’S CHURCH. _The property of the Teachers’ Union of St.
George’s Church. Presented by.... No...._

“Curio,” page 14.

898. VIRGINIA COUNCIL CHAMBER. (Anonymous.)

Armorial. Below the arms, which are the same as those in the preceding
plate, is a scene within the Council Chamber, evidently, as the members
are around the table, and are being addressed by one of their number.
The framework which supports this is Chippendale in construction, the
armed supporters stand upon the upper part, and the very lowest panel is
occupied by the 249th line of the first book of Homer’s “Illiad,” Του
και ἁπο γλὡσσης μἑλιτος γλυκἱων ῥἑεν αὑδἡ. Signed, _Dent--Sculpt. Bull
Alley, Lombard Street. London_. The design of the plate is attributed to

912. WASHINGTON. _Bushrod Washington._

Armorial. Chippendale. Motto, _Exitus acta probat_.
Nephew of the President, to whom Mount
Vernon descended. This plate is almost identical
with the Whitebread plate by Dawkins. The
dragon changes places with the long spray of
flowers, otherwise they are the same. It is not
known whether Dawkins did this plate or not,
but presumably he copied the other from this,
which is likely to have been an imported plate. It
is not at all an uncommon type among the English
plates.

Armorial. Ribbon and Wreath. Motto, _Pelle
timorem_.

928. WHEELER. _David B. Wheeler._

936. WILLIAMS. _Gulielmi Williams ex Insula Antigua._

Armorial. Pictorial. A beautiful granite canopy is
erected on the shore of the island; a view of the sea
is afforded, and the palmetto-trees yield a grateful
shade; at the foot of the stone-work are grouped a
globe, scrolls, telescope, compasses, books, sextant,
and drawing instruments--significant of the tastes
of the owner; the arms are carved upon the face
of the stone, and the crest is protected by a hood of
graceful design; flowers in long garlands are trailed
over the monument. Signed, _S. Ingram fecit a
Paris_. A very beautiful plate.

937. WILLIAMS. _Johannes Williams His Book. 1679._

the plate of the first minister of Deerfield, Mass.,
whose house was raided by the Indians. A printed
label.

a tree with a confusion of other things,--a harp,
lyre, horn, music-book, violin bow, sword, arrow,
bow, and Indian head-dress. An expanse of water
at the right is illumined by the rising sun. Signed,
_Harris, sc._ Of Massachusetts.

943. WILLIS. _Willis._

Armorial. Chippendale. No motto. No crest.

944. WILLIS. _Samuel Willis._

Signed, _Thos. Johnston. Sc._ This design seems
to be a copy of one of Hurd’s.

945. WILSON. _David Wilson._

Armorial. Chippendale. Exactly like the succeeding,
and probably the same copper with the
name changed.

946. WILSON. _James Wilson._

Armorial. Chippendale. No motto. Very handsome

border is added, which is unusual with him, and it
is twined with garlands of roses, and has shells in
the corners.

947. WILSON. _John Wilson, Barbadoes._

Armorial. Pictorial. The scene is in the tropics;
a cornucopia pours its riches of fruit upon the
ground, just below the oval shield, which is steadied
by a winged cherub, who gazes off into the clouds;
the background shows trees, an expanse of water,
and either icebergs or snow-capped mountains.

960. WYNKOOP. _Augustus Wynkoop._

Armorial. Supporters, bacchantes with bottles in
hands and wine-cups held aloft, with scant covering
to their bodies. On the shield, beside a cask, an
old man holds a glass before a young boy, evidently
in warning; a grape-vine grows near by. An eagle
for crest spreads his wings over the mantling. The
supporters stand upon the name-frame. Of New
York.

961. WYNKOOP. _C. C. Wynkoop._

Same arms as the above. Of New York.

962. WYNKOOP. _Peter Wynkoop._

name is given in the centre of the design, with this
verse below,

_Friendship and Science thus combine
To aid and honour our design:
With us unite an equal claim,
And share alike the social name._

Above, on a ribbon bearing the motto, _E parvis oriunter magna_, two
grinning females mutually support a circular frame, in which the crowd
of Brothers is seen walking bareheaded under a powerful sun. _Omnes in
uno concordia_ is on the frame. The supporters doubtless depict
Friendship and Science. A pile of books between them completes the
inventory. Signed, _Wm. Taylor Deln. A. Doolittle Sculpt._

965. YALE COLLEGE. _Brothers in Unity._

Allegorical. Under the name the following lines are given:--

    _Hermes eloquio potens recludit
    Fontes, ecce, suos: et ampliora
    Vena Pierii fluunt liquores:
    Atque arces reserat suas Minerva._

Above is a delightful engraving. Minerva helmeted and robed but without
the spear, attended by Hermes, calls the attention of the approaching
group of young men to the pile of books on the ground before them, and
also to Demosthenes, who on the near-by sea-shore is declaiming
vociferously to the rolling waves. Signed, _E. Tisdale Del. S. S.
Jocelyn Sc._

966. YALE COLLEGE. _Brothers in Unity._

Allegorical. Beneath the name, which supports itself in mid-air, Minerva
(?) is seated, and is directing the efforts of two cherubs who are at
work on geographical and architectural problems, as evidenced by the
globe and capital before which each bends; to them comes a third cherub,
and, alighting on the capital before one of the cherubs, holds out a
scroll on which is written ΑΛΗΘΕΙΑ. The goddess calls the attention of
the other cherub to this message. Architectural features abound in the
distance. Signed, _O. Pelton. Sc._

967. YALE COLLEGE. _This book belongs to the Linonian Meeting._

A view of the college chapel and one of the halls is shown within a loop
of a ribbon which runs across the top of the plate; on the ribbon,
_Concordia societatis nostra vinculum est_. Two clasped hands below the
name are enclosed by a ribbon, on which is the word, Amicitia. Rude
quirks and flourishes are introduced, and the whole appearance of the
plate is rough.

968. YALE COLLEGE. _Linonian Library, Yale College._

Allegorical. In the immediate foreground a youth, with some uncertainty
in his air, submits to be led by the hand of Minerva, who turns to cheer
him, and points to the temple of Fame crowning the summit of the hill,
up whose tortuous sides the path they are pursuing leads; Father Time,
with discouraged mien, head resting on his hand, sits upon the globe
amid the ruin of architectural fragments, grasping his faithful scythe
in the right hand; the temple of Fame is surmounted by an angel, who is
blowing mightily on the trumpet of the goddess who presides over the
shrine; the word _Immortalitas_ is inscribed across the entablature;
just over the youth and Minerva, in a cloudy swirl, three cherubs hold
aloft a sheepskin, on which is seen _LINONIA Sept. 12. 1753. Quiescit in
perfecto_. Above all this a heart-shaped shield is divided into five
parts, which hold a pelican in her piety, a book-case, a dove on the
olive branch, the phœnix rising from the fire, and a puppy dog, whose
meaning is uncertain. Scrolls about the shield bear the motto, _Amicitia
concordia soli noscimus_. A cherub’s face peers over the shield. Signed,
_Doolittle Sc. 1802_.

969. YALE COLLEGE. _Presented to the Linonian Society by...._

Allegorical. The name is on a curtain draped beneath the picture of the
advancing Minerva, who, helmeted, robed, and with spear in hand, is seen
approaching, and apparently speaking as she comes; behind her, seated by
a pile of books, an attendant maid reclines against an urn of flowers,
and with a sun-glass draws the rays of the sun into strong focus upon a
scroll which brings into plain sight the word _Yale_. Signed, _G.
Fairman_.

970. YALE COLLEGE. _Moral Library Yale College._

Library interior. The librarian is seated by the desk, on the front
panel of which the name is carved; an open book is in his right hand; a
large globe before him, and shelves of books behind him; through the
open door, which appears to be some distance off, across the tessallated
floor, a group of students, headed by a professor in flowing robes, is
seen. Over the door the name, _Moral Society_, is placed. Above all, the
motto, _Virtus et scientia ad utilitatem dirigunt_.

971. YALE COLLEGE. _Philotechnian Library._

Pictorial. The front of a Greek temple is seen with the space in front
of it filled with the emblems and implements of the arts and sciences.
The date, _1795_, is seen on a shield in the centre; probably the date
of the founding of the library. Signed, _Jos. Perkins sc N. York_.

972. YATES. _Christr. C. Yates._

Armorial. Chippendale. Motto, _Ne parcas nec spernas_. Very rough work,
and hardly worthy to be classed as Chippendale. Illustrated in “Art
Amateur,” March, 1894.

Armorial. Chippendale. Motto, _Ne parcas nec spernas_. Signed, _H. D.

plates.

977. YOUNG. _William Young._

Armorial. Ribbon and Wreath. Motto, _Labore_. This plate has very
flowing mantling, which terminates at either side in eagles’ heads; from
their beaks depend the slight festoons which place the plate in the
Ribbon and Wreath class.

978. UNIDENTIFIED. (Name defaced.) _Property of......... Bookbinder, U.
S. A._

Pictorial. An open book; on the first page, a cradle; on the second, a
coffin; behind the book, a sword, quill, and anchor. The following
mottoes are used:--

    _See some strange comfort ev’ry state attend._ POPE.

     _Ah, when the dream of life shall be passed, what will have availed
     all its agitation, if it leave not one trace of utility behind?_
     VOLNEY.

    _Crescit amor nummi.
    Stultum est in alieno foro sigitare._

A very rude woodcut.

979. UNIDENTIFIED. (Name defaced.)

Pictorial. An eagle soars aloft, bearing an oval frame with the name of
the owner upon it; the broad rays of the sun behind the eagle light up
the pine trees on the distant hill-tops. In the lower right-hand corner
the smoke rises from the chimney of a house whose roof is just visible,
shaded by a peculiar tree.

980. UNIDENTIFIED. (Name defaced.)

Pictorial. An eagle holding a small United States shield in his beak,
and a ribbon on which the United States motto is given, _E pluribus
unum_. In the oval beneath, _Use this carefully and return it

Arms, Vert three garbs ppr. Crest, a swarm of bees about a hive.
Chippendale. Motto, _Libertas et patria mea_. Signed, _H. Dawkins
Sculpt._

982. UNIDENTIFIED. Pictorial.

Within an oval frame we see the interior of a large room, which might be
a library but looks more like a school-room; seated at a desk in the
centre of the room is a man in the elaborate costume of the gentleman of
the last century; books are before him, and on the floor beside him; a
large globe is at hand; the appearance of the seated scholar is that of
a professor waiting for his class to file in. The name is given upon a
ribbon which is tied above, but it has been cut out of the specimen at
hand. Signed, _A. Godwin. Sculp._


ADDITIONS WHILE PRINTING.

A glance at the above list shows that our early engravers had no set
rule by which to record their names on plates which they engraved; they
used full names or initials as the fancy seized them, or the room on the
plate demanded. In the word chosen to denote the fact of engraving a
great diversity is seen, though by far the most used _sculpsit_ or its
abbreviations.

Hurd and Callender seem to have been the most methodical, as they used
one form a good deal. Dawkins had several styles, and Maverick had one
or two, but was pretty certain to use an abbreviation of _sculpsit_.

A LIST OF THE MOTTOES FOUND UPON THE EARLY AMERICAN BOOK-PLATES, WITH
TRANSLATIONS.


In the Introduction to his “Handbook of Mottoes,” Mr. C. N. Elvin
separates the mottoes into the following four classes:--

  I. Mottoes which have no reference to the name or the
  armorial bearings of their users.

  II. Mottoes which have a direct reference to the bearings.

  III. Mottoes which have a punning reference to the name.

  IV. Mottoes which have a reference to both name and
  bearings.

While all these classes are represented in the following list of mottoes
and quotations taken from the early American Book-plates, such a
classification is hardly adapted to the very limited number of mottoes
employed, and we should divide them into but two general classes, under
which, however, a number of subdivisions will occur to the reader.

1. The family mottoes: used either as a matter of course or with a
reasonable pride in the possession.

2. The mottoes which are the choice or selection of the owner of the
plate: in this are included quotations from the classic writers of both
poetry and prose, mottoes of a patriotic nature, of a moral and of an
educational character, as well as others in lighter vein.

Plates are found, too, that have the family motto and one of private
suitability in addition. The expressions against the lending of books
and the lines directing the attention to the value of good reading, and
kindred sentiments, mentioned in previous chapters, are not included
here.

The translations will be found rather “free” in many cases, and it will
need but a casual glance at the construction of some of the Latin
phrases to see that such a freedom is necessary.

A FEW RECENT EXAMPLES.


[Illustration: A]ll book-plates which do not have the flavor of age
about them, and which were made quite within the memory of the
collector, are classed as recent plates. This is a term of doubtful
application; but in a general way it has come to mean all plates made
since about 1830. Their number is legion, of course, and no attempt is
here made to enumerate them, or even a small part of them, but only to
note briefly those of the more recent additions which are especially
noteworthy. And now we part with the old styles of plates. The early
armorial, with the profuse denticulated mantling, is never used, the
pure Jacobean is not seen, the graceful Chippendale has been discarded,
and the Ribbon and Wreath, with its fanciful festoons and garlands of
roses, is also a thing of the past.

This is of course natural, as the armorial plates, which are the only
ones demanding any of these styles of decoration, are very little used
now. But we have still the Library Interior, the Literary, the
Pictorial, and the Allegorical; but these have changed their appearance
so much

[Illustration: George H. Ellwanger]

as to be hardly recognizable as the lineal descendants of those of the
same type which went before. Indeed, the recent plates have little in
common with the old,--new motives, new designs, new methods, and new
conceptions of what a book-plate can be have come in, and the change
produced is very marked.

Heraldic plates are still in use, and still being made, but the number
of plain armorials is quite small. Usually, now, those who wish to show
the family arms on the book-plate do not display it all by itself, but
accompanied by literary accessories, or pictorial, or with decorative
features to relieve what would to-day appear a bare and unfinished
plate, but which in the older days would have been the pink of
perfection.

Among the plain armorial plates of recent days may be mentioned that of
_Henry B. Anthony_, the late senator from Rhode Island, which, without
even a motto, presents the arms of the family, with the crest, and the
name. Another plain armorial plate is that of _John H. Buck_, of the
Gorham Manufacturing Company, and the author of “Old Plate.” This, too,
is perfectly plain, with no motto. _Frank House Baer_ and _Charles W.
Burrows_, of Cleveland, both use the plain armorial style, relieved by
slight mantling or scroll work, and with the mottoes on ribbons beneath
the shield. _Mr. Appleton Morgan_ has a plain armorial plate, quartering
the Morgan and Appleton arms. _Mr. Daniel Ravenel_, of Charleston, also
uses a plain armorial shield, relieved with sprays of marigold (the
Huguenot emblem) and of wall-flower (the French name for which is
_Ravenelle_). A plain armorial plate, in colors, is used by the compiler
of “America Heraldica.” An imposing helmet with blue mantling surmounts
the shield, and the motto, _Moins faire mieux faire_, is given on a
ribbon which encloses the whole design. _Harry Allen Castle_, of
Hartford, uses a design borrowed from the plate of Mr. Thomas Bailey
Aldrich. The castle on its wreath is enclosed by a square frame in which
the name appears, with the words _His Mark_. In the corners of this
frame are the letters _I.H.S.V._, standing for the motto, _In hoc signo
vinces_. A punning friend, upon seeing this plate, remarked to Mr.
Castle, that the letters would seem to mean, “I have some volumes.” _Dr.
J. S. H. Fogg_, the late well-known collector of, and authority on,
autographs, used a plain armorial plate, with the motto, _Aut pax aut
bellum._ _Prof. J. Max Hark_, of the Moravian Seminary at Bethlehem,
Pa., has a plain heraldic plate, with thin mantling about the shield.
The motto occupies two lines above and below the shield, and is in
imitation of the ancient manner. _What mon a^{n} Honest^{e} Name^{n}
doth ow^{en}, To^{o} hy^{m} ry^{cht} gla^{ed}^{lie} my^{n} Bo^{ok}^{es}
i lo^{an}. But so to^{o} long^{en} y^{e} Bo^{ok}^{es} be kep^{it}, He
shal forso^{oth} be a Knav^{e} yclep^{it}._ This is printed with red
capitals, on very fine parchment paper with rough edges, and is a very
pretty plate. _Dr. Joseph Henry Dubbs_, professor in Franklin and
Marshall College, uses a plate which exhibits the arms on a shield which
is fastened to a spreading oak-tree.

[Illustration: Thomas Bailey Aldrich

His Mark]

[Illustration: MELVIN H. HAPGOOD.

HARTFORD, CONN., U.S.A.]

At either side, scrolls are drawn, which bear the motto, _Ex recto
decus_, and the following dates, which refer to the migrations of the
doctor’s ancestors: _Styria, 1446_; _Helvetia, 1531_; _America, 1732_. A
plate of unique history is that of _The Rawle Law Offices, Established
A.D. 1783, Philadelphia_. This inscription is given on a circular band
which encloses the shield of arms, and the motto, _Morte, Virtute_.
Below this, the name of the successive proprietors of the law-offices
are given, as follows: _William Rawle, 1783-1836_, _William Rawle,
1810-1858_, _William Henry Rawle, 1844-1889_, _William Brooke Rawle,
1867_. _Melvin H. Hapgood_, of Hartford, uses an oblong plate, which
exhibits the shield of arms at the left of the name space, and which is
surrounded by a fine running vine which bears both fruit and flowers,
and among the twistings of which the motto, _Inter folia fructus_, is
woven. The implements of the architect, and the secondary motto, _Penna
ferro potentior_, are also cleverly worked into the decorative frame.
_Monsignor Seton, D.D._, of Jersey City Heights, uses a

[Illustration: JOSEPH HENRY DUBBS D D]

small heraldic plate, in which the arms are given in colors, and are
surmounted by the clerical hat and tassels. A plain armorial plate is
used by _John F. Winslow_, a descendant of Governor Winslow, and one to
whose means and energy we owe the building of the first “Monitor.” Prof.
_Charles Eliot Norton_, of Harvard, uses an heraldic plate, in which the
crest only is given. Beneath this, a pile of books is covered by a
scroll, which bears upon it the motto, _Amici et amicis_. The _Rev.
Morgan Dix_, of Trinity Church, New York City, uses an heraldic plate,
in which also the crest only is given. This is surrounded by a circular
garter, on which the motto, _Quod dixi factum est_, is printed. This
ends our list of plain armorial plates.

Whatever sarcasm and disgust may be stirred up by the assumption of arms
by persons not entitled to them, no word can be said against the display
of authenticated arms upon the book-plate. Many coats-of-arms run back
for several centuries, and an honored ancestry has borne them. A
rightful pride in such memorials of past family history induces many who
are entitled to them to use their arms thus; and while the plain
armorial plate has had its day, and has passed the stage of wide
popularity, it is still in use.

Coming, now, to the Library Interior style of book-plates, we mention
first the finest example of recent work in this style,--the plate of
_Richard C. Lichtenstein_, of Boston. Mr. Lichtenstein is one of the old
collectors of plates, a member of the Council of the Ex Libris Society
of London, and a recognized authority upon American plates. As we would
expect, he has indicated his hobby in all details of his design. The
scene is laid in the corner of the owner’s den, in which are well-filled
shelves, framed prints, photographs, and the usual accessories. In the
immediate foreground, a Cupid is seated at a desk, and in his
outstretched hand holds a plate upon the globe which stands at hand,
while he reads, from an open book, the description, presumably, of the
treasure lately acquired. Two other Cupids are at his back: one bearing
the _Journal_ of the _Ex Libris Society_, and the other returning from a
successful quest for plates, if we may judge by the packet under his
arm. The presence of the globe indicates the cosmopolitan character of
the collection the Cupids are examining and adding to. A finely foliated
border surrounds the interior picture; and in a space at the right side
is a package of mounted plates; and on the left, a tied-up bunch of
book-covers, in which Mr. Lichtenstein keeps his plates. The name
appears in white letters upon a black scroll at the bottom, and behind
it is seen a castle of white stone,--a play on the name of the owner.
The plate is dated 1893, and is signed by the engraver, George Moore,
and the designer, L. Y. Van Tiffele.

The plate of _James Phinney Baxter_ reveals a most pleasing interior,
which is probably from the actual room. A tall clock is flanked by long

foreground, and _bric-à-brac_ is disposed upon convenient shelving. At
the left of the picture, a portrait of the owner is given, with a
fac-simile of his autograph. The following motto, _Who learns and learns
but does not what he knows, Is one who plows and plows but never sows_,
is also given in fac-simile of handwriting.

The plate of _William Vanamee_ shows what is also an actual interior,
probably. The stairs enter the room at the left, and the space under
them is occupied by books. Pictures adorn the walls, and a cosey bench
before the shelves invites the visitor to recline and read. The motto,
_Carpe diem_, is given above the picture, and the name below, both in
fac-simile of handwriting.

Actual comfort and enjoyment are expressed in the plate of _Louis J.
Haber_, of New York City. In this interior, a fire is blazing on the
andirons; the drowsy dog lies asleep before it; the hanging lamp sheds a
brilliant light over the room, and furnishes the means of reading which
the owner is enjoying, as he sits in an easy chair, in lounging-coat and
slippers. The rows of books at the far end of the room add to the effect
of comfort, and the motto which envelopes the whole design--_My silent
but faithful friends are they_--discloses the attitude of the owner
towards his volumes.

The plate of _Albert C. Bates_, of the Connecticut Historical Society,
at Hartford, is a reproduction of an early woodcut which represents the
interior of an old library (University of Leyden, 1614), with long rows
of books chained to their desks. Globes are protected by brass covers,
the patrons salute each other in apparent silence, and over all there is
an air of repression and elevated learning. No seats are provided, and
light is admitted through long windows filled with small lozenge-shaped
panes of glass.

[Illustration]

The beautiful colored plate of _Gerald E. Hart_, of Montreal, represents
the interior of a cell in some mediæval monastery; for the tonsured monk
is sitting upon his stone bench, illuminating a large volume. The Gothic
window admits light through its highly colored design, and rows of
vellum lie beside the desk of the old monk.

The plate of _W. E. Baillie_, of Bridgeport, Conn., represents a corner
of a modern library, furnished in the Louis XV. style, having some
half-dozen frolicsome Cupids, rolling on the rugs, peeking out of the
window, reading in arm-chairs, or discussing the volumes taken from the
elaborately carved case. This plate is the second one to make use of
the half-tone process direct from the pencil sketch.

Continuing with the plates which come properly under the classification
“Literary,” we find them to be very numerous, very various in design,
and very unlike in shape and treatment. A plate which represents the
past is used by _Henry M. Brooks_, of Salem, Mass. In this the old
ink-pot and quill, the box of wafers, the wax and seal, and the sand for
blotting are disposed about the letter, which, being used before the
days of postage stamps and envelopes, bears the amount due and the
address upon the back of the sheet. The address seen is that of the
owner.

Going still further back in history _E. Irenæus Stevenson_ has brought
the very serpent of the Garden of Eden, with the fatal apple of
Knowledge in his fangs, into his book-plate. Slipping down between the
open pages of a large book, we see this form of his Satanic Majesty, and
read upon the apple which he offers _Eritis sicut Deus_, _Ye shall be as
gods_. This, from the Vulgate, is in Latin. Upon the open page we read
in Greek, _Be ye wise as serpents_. The Shekinah blazes out all about
the book. A very interesting and striking plate.

A very simple but effective reminder of the approach of old age is found
in the plate of _George Alexander Macbeth_, of Pittsburgh, Pa. In this,
an open book of coarse print lies upon the table, accompanied by a large
pair of spectacles. The motto appears in the upper left corner,--_Give
me your favor: my dull brain was wrought with things forgotten_.

Very many plates have a shelf of books, or a pile of them, accompanied
with a favorite quotation, a bust of some author, the arms of the owner,
or possibly his portrait. In the plate of _Clifford Julius King_, we see
the row of books, the smoke from the waning cigar, as it rises across
the open pages of a book, and the bust of Thackeray, while the motto, _A
jollie goode booke, whereon to looke, is better to me than golde_, is
suggestive of long evenings by the fireside, with choice editions to
read and fondle.

The shelf of books in the plate of _Nathaniel Paine_, of Worcester,
Mass., is enclosed within a frame which has suggestions of the heraldic
shield. Behind it the palm branches are placed,

[Illustration: MARSHALL CLIFFORD LEFFERTS.]

and the motto is below, on a ribbon,--_Duce natura sequor_. The crest is
found in its place above.

“Wrenwood” is the name of the home of _George E. Leighton_, if we may
judge by the name which appears on the top of the shield, which rests
against his books just inside the library window. The window is open,
flowers peek around the mullions, and a wren has hopped upon the sill to
examine the surroundings which have borrowed his name for their own.

A pile of three books, labelled _Bacon_, _Lamb_, and “_Punch_,” is shown
in the plate of _David Murray_. The legend, _Some books are to be
tasted, some to be swallowed, and some to be chewed and digested_, is
given on the back of the books. Above the volumes, the scales carrying
the heavy pen on one side, and the lighter sword on the other, is
surmounted by a liberty-cap, behind which, in a blaze of glory, appears
the motto, _The pen mightier than the sword_.

In the plate of _George Imbrie Sill_, three shelves of books are
enclosed within a frame of scrolls which bear the name. A shield is
placed across one end of the case, with the arms and crest upon it.

Now we come to a plate which takes us below the surface. A wondrous
mermaid, at the very depths, flanked by huge dolphins, is receiving a
perfect shower of books, which come tumbling down through the water.
This is the plate of _H. W. Bryant_, of Portland, Me.

_Marshall C. Lefferts_, of New York City, uses small leather labels on
which an open book bearing his monogram is stamped in gold. Different
colors of leather are provided for different volumes. This is the only
instance of the use of leather for a book-plate in this country, if I
mistake not: a very handsome material, too, for the purpose, and
meriting wider use.

[Illustration: JOHN HERBERT CORNING]

In the plate of _John Herbert Corning_, of Washington, Atlas, with
strained muscles, supports the world of letters. _Litterae_ is inscribed
upon the immense globe which rests upon his shoulders.

Two children of the forest, a boy and a girl, with flowing hair and
meagre garments, come towards us in the plate of _A. L. Hollingsworth_,
of Boston, bearing between them a panel on which is carved the motto _Un
bon livre est un bon ami_. The dense forest is close behind them, and
were it not for the reader, one feels as if no person would pass their
way to see their lofty sentiment. So thick, indeed, is the tangle of
brush, that the loss of their clothes must be laid to their passage
through it.

[Illustration: D^{r}. G^{eo}. L. Parmele, Hartford.]

In the plate of _Dr. George L. Parmelee_, of Hartford, a herald in court
costume is proclaiming, through his long trumpet, the loss of a book.
The banner hanging from the horn shows the words he uses: _Verloren!
Verloren! ein Buch_.

We are again taken far down below the waves, in the plate of _William
Ashmead Courtenay_, of Charleston, S.C. Down indeed, to the very bottom
of the ocean, where the weeds grow, and the dolphin feeds. Above, the
waves are rolling, and a far stretch of water is seen. The view is
enclosed within a square frame which bears the name.

The _Rev. Wm. R. Huntington_, rector of Grace Church, New York City,
uses a design which is adapted from a frontispiece by Walter Crane for
the “Fairy Tales” of the Brothers Grimm, and which represents a youth,
with long curls falling from under his cap, opening the door of a house,
with a huge key. Upon the roof, two cupids, in imminent danger of
sliding off, are making music with lyre and voice. A few stars shine
against the night, and the light of the moon falls across the face of
the structure, revealing the huge orange-trees in fruit, which flank the
doorway. The motto, _In veritate victoria_, is carved upon the steps,
and the name _Huntington_ is given at the very top of the design.

Other plates whose principal features are “bookish” are those of _Henry
A. Morgan_, which has simply a large book, open, with blank leaves: on
one is inscribed _The page in waiting_; of _Edward Denham_, which has an
owl perched upon an open volume, upon whose pages are the following
names, _Bede_, _Camden_, _Bradford_, _Chaucer_, _Shakspere_, _Sandys_,
with the torch of knowledge and the wreath of victory behind it: the
wreath is tied with a ribbon which bears the

[Illustration: JOHN E. RUSSELL.]

motto--_Nulla dies sine linea:_ of _Charles F. Jilson_, Chicago, on
whose plate simply a closed book is seen, with a palette resting upon
it; the brush and the drawing tools reveal the art of the owner, while
the half-covered lyre upon the book-cover may be an indication of his
hobby;--of _Alfred Trumble_, of New York City, who displays a table
whereon the bust of Minerva, the student-lamp, the scroll, ink-stand and
quill, and the books jostle each other in delightful literary
confusion;--of the _Hon. John E. Russell_, of Boston, who shows the owl
of Minerva seated upon the books of the scholar: the globe, materials
for writing, and the lamp of knowledge are disposed about, and the whole
is encircled by an oval wreath of holly.

The plate of _Thomas J. McKee_, of New York City, represents a volume of
Shakespeare’s Works, open to the title-page, which is occupied
principally by a portrait of the famous author playwright. The arms and
name appear upon the fly-leaf of the book, other books are at hand, and
the following lines are given at the foot:--

    _Tu mihi currarum requies, tu nocte rel atra_
    _Lumen, et in solis tu mihi turba locis._

The plate of _Paul Lemperly_, of Cleveland, designed by Garrett, shows
the open book, with the serpent circled about it. The stars shine
beyond, and the design is enclosed within a rectangular border of holly
leaves.

Another class of plates which claim attention to-day is that which is
representative of either the hobby or the vocation of the owner. For
special collections, for certain kinds of books, plates are designed
which express the particular line of reading, or of collecting, which
they are to ornament. This style of plate is coming more and more into
use, and earnest pleas have been put forth for its wide adoption;
notably, one by _Henri Pene Du Bois_, in the “Book Lovers’ Almanac,” for
1894. In his worthy article on the “Art of the Book-plate,” this writer
argues forcibly for the expression of a genuine idea in the book-plate.
Not mere coats-of-arms, crests, pictorial designs or devices and
ornaments which look pretty, seem to him suitable for use as
book-plates, but an emphatic representation of an idea, a worthy idea,
clad in suitable form. He argues for special plates for special
collections, for a specific plate for a specific line of books; not an
ornamental label simply, to be placed in each book in one’s library, but
a different plate, with a reason for its existence, in each different
department. Very few, if any, in this country, carry the idea so far;
but many plates are now in use which convey at once an idea of the
pursuit of the owner, whether it be in literature, art, science, or
professional life. The plate of _George Edward Sears_, with its grinning
skull, is perhaps at first glance unpleasant in its effect, but when one
comes to unravel the plain meaning of the symbolism, the shudder dies
away, and we are prepared to regard the plate as one of the very highest
types, and most successful in its way. Mr. Sears has gathered a large
collection of books relating to the “Dance of Death,” and finding in

[Illustration: Paul Lemperly]

a 1754 edition of Matthew Merian’s work, this plate which seemed no part
of the series but an impromptu addition, he adopted it for his
book-plate. Mr. W. J. Linton engraved the block, reducing considerably
from the original. This plate is used only in the books relating to the
topic it suggests. In this plate the skull is placed upon an open book,
between a lighted candle and a few flowers in a vase. A wreath encircles
the smooth pate, and an hour-glass rests upon it, with the hovering
wings of Time, and the scales, just above. The lower half of the plate
has a very dark background, while the upper is filled with light.

_Henry Blackwell_, of New York City, uses a plate in his collection of
Welshiana which was designed for the purpose. In this plate we see the
sturdy oak raised in the centre of the scene. Upon the right side, the
bearded Druid is lopping off the branches of the mistletoe, which seem
to be growing with the oak. Opposite to him, the early Briton with his
harp makes wild music. A circular medallion upon the tree represents the
peak of Snowden, the highest mountain in Wales, and the motto, _Cared
doeth yr encilion_, is given upon the frame. This plate, like that of
Mr. Sears, was suggested by an illustration in an old book. A second
plate is used for the literature upon the famous voyage of Madoc to our
shores in A.D. 1170. In this plate we see the old-fashioned, high-sided
ship, with its bellying sails, plunging through the rolling waves, as it
passes out to sea with the hardy adventurer and his crew.

[Illustration: Dean Sage.]

[Illustration: EX LIBRIS--JOSEPH H WHEELER]

As examples of plates representative of the hobby of their owners, we
have the following: _Dean Sage_; an angling plate, very simple in design
and very fine in execution, with a large trout, and the rod and the
landing net crossed behind it: an enthusiastic fisherman, and the author
of a sumptuous volume on salmon-fishing in some of the Canadian rivers,
Mr. Sage uses this plate only in the books of his library which relate
to the gentle pursuit favored of Walton;--_Howland_; An angling plate of
very handsome design: the shield of arms is surrounded with the
implements of the fisherman, with evidences of his success and with the
weeds which grow by the water side: the motto _Piscator non solum
piscator_ floats on a ribbon above;--_Lucius Poole_; the masks of Comedy
and of Tragedy are brought together in this plate, as indicative of the
books collected by Mr. Poole;--_Arthur Robinson Stone_: a folio volume
of music is open to the Largo of the second part of the “Messiah,” by
Handel, and is copied from the original score preserved in the British
Museum:--in the plate of _Martin Hayden_ two Cupids bear a shield on
which the name is given: each little Cupid also manages to hold a mask:
the motto, _Upward, Onward_.

_Fred C. Schlaick_: in this we see the uppermost part of a column and
its Corinthian capital. A little Cupid flies away from the finished
piece of work, carrying the veil which had concealed it from view. This
design hardly needs the word _Architect_, which is added just after the
name, to express the profession of the owner.

_Edward Stratton Holloway_: in this design, the owl is perched upon a
limb, with the palette, brushes, sketch-book, and pencils of the
illustrator within his clutch.

A most happy plate is that of _Mr. Richard Hoe Lawrence_, which is
designed for use only in the library housed at his country seat,
“Oscaleta Lodge,” and which is mainly botanical. In this plate the
partridge-vine, _Mitchella repens_, is shown in its proper colors, and
is surrounded by a double border of red lines, within which the motto,
from

[Illustration: FRED. C. SCHLAICH.

ARCHITECT]

Rabelais, _Fay ce que vouldras_, is given in yellow. The plate was
designed by Miss Mary S. Lawrence.

For a Philatelical library, the plate of _Mr. John K. Tiffany_ is
exceedingly appropriate, the design being enlarged from the old and rare
St. Louis Postmaster’s stamp of 1845. The book-plate was cut on wood by
the same man who designed the original stamp. It is an exact fac-simile
of the old stamp, giving the two bears holding between them the circular
frame which encloses the arms.

A very good example of the Allegorical book-plate is that of _George H.
Ellwanger_, of Rochester. This is designed to illustrate the LXX sonnet
of the Amoretti, of Spenser. With all the charming freshness of the
early vernal season about her, we see Spring, in graceful drapery,
carrying buds and blossoms in her hands, and crowned with a wreath of
flowers, approaching us. The garlands, the numerous birds, the new
leaves upon the trees, and the sense of warmth in the scene, clearly
depict the meaning of the artist.

Turning, now, to the pictorial plates, we find their number rather
small. Decorative features, bits of landscape and of interiors are found
in many plates; but these little ornamentations do not constitute a real
pictorial plate. One of the finest examples is the plate of _E. G.
Asay_, of Chicago. In this we find ourselves intruding upon the councils
of the Muses; for we see Art seated upon a throne, with the palette and
brushes idle in her lap, while about her, in graceful manner, recline
History, Music, and Literature. The lyre of Music is quiet, as, with
her hand affectionately placed upon the shoulder of History, she listens
to the reading of the just-inscribed record. Art likewise gives
interested attention to the recital; and Literature, with her book
closed, leans upon the convenient globe, and listens.

Wholly different is the plate of _Allen Wallace_. In this, one of the
Naiadæ reclines upon the

[Illustration: Arthur Robinson Stone.]

over-turned urn, from which the never-ceasing flow of water falls over
the rock, and slips away in a widening stream. With one hand she
caresses the limpid flow, as it emerges from the urn. At either side,
below her, two dolphins discharge quantities of water from their mouths
into an immense shell which receives the stream from the urn as well.
Tall sheaves of wheat rise above them, and directly behind the head of
the Naiad is the motto, _Nil clarius aquis_.

_Mr. H. E. Deats_, of Flemington, N.J., has a most beautiful specimen of
steel engraving which he uses in his numismatic library. In this, we see
a female figure clad in classic costume, with a diadem on her brow,
sitting on the clouds, and having at her side an oval shield, on which a
very important peacock is depicted as using the globe for his perch. On
either side, cornucopiæ of fruit and flowers barely hold their
quantities of produce. The motto, _Instauratio saeculi felicis_, is
placed upon the edge of the shield.

The plate of _Frances Louise_ and _Charles Dexter Allen_ represents a
female figure in classic robes seated upon a stone bench at the foot of
tall trees. It is twilight, and the glint of the weakening light is seen
through the leaves. Books, manuscript, and scrolls are strewn around the
solitary figure. The motto, _Sapientiam veram petimus_, is carved along
the top of the wall behind. One arm of the figure is thrown across the
top of an open book, on which the names of the owners are given. This
plate was suppressed at the request of the publishers of a magazine in
New York City, as it so closely resembled the design on their cover.

[Illustration: SAMUEL·WESLEY·MARVIN]

A very effective plate is that of _F. W. Hoyt_, of Albany, N.Y. In this
an Ionic column forms the whole design. Very beautifully engraved: the
lamp of Knowledge is continually burning, and continually fed on the top
of the capital, while the names of the “Immortals” are bound around the
shaft on a ribbon,--_Homer_, _Dante_, _Cervantes_, _Shakespeare_,
_Shelley_. The name of the owner is carved upon the base.

In the plate of _Samuel Wesley Marvin_, is depicted the sleeping knight,
to whom come

[Illustration:

Pleasure and Knowledge, each with her offer of satisfaction and reward.
The motto, _Courage le diable est mort_, is seen on the broad ribbon
which is laid about the picture.

[Illustration: V A]

The plate of _Adam Van Allen_, of Albany, is copied from the plate of
the brothers Goncourt, and represents the left hand with a pair of
dividers held by the third and fourth fingers, while the first and
second are placed upon a sheet of paper bearing the initials _V A_.

Several peculiar plates remain to be mentioned, which belong to no
style, but are examples of the individual taste of the owners, which is
now so marked a feature of book-plate designing. Not, as formerly, are
we controlled as to the style which we shall adopt, but each book-lover
can, without appearing eccentric, place whatever design he chooses
within his book-covers.

The plate of the well-known _litterateur_, _W. Irving Way_, of Chicago,
is simply a very small bit of paper with his initials in cipher upon it.
The plate of _Fred J. Libbie_, of Boston, one of the largest collectors
of plates, is a cryptogrammic arrangement of the letters forming his
name.

An old plate of _Richard Hoe Lawrence_ caricatures each of his three
names: the first, by the “dickey bird”; the second, by the agricultural
implement suggested by the middle name: and the third, by a picture of
the emaciated Saint Lawrence frying over a fire of flaming fagots. As he
fries, he reads from a book entitled, _Lawrence on Gridiron_.

The plate of _Marcus Benjamin_, of New York City, is a punning plate,
and represents the gentleman himself riding his hobby-horse, which is in
the form of a big folio. With a long quill for a lance, and wearing a
crucible for a hat, he rides his horse, full merrily. The plate of _J.
Hiestand Hartman_, of Lancaster, Pa., is very curious. In this, the
shield is borne by a skeleton, who stands erect, with the lance resting
in the right arm. A banner floats from the lance-head, ribbons rise in
profusion on either side, and the grinning sentinel is enclosed in the
fluttering ends. _E. A. Hitchcock_, of the United States Army, has a
plate of peculiar and hidden meaning. In this, the prominent feature is
a huge dragon, winged, scaly, with forked tail and snakelike head. With
the end of his tail in his mouth, he forms a frame of oval form, and
repulsive kind, for a picture of a little girl, who seems to be sitting
upon a honeycomb, and who holds a necklace in her left hand. The motto,
_Non nisi Parvulis_, must contain some reference to the event recorded
in the book-plate.

[Illustration: MARCUS BENJAMIN.]

The plate of _George Dudley Seymour_ has the unusual feature of a large
representation of an old door, with its carved posts, and pediment of
high-boy style. In the centre of the design, above this, at the right, a
small view is given of the whole house from which the door is taken, and
in the opposite corner a scroll bears the words: _Captain Charles
Churchill, hys house at Weathersfield in the Colony of Connecticut in
Newe England_, 1754-1885. This plate is by W. F. Hopson, of New Haven,
Conn., and is very effective. _Mr. Hopson’s_ own plate is also a very
beautiful specimen of his skill. In this, the central panel is filled
with three old folios in aged condition, tumbled together upon the
table. In the upper corners, a press for plate work and a painting on an
easel are seen. Below the central space, a closed portfolio affords
space for the record of the number of the volume. About all, are
elaborate scrolls of rustic design. Over the space, a small kettle holds
a number of fine brushes, and the motto is on a ribbon which is well
carried through the scrolled sides. The motto is an adaptation of one of
older date, and reads as follows: _Old books to read, old prints to
scan, old wood to carve, old friends to greet_.

As yet, we have but one example of the work of C. W. Sherborn, the
celebrated engraver, of London, among our American book-plates. This is
the beautiful plate of Mr. _S. P. Avery_, of New York City. This is not
heraldic, but of a decidedly personal bent, and very indicative of the
special lines of collecting to which the owner is devoted. The upper
part of the plate is filled with a conventionalized tulip design, which
is extremely rich in appearance and graceful in disposition. A ribbon
bearing the name, _Samuel Putnam Avery_, flutters in and out among the
curves of the tulip stems and leaves. Grouped at the lower edge of the
plate are a number of books, in artistic bindings, one being noticeable
as having a Grolieresque design. The titles of most of the books can be
read, and among them

[Illustration: GEORGE DUDLEY SEYMOUR.]

are De Bury, Shakespeare, Goethe, Emerson, Montaigne, Ruskin, Bewick,
and Washington Irving. Rembrandt’s “Three Trees,” also found among the
accessories at the foot, is indicative of the collector of etchings. The
graver, eye-piece, cushion, and block on which the portrait of
Washington is cut, denote the art of engraving, and the head of Minerva,
which rests proudly upon the volume of Ruskin, represents the patron of
Art. This plate is a fine example of the peculiar personal flavor which
Sherborn has infused into his revival of this particular kind of German
work. The grouping of the books at the bottom is excellent, and the
graceful sweeps of the tulip pattern, as it fills the upper two-thirds
of the plate, are very pleasing. The motto, _Far more seemly were it for
thee to have thy Study full of Bookes than thy purse full of money_
(Lilly), is placed beneath the design.

Two specimens of the work of Paul Avril, for American owners, are of
exceeding daintiness and delicacy in design and execution. The plate of
_Clarence H. Clark_ represents Venus in gauzy drapery, with a
looking-glass in her hand, reclining upon a pile of books, some of which
are closed. A fragment of the scroll of a Chippendale frame, with one or
two roses about, complete the decoration. The motto, _Amat victoria
curam_, is seen upon the open page of a folio volume. The plate is very
light and pretty.

In the plate of _George B. De Forest_, by the same artist, we are
ushered into the library of the owner. Here a cherub draws back the
curtain, and affords a view of the treasures upon the well-filled
shelves, not only to the beholder, but also to a scantily clad female
who, with one foot upon the step of the shelf-ladder, appears to halt in
an ecstasy of delight. An open book on the floor, and a portfolio
standing near the shelves, complete the accessories. The whole is
surrounded by a frame of foliated scrolls.

In the plates of _Dr. Henry C. Eno_ we have examples of the owner’s
personal skill as an etcher. In one design, a lighted candle is placed
upon a closed book, which is labelled _Ex Libris Volume_, and is
presumably filled with rare treasures among our very early American
plates. The second plate represents a lighthouse, with rolling waves at
its foot. The broad bands of light stream from the lighted lantern,
across the black night. The scene is enclosed within a circular frame.
This is set upon a background, which may represent a fish-net, and is
finally enclosed by a border of rope. A bit of rope tied in a sailor’s
knot lies under the lighthouse picture, and supports the name, _Ex
Libris H. C. Eno_.

Among collectors, there has been of recent years a strong desire to
secure specimens of the plates of the ladies. In England, where the
heraldic features of a lady’s plate are required to be in some respects
very different from those of the gentleman, they may be said to
constitute a class by themselves. But with us, while of equal interest,
they do not show any marked difference in their design from the
gentlemen’s. Indeed, most of them, if not all, would serve just as well
for one as for the other. The plate of _Charlotte Cushman_, which is
heraldic, is incorrect, if judged by the rules of the art. The arms are
not in a lozenge, the crest is given, and the motto is displayed. But
the plate has none the less a deep interest to the American collector,
who indeed can well afford to overlook any trifling irregularities which
may be pointed out by a student of a science not in vogue with us.
_Habeo pro jus fasque_ is the motto on the plate. Two other heraldic
plates are now used by American ladies. The plate of _Mrs. E. H. L.
Barker_, of Warren, R.I., is designed by Mr. J. McN. Stauffer, and is
heraldically correct, in that no crest is given, and that the frame
enclosing the arms is of the required form. However, the motto is given,
and the animal of the crest is made to do service as a supporter of the
rod on which the shield rests. The plate is small, and very neat in
appearance. The plate of _Miss Jessie Brewster_, of Shelton, Conn., is a
plain armorial, displaying the arms claimed by the descendants of Elder
William Brewster of Massachusetts. Another Rhode Island plate, and one
which is representative of the hobbies of the owner, is that of _Mrs.
Alonzo Flint_, of Providence. This is a large plate, in the centre of
which is an arrow-head of flint, in reference to the name of the owner.
In the corners are displayed books, easel and palette, violin, music and
‘cello, and two cathedral spires,--all indicative of the likings and
pursuits of the user of the plate. A wreath of ragged chrysanthemums
and ivy leaves surrounds the central design, on which a beehive is
placed, among hollyhocks. This is, as was intended, a plate whose every
part is illustrative of the interests of the owner, who was also its
designer.

[Illustration: EX LIBRIS. JULIA DEXTER COFFIN]

The plate of _Mrs. Julia Dexter Coffin_, of Windsor Locks, Conn., was
designed and is used wholly for books of music, or in her library of
musical literature. The scene is within the choir of some temple. A
flood of light enters the lofty apartment from the open door at the far
end of the wall, and the small diamond panes of the large window reveal
nothing of the outside world. Seated upon the stone bench, in the
foreground, clad in classic robes, a member of the chorus, inspired by
some longing, has come alone, to pour forth her feelings in song. The
lyre in her hands is of old and ornamental design. Behind her, upon the
wall, runs a dado on which the sacred dance is pictured; and above this
a large mural painting can be seen. In the niche by the door stands a
statue of Terpischore. The sound of the music seems to fill the room.

Purely decorative, and having no particular meaning beyond illustrating
the motto, is the plate of _Ophelia Fowler Duhme_. The motto, _Inter
folia fructas_, is given at the top of the plate, and the strawberry
plant, bearing both flower and fruit, fills the whole space below.

Two Cupids disport themselves among sweet roses, in the plate of
_Frances Louise Allen_.

In the plate of _Margaret M. Miller_, a cherub, with the hair in a
Psyche knot, sits upon a closed book, and inscribes the names of the
“Immortals” upon a scroll.

In the plate of _Miss Ada Stewart Shelton_, of Derby, Conn., the motto,
_Plus penser que dire_, is given with the name and a single pansy
blossom within a rectangular frame which has pansies at each corner.

In the plate of _Mary Bayliss_, we have a frame of Chippendale tendency.
The scrolls are edged with shell-work, and the flowers are free and
natural.

Very interesting and successful work in designing and engraving
book-plates is now being done by Mr. E. D. French, of New York City, Mr.
E. H. Garrett, of Winchester, Mass., and by Mr. W. F. Hopson, of New
Haven, Conn., all of whom are represented in this volume by prints from
the original coppers.

AMERICAN COLLECTORS AND COLLECTIONS.


[Illustration: C]ollectors of book-plates are not very numerous in the
United States; but, small as their number is, it has reached the present
figure almost at a bound, for we now count about seventy, who are
collecting, while, four years ago, there were scarcely a score.

A survey of our collections shows that all are particularly interested
to collect American plates. The early American examples are few, and
daily becoming scarcer, as the search for them grows hotter, and the
competition between prospective owners increases.

The scarcity and value of our early specimens are not appreciated fully
by our brother-collectors over the sea, nor is our national pride in
keeping them within our borders realized. Having so few, we cannot be
lavish with the rare examples we are able to find; and so it comes about
that the demand for our plates is not met as it once was. The
book-plates of our ancestors are not so easily found as are those of the
past generation in the older countries. Books were fewer here,
devastation by fire and pillage has ruined much that we lament over, and
the good old plates turn up but rarely now.

Our collections are not large as compared with the gigantic aggregations
which we hear of as being made in England. Think of one collector having
one hundred thousand specimens! The largest collection here will not
exceed six thousand, and those next nearest to that fall some two
thousand behind it. Our collections are good, representative of the best
foreign styles and dates, and do not include much that is valueless.
“Small, if need be, in numbers, but excellent in quality,” would seem to
be the maxim of those who collect over here. German plates, particularly
of the oldest engravers, French plates, and the English plates of men of
prominence, are well represented. Plain heraldic plates are not held in
high esteem, while the Pictorial, Literary, Library Interior, and
Ladies’ plates are all sought for.

Among the very first to enter the field as a collector of book-plates in
the United States was the late James Eddy Mauran, of Newport, R.I.

Mr. Mauran was a New Yorker by birth, the son of a West India merchant.
He was a painstaking collector, a close student, and a man fully
acquainted with the foreign languages, and the literature of the times
he felt an especial interest in. While deeply interested in other lines
of research and collecting, he found time to gather a good collection of
American and foreign book-plates, which were mounted with the nicety and
taste shown in all branches of his collecting.

At the time of his death, in 1888, he had about 3500 plates in all, and
they were appraised by Mr. Hewins, a friend of Mr. Mauran, at three
hundred dollars, and were sold to a Philadelphia gentleman. Mr. Mauran
had a way of mounting his plates which was original and unique. He
pasted them down on pieces of marbled paper, and other kinds of paper
used in the ornamental binding of books. He was at pains to obtain from
binders, stationers, and booksellers all the pieces of paper of this
kind that could be found, in order to have as many different mounts as
possible. These papers were all mounted on stiffer white paper, and
formed a good substantial ground for the final mounting.

His titled plates were mounted on gold and silver paper; and the ladies’
plates on bits of silk, damask, satin, or old pieces of brocade and
other things pertaining to ladies’ wear. The American plates were
mounted on the older styles of marbled papers, and on fancy patterns and
colors in use years ago. They were numbered on the back, and were kept
in alphabetical order. Very often the back of the mount was covered with
notes about the owner of the plate. Portraits, autographs, views of
houses, and sketches of the owners from newspapers, were also mounted
and placed with the plate they were identified with. The plates were
kept in old book-covers of fine, polished calf, beautifully tooled on
the back and edges. An interesting history is connected with these
covers. Mr. John Austin Stevens, of New York, had made a fine collection
of the poetry, ballads, and romances of the mediæval ages, which was
bound in the sumptuous style mentioned. Upon the occasion of a visit to
Europe, Mr. Mauran, who was a friend of Mr. Stevens, saw them carefully
packed in boxes, which were deposited in the vaults of the Chamber of
Commerce building in New York, and insured for ten thousand dollars.
During the absence of the owner, the negro janitor of the building broke
open the boxes, and, tearing out the insides of the treasured volumes,
sold them for waste paper! Portions were recovered; but the covers were
of no further use as originally intended, and they fell to Mr. Mauran,
who used them to hold his book-plates. This collection was quite rich in
the early plates of America; for Mr. Mauran, being well-nigh the first
in the field, had the cream of collecting for some time, and was able to
secure plates which now are not to be had.

Not very long ago, this collection changed hands again, as the first
purchaser, having no time to make use of the plates, was willing to sell
them to some collector who could make them of greater use among others
interested in the same topic. In some way the collection became
disrupted, and parts of it are owned by different collectors.

Mr. E. N. Hewins is one of the older collectors among us. Mr. Hewins has
a very interesting album of American plates, in which a goodly number of
the rarer specimens find a resting-place. Other albums are used for the
foreign examples, and the number of plates in the collection places it
well up towards the head of the list of large and valuable collections.
The plates are classified by styles.

Mr. Richard C. Lichtenstein, of Boston, has a large collection of
book-plates. A part of his collection is arranged alphabetically in a
large quarto bound in brown morocco, with gold tooling, and made
especially for the purpose with leaves of very thin tinted paper.
Individual mounts are also used. This collection is one of the largest
and probably the best, as regards Americana, of all in the United
States.

Another Boston collector who has been collecting for some time, and who
has a valuable collection, is Mr. Fred J. Libbie. Mr. Libbie has a copy
of _Warren_, most beautifully bound in crushed levant, which is
extra-illustrated by the insertion of rare original plates, autograph
letters, portraits, and views. The volume is extended to fully three
times its original thickness, and is an elegant specimen of the
book-binders’ art, as well as a most valuable storehouse of fine
book-plates. Other works on the subject of book-plates are in process of
extra-illustration by Mr. Libbie, who is an enthusiastic collector,
confining himself to no specialties, but making an excellent collection
in all lines.

The largest collection of plates is that belonging to Mr. H. E. Deats,
of Flemington, N.J. This industrious collector, while a rather new
comer, has distanced all the older men, and, being the owner of the bulk
of the Mauran collection, has some very fine examples, as well as large
numbers, to boast of.

Dr. Henry C. Eno, of Saugatuck, Conn., has a large and valuable
collection mounted in volumes bound in full levant.

We number among our collectors several ladies, and it is earnestly to be
hoped that here, as in England, we may have plates designed by lady
artists. Probably the earliest lady collector is Mrs. Richard J. Barker,
of Warren, R.I., who has several albums filled with good plates, and who
has contributed an interesting article on the subject of early American
plates to the literature of our topic. Other ladies who are collecting
are Miss Helen E. Brainerd, of Columbia College Library; Mrs. C. H.
Duhme, of Cincinnati; Mrs. E. M. Gallaudet, of Washington; and Miss
Louise Fitz, of Newton Centre, Mass.

The mounting and arrangement of plates are vexed questions among
collectors. The really satisfactory method has not yet been discovered.
Many ways are tried; and experience shows that while one may at
different times think he has found the very best way, its disadvantages
are sure to appear, and a new method will be looked for.

Mr. E. H. Bierstadt, of New York, keeps his collection in large albums
constructed for the purpose. The leaves are of double thicknesses of
heavy calendered manilla paper. The plates are pasted down on mounts of
a stiff white ledger paper, and are then placed in the book, four to the
page, by slipping the corners of the mounts into slits cut for the
purpose in the page. This allows the easy readjustment, the easy
exchange of a poor specimen for a better one, the re-placing of a plate
wrongly classed, and the extension of alphabetical arrangement _ad
infinitum_. The appearance of the volume is handsome.

Mr. Henry Blackwell, of New York, is mounting all his plates on rather
large sheets of a stiff paper, of a dark tint, which shows off the
plates to good advantage. They are arranged in alphabetical order, and
are kept in neat wooden boxes.

The plates of Mr. Pickering Dodge, of Washington, D.C., are mounted on a
dove-colored mount, which is an advantageous tint. The plates are
arranged according to styles. This collector, however, is about to
change to albums.

Mr. Nathaniel Paine, of Worcester, Mass., has his plates mounted
directly upon the pages of an album made for them. Portraits, views,
etc., are also interspersed.

The present writer used originally the individual mount; but becoming
dissatisfied with that method, because of injury by careless handling,
adopted the albums, using in both instances the “hinges” of the stamp
collector to fasten the plates down with. He is now changing back to the
individual-mount plan, as it admits of more freedom in comparison, easy
changes, and the better display of the collection, either to a few, or
to an audience.

The larger part of our collectors do not mount their plates at all, or
have any system of arranging them. They are kept in odd envelopes,
boxes, between the leaves of books, or in a desk-drawer, and there await
the new arrival, or the shaking up incident to the search for a
particular specimen. This is ruinous.

The larger part of our collectors are members of the Ex Libris Society,
of England, while many have also joined the societies in France and
Germany. No American Society has as yet been seriously proposed.

THE AMERICAN BIBLIOGRAPHY.

_By Eben Newell Hewins._

Book-plate collecting in the United States is of such recent growth that
the literature on the subject is naturally limited, consisting of only a
few scattered magazine and newspaper articles.

The compiler desires his thanks to all who have assisted him in his
work; and especially would he thank Mr. H. W. Fincham and Mr. James
Roberts Brown, for kind permission to use their exhaustive English
Bibliography, which is here reprinted from the journal of the Ex Libris
Society; and also Mr. Walter Hamilton, for permission to use his
Bibliography, prepared for his “Hand-Book of French Book-Plates.”

CONCLUSION.


[Illustration: T]he end of our pleasant task is reached; and it only
remains to thank the gentle reader who has kindly followed us, and to
re-assert as a parting word, that this work does not aspire to cover
every point which collectors may wish to have decided. Its modest
purpose will be served if any reader is led to take an interest in the
subject, if collectors find it useful as an assistant in intelligent
collecting, or an instigation to further and more careful research.

Undoubtedly, there lie in old garrets, book-cases, and forgotten
cupboards, dust-covered books, in which some fortunate searcher will one
day discover plates as yet unknown. It is hoped that any such will
publish their success for the benefit of the steadily increasing number
who find something interesting in these memorials of the past, and who
take pleasure in their preservation and pride in their possession.

1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

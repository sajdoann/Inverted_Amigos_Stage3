_A Public Opportunity to Contribute Once a Year._—That is, we
think, a modest claim for the almoners of your bounty to make. Will
you secure it for us in your church this year?

       *       *       *       *       *

We need very much two communion services—one for the Midway church,
Golding’s Grove, Ga., and the other for the new church at Cypress
Slash. Who will send them to us?

       *       *       *       *       *

A pastor of an M. E. Church South, in Georgia, asked us by mail,
the other day, for a hundred copies of the AMERICAN MISSIONARY to
put on a Christmas tree for members of his church, that he might
thus awaken more interest in the missionary cause. We sent them.
This is the first time we were ever asked to send our publications
as “Christmas greens.”

       *       *       *       *       *

How the angels must smile when they see a man whom God has greatly
prospered carefully take a hundred dollars out of a hundred
thousand that he has laid away, and hear him say to himself, with
a chuckle of self-complacency: “Yes, we are only stewards; we must
deal generously by these good causes; I will give that to the
Lord.” A pauper giving crumbs in charity to the King on whom he
depends for daily bread! But then there are some who do not give
even the crumbs.—_Congregationalist._

       *       *       *       *       *

In this month of February, we publish, according to our custom,
the list of our missionaries and teachers in the field; and we are
proud of it, not for its length or numbers, but for the high and
approved character of those who constitute it; nay, rather, we are
thankful to Him under whom we all labor, that He has given to us
and to each other so worthy a band of co-laborers, so intelligent
and so devoted. We do not forget that these pastors and teachers
are far from their homes, and that each is known personally to but
a limited number of the friends of the Association, and we bespeak
for them not only a general but a personal remembrance. Would it
not be well to select some one whose work you, reader, will follow
with especial interest, to whom you will some time write, assuring
of your interest and prayers, and with whom you may establish and
maintain a personal friendship? Pray for some one at least in this
list by name, and you will be less likely to forget to pray for all
the rest.

“_Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion; build thou the walls of
Jerusalem._”—So, in that hour of unearthly experience as recorded
in the fifty-first Psalm, does David’s heart leap from the state of
penitence and of forgiveness to take in the welfare of Zion. So,
evermore, does the truest devotion inspire the missionary spirit.
The first burden of our Lord’s Prayer is for a heavenly Kingdom
on earth. His last prayer with and for His disciples, that they
might be kept, and sanctified and glorified, was, “that the world
may believe that thou hast sent me.” It is the instinct of a soul
in communion with God, that in every prayer it should utter at
least one petition for the coming of his Kingdom. So often do our
lyric hymns, which are but a transcript of Christian experience,
glance off from almost any line of thought and of feeling, to utter
the great aspiration for the crowning of Christ in His spiritual
realm. The nearer we come to God, the more do we long to have Him
enthroned in all hearts.

ARRIVAL OF MR. NURSE IN AFRICA.

Mr. Miller writes: “I am very glad to be able to announce to you
the arrival of Bro. Nurse from America to join our work in Western
Africa. His voyage was rather longer than had been expected, and he
doubtless grew impatient as the ship neared this place, and stood
several days under the silent influence of a calm.

“Yesterday was Thanksgiving-day with you at home—not less so with
him and his mother, from whom he had been separated for many
years, as they met in warm embrace. How freely the tears rolled
down the cheeks of that overjoyed mother, as she looked upon her
son returned to her and the ‘dark continent,’ a missionary of the
Gospel to assist in lifting up degraded, perishing mankind. Bro.
Nurse is a little worn-out from his long voyage, but will soon get
well rested, and we shall leave for Sherbro.”

       *       *       *       *       *


KNOWING, GIVING, PRAYING.

These are the three strands of the rope by which the car of
missions is drawn. This is the trinity of Christian work. The three
are one, and each one is only itself fully as it is with the three.

One can have little interest in knowing of a work for which he
neither gives nor prays. His knowledge will be indefinite and
easily forgotten. It has no grip in it such as comes from a
personal connection. In the nation’s war, men and women thought
of it, read of it, were eager to know the latest tidings, because
their sons and their wealth had been given to the cause which they
believed was God’s, and their prayers were daily following as they
traced the progress of the day.

No one will give generously or sufficiently when he has not taken
pains to know. You cannot get up much enthusiasm over a mere list
of stations or catalogue of workers. Dr. Albert Bushnell says that
half the Presbyterian churches in the United States give nothing to
the cause of foreign missions, and that many who do not give do not
pray. We should be willing to go further than that and say that
none who do not give can pray effectually. They may repeat prayers
possibly in public for missions, because that is the proper thing
to do, but such are but “vain repetitions” against which we are
warned.

We all agree that missions need the prayers of Christians; that
such prayer is the duty of all who bear the name of Christ. Then it
is equally a duty for all such to fulfil the conditions by which
they may be able to pray aright. It is a duty to know about the
progress of the Redeemer’s cause. If He bids us say, “Thy kingdom
come,” He will not be content with us if we sit with closed eyes,
indifferent to the signs of its coming. But how many Christian
people take pains to keep themselves informed of the affairs of the
nations of the earth, their wars, their acts, their commerce, and
skip the paragraphs which tell of the contests and conquests of
Christ’s kingdom! How many who know of the strifes and supremacies
of parties in Maine and Mississippi, know nothing at all of the
religious state or progress of our land! Is it likely that such
will give much, or pray earnestly?

Nor will they pray aright unless they give. That makes it their
work. That establishes their interest in it. That, if it be
real giving—not mere throwing away to avoid the trouble or the
embarrassment of saying No—based on intelligent appreciation of the
need, enlarges and emphasizes and doubly underscores the prayer
which, then, with the alms ascending, will surely find their way to
God together.

Friends, we want your prayers for us, for our workers and for our
work. But we want prayers that are weighted by your gifts—they
will rise the better for it; and that are illuminated with your
intelligence—they will be read the better for it, even by the
Father who “dwelleth in light.”

TILLOTSON COLLEGIATE AND NORMAL INSTITUTE, AUSTIN, TEXAS.

This school was founded on the same comprehensive scale as
the other chartered institutions of the American Missionary
Association. In 1876, a beautiful site of eight acres, overlooking
the valley of the Colorado River and the mountains beyond,
was secured in the city of Austin, the capital of Texas, and
subsequently paid for by the originator of the enterprise, Rev.
Geo. J. Tillotson. Efforts were commenced at once to raise the
funds for the first building, which is to serve all the purposes of
a boarding school until the growth and ability of the institution
shall necessitate and provide others. Dea. David Allen, of
Connecticut, headed the subscription with $1,000, and to this
amount has since added $250. David Banks, of Stanwich, Conn., a
gentleman over 80 years of age, raised $1,200 more, subscribing
one-third of it himself. The remainder of the amount we now have
on hand was collected for the most part by Mr. Tillotson, who has
kindly added the gift of his services to the enterprise founded by
his liberality. The principal benefactors of the institution are
all over seventy years of age.

Work on the new building was commenced last summer, and is still
going on. It is being constructed of brick, with some trimmings,
and will have accommodations for seventy boarding students. The
funds at our disposal for the object are barely sufficient to
inclose the building. We need $7,000 additional in order to finish
and furnish it for occupation by the 1st of October. The money
already given, amounting to about $11,000, exclusive of the $5,000
paid for the site, was subscribed largely in sums of $400 each by
persons who are to have the privilege of naming the students’
rooms, of which there will be thirty-five. A grand example has been
given. Are there not others ready to follow?

The burden of debt, and the struggle required to maintain the
institutions already under way, has deterred this Association,
during the past three years, from pressing the claims of this,
our only school in Texas; but we believe the time has now come
when we should earnestly solicit the gifts needful for its speedy
completion. Already we have received the written indorsement of
seventy-six of the leading citizens of Austin, saying, “We believe
that such a school is very much needed, and that the enterprise
will be hailed by very many of our best citizens as of great
importance to the welfare of the State.” Texas has a territory
larger than France, and constitutes no mean part of “the whole
world” where we are commanded to go and teach. Will our friends aid
us to go up at once and possess the land?

WHO SHALL CIVILIZE AFRICA?

We copy from the _Tribune_ the following opinion of Col. C. Chaillé
Long, the African explorer, who preceded Stanley by a year in
visiting Mtesa:

If the heart of Africa is ever reached by civilizing influences,
Colonel Long thinks the work must be done by intelligent colored
people from the United States. They, if anybody, could keep
communications open, introduce trade, and gradually train the
natives in habits of systematic industry. Last spring, when public
attention was attracted to the exodus of negroes from the Southern
States, Colonel Long wrote a letter to the King of Belgium, who
is President of the principal European society for exploring and
civilizing Africa. In that letter he proposed that the King should
stimulate, through the medium of his society, a movement to take a
large body of the discontented blacks from our Southern States and
settle them in Central Africa, opening with them a line of trading
and missionary posts from the West Coast to the lake country.

Colonel Long believed that thousands of the most industrious and
best educated colored men in the Gulf States could be induced to
go. Their presence in Africa would, he wrote, create no surprise or
hostility among the natives, and they would soon acquire influence
over the native tribes and start the work of civilization. In this
way the experiment of opening the dark continent would be tried
under the only conditions that afford the least promise of success.
King Leopold wrote in reply that the project deeply interested him,
and that he should give it his careful investigation, but nothing
further has been heard from him. Colonel Long says it would cost
a great deal of money to carry out the scheme, but the African
exploring societies in Europe could raise it if they tried. He is
not enthusiastic about the success of his plan, but is confident
that it is the only one not foredoomed to failure. Equatorial
Africa, he insists, will never be civilized by white men.

ITEMS FROM THE FIELD.

MACON, GA.—Pastor S. E. Lathrop is getting under way his
Circulating Library for the colored people. He sends out a
circular, printed on his own “Gospel Press,” that was given him
as a home missionary in Wisconsin, appealing for the gift of new
or second-hand books for this purpose. Gov. Colquitt and Senators
Gordon and Hill have furnished some. Pres. A. L. Chapin, of
Beloit, Wis., is putting up a trunk full. Sup’t Roy sent in a
“carpet-bag” full. Who’ll follow up?

MACON, GA.—A graduate from the Lewis High School writes: “I have
worked faithfully for three months. I was assigned to a place where
there was no school-house or church. The people had their meeting
under an arbor. I worked with the patrons of the place until they
built me a school-house. Since that they have erected a church at
the expense of $350. It is 35 by 45 feet. We are holding protracted
meetings. Three persons have been received in full connection,
and many more are hovering around the altar. Our Sunday-school is
prospering. Many are coming in. The old folks are more interested
in this great work than the young. We are hammering down upon them.
My school numbers thirty-nine scholars. I have received several
petitions from the colored people, asking me to come again and
teach for them.”

MCINTOSH, LIBERTY CO., GA.—A pleasant and profitable Sunday-school
concert and Christmas exercise was held in the Dorchester Midway
church. Mr. McIntosh, the superintendent and teacher, and Miss
Douglass, the missionary, are doing good and successful work. Rev.
Floyd Snelson is the pastor, and his children gave some exhibitions
of their African treasures and experience. A watch-night
prayer-meeting was held at his house New Year’s eve.

CYPRESS SLASH, GA.—The people are getting up timbers for their new
meeting-house.

TOUGALOO, MISS.—We have had a blessed work here this week. Several
of our pupils had been very thoughtful for a great while, some of
them a year, and one or two even longer. They had held out stoutly,
but last Sabbath afternoon one yielded. Saturday night, several
asked for prayers. After church, three young men were converted.
Monday morning, twelve more yielded. Monday afternoon, one of the
most stubborn cases I ever met came into the fold. She had been
trying to climb up some other way for more than two years. Tuesday
afternoon another gave up, making in all eighteen within two days.
Our term closed on Wednesday. Several went to their homes very
anxious. I hope they may still be brought within the fold.

FLORENCE, ALA.—The new church edifice mentioned in our last number
was first planned through the benevolence of Mrs. J. Fowler,
of Mendon, Ill., who contributed fully one-third of the total
cost, and thus laid the foundation of this good enterprise. The
completion of the work was made possible by “Howard.”

WASHINGTON, D. C.—The American Missionary Association has called
Rev. Simon P. Smith to a missionary work among the colored people
of Washington. The Lincoln Mission, a Sabbath-school enterprise
connected with the Congregational Church, has offered its capacious
building, and here may yet arise a colored Congregational church.
Mr. Smith is a colored clergyman, a graduate of Howard and then of
Chicago Seminary, and well fitted for his work.—_Congregationalist._

GENERAL NOTES.


The Freedmen.

—The school work of the Presbyterian Church among the Freedmen
reports 39 schools, 4,184 scholars, 58 (or, including 16 ministers
and 6 catechists engaged in teaching in addition to their other
duties, 80) teachers; making in both departments, including a
few assistant teachers, 140 missionaries. Five of their higher
schools report 1,126 pupils, of whom 145 taught part of the year,
reporting 7,513 pupils. Of the teachers from four of these schools,
77 superintended Sabbath-schools while teaching, and reported 4,043
Sabbath-school scholars. These four schools report also 51 students
preparing for the Gospel ministry.

—The M. E. Church, through its Freedmen’s Aid Society, has aided
in establishing and supporting 6 chartered colleges, 3 theological
and one medical school, and 9 institutions not chartered. In
these institutions the number of pupils taught during the year
is classified as follows: Biblical, 453; law, 20; medical, 60;
collegiate, 74; academic, 270; normal, 1,020; intermediate, 242;
primary, 371. Total, 2,510.

—A colored lawyer was recently admitted to practice in the Court
of Appeals of Virginia. He is the first colored man who has ever
enjoyed this privilege in that State. The motion for his admission
was made by the son of ex-Gov. Wise.

       *       *       *       *       *


Africa.

—On the 8th of July, Mr. James Stewart, C. E., then in charge
of the Nyassa Mission, wrote to the Convener from Livingstonia.
After building a dwelling-house for the head of the mission at
Livingstonia, he sailed north to visit the stations of Marenga and
Kaningina. He found all well. The Mangoni chiefs had presented
the mission with eleven cows, but insist on their being used only
in the country around Kaningina. Our own cattle—most precious
property—were in good condition. At Livingstonia, advancing
cultivation had driven off the pestilent and fatal tsetse fly.
After a fortnight’s holiday, the school-boys and girls had returned
to Christian instruction. Mr. Stewart had distributed toys and
handkerchiefs as prizes at the examination. Namalambi, “a fine,
promising boy,” was dux of the school. Mr. Stewart had already

The Indians.

—The Hon. Carl Schurz, Secretary of the Interior, devotes a large
portion of his annual report to the Indian question. He states that
the hostile Indians at the West are few compared with the whole
number of the race. He states the Indian policy of the Department
to be as follows:

“The ends steadily pursued by it are: _First_, to set the Indians
to work as agriculturists or herders, thus to break up their
habits of savage life and to make them self-supporting; _second_,
to educate their youth of both sexes, so as to introduce to the
growing generation civilized ideas, wants and aspirations; _third_,
to allot parcels of land to the Indians in severalty, and to give
them individual titles to their farms in fee, inalienable for a
certain period, thus to foster the pride of individual ownership
of property, instead of their former dependence upon the tribe,
with its territory held in common; _fourth_, when settlement in
severalty with individual title is accomplished, to dispose, with
their consent, of those lands on their reservations which are not
settled and used by them, the proceeds to form a fund for their
benefit which will gradually relieve the Government of the expenses
at present provided for by the annual appropriations; _fifth_ when
this is accomplished, to treat the Indians like other inhabitants
of the United States under the laws of the land.

“This policy, if adopted and supported by Congress, and carried out
with wisdom and firmness, will in my opinion gradually bring about
a solution of the Indian problem, without injustice to the Indians,
and also without obstructing the development of the country. It
will raise them to a level of civilization at least equal to that
of the civilized tribes in the Indian Territory, and probably to
a higher one, considering the stimulus of individual ownership in
land. It will not take away from them by force what in justice and
equity belongs to them, but induce them to part with what they
cannot cultivate and use themselves for a fair compensation. It
will open to progress and improvement large districts now held by
Indians, which will then be of no real advantage to them and are
now to nobody else.”

The Chinese.

—Last February, Congress passed the bill prohibiting Chinese
immigration which was vetoed by President Hayes. The very next day
the new anti-Chinese constitution was adopted by the convention in
California, denying the Chinaman the right to land, to labor, to
vote, or even to live in any town or city. Soon came on the other
side a decision of the Federal courts, adjudging the queue-cutting
ordinance to be an unconstitutional violation of personal rights;
and another, asserting that the treaty with China, granting its
people a right of residence, gave them also a right of labor, and
forbade any State to prohibit their employment. Chinese merchants
meanwhile, unwilling to give up the commercial advantages assured
to them by treaty, are establishing a line of steamers from China
to the Sandwich Islands, and a connecting line thence to the
Pacific coast. This record of the year’s events is memorable and
full of suggestiveness.

CONFERENCE REVIEW.

This review of the state of religion in the Congregational churches
of South Carolina and of Georgia, during this first year of their
General Conference, shows abundant occasion of gratitude for
general prosperity and spiritual blessing.

The fact that all of our fourteen churches except one, have been
represented in this Conference by their ministers and delegates,
reveals an interest in its meetings, and in the doctrine of
the fellowship of the churches, that is truly delightful. In
this connection we cannot refrain from noting the grace of God
conferred upon the churches in their custom of providing the
necessary traveling expenses of their delegates. We hope that such
messengers of the churches will reciprocate this consideration, and
magnify their office, by making a full report of this and all such
convocations to their respective assemblies for worship.

We gratefully recognize the increase of our total membership by
354, making the present number 949. One new church has been
organized, that of Cypress Slash, which reports to us a membership
of 54; a temporary cabin, built as a place for church and school,
with the purpose soon to erect a more comely and permanent
sanctuary; and also a new young minister who, with his wife, is
already reaping missionary fruit.

We note with gratification that every one of our churches is
supplied with the ministry of the word, except that at Marietta,
whose pastor, Rev. S. P. Smith, has been transferred to Washington
City for the purpose of building up the 2d Congregational Church at
the capital. So, with the same exception, every one of our churches
has its own house of worship. Some of these are commodious and
tasteful; others are very plain; but all are places of sanctuary
comfort, and the worshippers are striving each year to increase
their comeliness and convenience. During the year, three of these
congregations have added to their meeting-houses the attraction of
the church-going bell. Among a people, few of whom have clocks or
watches, the church bell is their time-keeper, and the promoter
of that promptness which adds a charm to the services of public
worship.

The doctrine of church discipline as a means of grace has been
illustrated by a heroic use of the pruning knife upon these vines,
that they may bring forth more fruit. The seeking of a clean
membership is essential to the healthfulness and well-being of the
churches.

The cause of temperance has been kept near the heart of our
members. One church, the Pilgrim, at Woodville, has a large and
influential Band of Hope. All preach temperance and require its
practice among their members. We are deeply convinced that the
habit of intemperance is the devil’s best grip upon the poor and
lowly people among whom we have our lot and our work, and that
total abstinence is the only consistent rule for Christians. In
a community where pastors and officers and members of Protestant
churches indulge in the practice of drinking liquors, we feel
called upon to bear an unremitting and uncompromising testimony
against this violation of the spirit and the precept of the Gospel.

We are confirmed in the wisdom of the union of the school-work
and the church-work in our evangelizing process. The school
prepares the way for the church. It brings along the young and
hopeful material for the church membership. The church garners up
such fruit. It reacts upon the school and the community by its
educating and elevating influence. In our ideal, both unite in the
one purpose of saving and edifying the souls of men. We desire
to express our sincere gratefulness in view of the devoted and
self-denying labor of the teachers in the schools associated with
our churches.

The higher schools and colleges within our bounds have gone along
upon the plane of their former success. The Avery Institute, at
Charleston, has passed through a change of administration without
any diminution of its members or lowering of its high grade of
scholarship. The Normal School at Greenwood, S. C., has held on in
its beneficent way, enjoying the fine building and campus of an
old time Baptist College. The Beach Institute in this city, with
its cultivated and consecrated corps of seven teachers, with its
fine body of pupils, with its thorough discipline and its decided
moral and religious tone, is a power for good in this community
and in this part of the State. The Dorchester Academy at Midway,
the Lewis High School at Macon, and the Storrs School at Atlanta,
have kept steadily upon the line of their extensive and beneficent
influence. The Atlanta University maintains its high position as
to classical and normal scholarship, and as to moral and religious
tone, approved by the authorities of the Commonwealth and also
by the favor of Heaven, in the enrolling during the year of a
couple of score of its students among the disciples of the Great
Master. Its independent Union Church, with 67 members, although not
belonging to our body, is to us a sister in Christ, for whom our
prayers and sympathies shall ever abound. Its Faculty consists
of three graduates of Yale and one each of Harvard, Dartmouth and
Amherst Colleges, and of half a dozen cultivated ladies. To these
it has just added Prof. A. W. Farnham, who is introducing the most
approved normal methods, not only for the benefit of the normal
scholars but of all in the University. More than a dozen of its
graduates are now teaching high schools in leading cities of the
State of Georgia, and so starting from these centres, radiating
influences that shall bless many more communities. We give thanks
to God for the bequest of $50,000, by which the University will now
be able to add still more to its spacious accommodations.

We greatly rejoice in the new feature of the work within our
limits, that of lady missionaries. We have four of them. One of
these has been located at Charleston, one at Miller’s Station, one
at Macon, and one in Atlanta. Woman’s work for women and children
in these communities, we consider a Christly service of the utmost
value. Woman can enter the homes as the pastor cannot; and yet she
will make work for him in following up her discoveries. Her ready
sympathy and happy tact will help her in stimulating to greater
domestic comfort, and will aid her in doing good through many ways
that are peculiarly her own.

We are comforted by the educated young men who are coming forward
to minister in our churches. Besides those who have been raised up
in the “Beach” to minister to the churches that cluster about it,
we are happy in the coming of four graduates of the Theological
department of Talladega College in Alabama, three of whom are this
week receiving ordination at the hands of our own church councils,
and the other is the moderator of one of these Convocations. We are
happy to express grateful obligation to that Christian institution
in another State for this gift of her cultured sons, who are to us
also a part of the ascension gift of our blessed Lord.

We are devoutly grateful to God for the spiritual refreshings that
have been enjoyed this year in our churches and schools. Some have
had special seasons of revival. Others have had the dew in the
fleece. Many souls have been brought into fellowship with Christ,
and Christians have, we trust, been advanced somewhat in the
process of purification.

We cannot conclude this annual narrative without recording our
gratitude to the American Missionary Association, which, under God,
has been the occasion within a short period of all this school and
church development as now represented by the Conference of Georgia.
We remind ourselves, also, that this is only one of seven of these
Conferences which have been the outgrowth of the same general
Christianizing process at the South. We magnify the grace of God
bestowed upon the churches and friends who have furnished that
Association with the funds, the prayers and the sympathies, that
were essential to this great work. “This is the Lord’s doing; it is
marvelous in our eyes.”

EDUCATIONAL REPORT.

At the Georgia Conference the Committee on Education make the
following report:

That “Education is the handmaid of Religion” has become an accepted
maxim. To be remembered everywhere, it is of especial importance
in this field. Religion has here been corrupted by ignorance, and
has often degenerated into superstition. A devout and imaginative
spirit has been betrayed into serious errors and gross excesses
in the name of truth and godliness. More knowledge, more culture
of mind, is necessary in many cases to prepare the way for the
perception of the truth. The one great object of the Church of
Christ in its labor among men is to save the souls of men by
holding forth the word of Life; but to attain this, the Church must
help to teach them what that word is, and how to read and study
it for themselves. The Gospel seeks to prepare men, not only for
the next life, but for this life also. It is fitted to bless the
whole man, physical and mental, as well as spiritual. Education
and Gospel piety must go together. The Committee would, therefore,
recommend the adoption of the following resolutions:

1. _Resolved_, That this Conference desires to emphasize the fact
that the past year’s experience gives new occasion for gratitude
that from the beginning of the American Missionary Association’s
work in this field, the school and the church have been closely
united.

2. _Resolved_, That it is the deliberate judgment of this
Conference that this field still requires the enlargement and
vigorous prosecution of the school work, as a necessary aid to the
upbuilding of our churches.

3. _Resolved_, That the churches must not cease to pray fervently
for those who are teaching in our elementary and higher schools,
and for their pupils, that the instruction given and the mental
culture gained may bear the stamp of Christian consecration.

4. _Resolved_, That we desire to express our _warm sympathy with
our young people_, who, in the face of many obstacles, are bravely
pressing forward in their studies, to fit themselves for teachers
or preachers, and would urge them to get as thorough and complete
an education as possible.

  Respectfully submitted,

                                                C. W. HAWLEY,
                                                T. T. BENSON,

ATLANTA MISCELLANIES.

BY A RESIDENT.

—A Christmas concert was observed by the Sunday-school of the
First Congregational Church of Atlanta, Georgia. It followed Dr.
Vincent’s programme, which, with variations, was rendered with
great success. The singing was excellent. The recitations and the
responsive readings of Scripture were impressive. The recitations
on the platform, of prose or poetry, a score or more, did not have
a failure or a prompting. Every piece during the whole evening
was about Christmas. The good reading and elocution were apparent
as the result of the good training in the Storrs School, whose
teachers are also instructors in the Sunday-school. Pastor C. W.
Hawley seemed in his element as the leader of this service. Sup’t
Roy made a talk at the close. The school numbers two hundred and
twenty-five. It would greatly gladden the hearts of the friends of
our work if they could only look in upon this and the many other
such schools in the South.

Atlanta has a monthly Sunday-school Teachers’ Institute.
Pastor Hawley attends it. Atlanta’s County, Fulton, has also a
Sunday-school Association, which convenes in the city quarterly.
At the last meeting, as interest was warming up in favor of
taking some more practical measures toward helping the colored
Sunday-schools, it was found that the constitution limited the
membership to such schools as were “all white.” Whereupon a
_resolution_ of interest and of encouragement was adopted. At the
last meeting of the State S. S. Association, held in Macon, a
colored school in Savannah applied for membership. The matter was
quieted for the time, but it is said that it will come up again.
Upon the recommendation of Gov. Colquitt it is proposed to adopt
the Brooklyn idea of a Children’s Day once a year; this not only
for the City but for the State. In Atlanta there are fourteen
colored Sunday-schools.

—At an entertainment at the Atlanta University, during the
holidays, the Field Superintendent gave one of his addresses upon
the map of the United States.

—At the watch-night service in the Trinity M. E. South Church, of
Atlanta, one of the speakers, Rev. Dr. Potter, a Presiding Elder,
dwelling upon the openings of benevolence during the last year,
expatiated at length upon the million of dollars given by one
estate to the American Board. Surely the children of light are
beginning to do business upon something of the grand scale on which
the children of this world project their schemes. It was stated
at that meeting that during the year, under Pastor Heidt, the
Trinity Church had received two hundred members, half of them upon
confession of faith, and had paid off a debt of twenty thousand
dollars. It seems that the M. E. General Conference, South, has
abolished the feature of a six months’ probation. Only those are
received who give evidence of conversion. The form in receiving a
member that night was quite Congregational. This church has also
advanced upon the policy of its sister at the North, in allowing a
_four_ years’ pastorate, instead of _three_.

FLORIDA.

Letter from Rev. Geo. Henry.

DEAR SIR: I opened last Monday a day-school in addition to our
Sunday-school. The necessity of this step will be apparent when I
tell you that there are fifty children in this place who wish to
attend school, but have been unable heretofore to do so, as the
distance to the nearest colored school is from four to seven miles
from their homes. Only a few of the larger ones have been able to
attend.

In my school I have dull and bright, lazy and industrious children,
as you have in all other schools, but taking them altogether, they
study as well and learn as quickly as any set of pupils I have ever
seen. I have one little girl who did not know the alphabet last
Monday, but by the end of the week was able to read little stories
from a Reader rapidly and accurately. I have never anywhere seen
such progress made by a young child.

In view of the capability of the children to learn, there can
scarcely be reason to doubt that the deplorable mental condition of
the adult Freedmen is due to that institution which has been such a
curse both to the slave and his owner. The public schools are open
from three to four months each year; but so far they have been of
very little use to the colored children, as they have been, as a
rule, taught by incompetent persons. Most of the colored schools
have colored teachers, and very few of them are either morally or
intellectually qualified for the position. For example, the man who
taught the school nearest to this place last winter used to bring
his bottle with him to school. A woman of bad character and only
rudimentary education has the same school this winter; yet this is
one of the largest schools in the county. In a conversation which
I had with Judge B——, a member of the Board of Public Instruction,
he said that “the school money which had been spent for colored
schools had been thrown away, for the children had not learned
anything.” This is very nearly a correct statement of the case, for
a bright child ten years of age would learn more in two months than
boys 19 or 20 years old know who have attended these schools for
years. Understand me, I think this is the fault of the teachers and
not of the pupils.

I believe that in my week-day school I shall be able to do as much
for the improvement of the condition of the Freedmen as in any
other way, and I am sure if you were here to look over the field
you would agree with me.

Our work in the Sunday-school is also very encouraging; not that
the scholars are uniting with the church—for nearly all the older
ones are members of churches now—but they are learning from the
word of God those truths which are calculated to prepare them for
useful lives in the earth and eternal happiness in the world to
come.

LOUISIANA.

The Schools and the Churches.

BY REV. W. S. ALEXANDER.

The work of education and evangelization among the Freedmen in
this State was never more hopeful. By the provisions of the new
constitution which was adopted at the recent election, the rate of
taxation has been greatly reduced, and as a direct consequence,
the appropriation for school purposes will be correspondingly cut
down. The free colored schools will be the first to be struck by
this wave of retrenchment. Many schools, especially in the country
parishes, will be closed, or, at the best, be maintained for a
very brief period in the year. New Orleans will feel this matter
as keenly as the country, for the amount of taxation is strictly
regulated by the new constitution. Only special gifts can possibly
keep the schools up to the present standard. One of the most
prominent educators in the city said to me, “I would not raise
unnecessarily the cry of alarm, but a crisis is surely near at hand
with our public schools.” The colored Normal School will certainly
be discontinued. The Peabody fund will probably not be available
for Louisiana another year. All these events, so unpropitious to
the free school system of Louisiana, and so deeply to be deplored,
render our work all the more necessary, and our prospect of
enlarged usefulness the brighter.

When we see the grand opportunity opening before our beloved
University—an opportunity which has not the remotest resemblance
to the fictitious and dreamy—we try to forget the plaintive words,
“Hope deferred maketh the heart sick,” and rally our courage by the
more inspiring prophecy, “The morning light is breaking.”

When the glorious work of enlargement begins, will it not be in
order to start at the Gulf of Mexico and gradually work up? We
rather approve of that plan and are quite ready for it.

CHURCH WORK IN LOUISIANA.

“We hold our own, and something more,” is the word that comes up
from the churches of our Association. Our annual meeting will
be held at _Terrebonne_, the first Wednesday in April, and the
brethren are eagerly anticipating it. Congregationalism is a
plant of slow growth among the colored people, not from want of
adaptation, but from lack of money to push it into fields now
unoccupied or uncultivated. Money is needed to give new enterprises
substantial encouragement in their difficult “beginnings”—to tide
the pastors past the _starvation_ point—to give them “foothold”
till strength comes to them in the natural growth of a good
enterprise.

The church at New Iberia, which welcomed our last annual
conference, and which is memorable as the scene of a most precious
revival, and suffered seriously in the loss, by a furious wind
storm in September, of their tasteful and commodious chapel, is
rallying grandly from the shock. By liberal subscriptions, by
mortgaging their property, and by personal labor, they have put
up and covered the frame of a larger building, and have stopped
before finishing, simply because they could do no more. Two hundred
dollars will put the new chapel in order for dedication. Shall they
appeal in vain? We cannot afford to lose or to cripple this church.
It has been a bright light on the prairie, and though the tempest
levelled the building, it cannot—it must not—extinguish the light.

Our own, the Central Church, sends greeting to all kind,
sympathizing and praying friends in the North. All summer long,
the members of the church have prayed in public and in private for
a gracious out-pouring of the Divine Spirit. I found the church in
an earnest, praying state. A greater degree of unity and cordial
Christian fellowship prevails than I have ever before seen.
To-morrow (Sunday, Jan. 4,) begins the “Week of Prayer.” If, in its
results, it shall fulfil the longings and faith of this people,
then will it indeed be the “Week of Weeks” to us in Central Church.
Last night, at our preparatory service, seventy-five were present;
five new members were received, of whom three came on profession of
faith. It was a meeting of peculiar tenderness and spiritual power.
After a brief lecture by the pastor, forty-two Christians spoke
tender, earnest words of love to God, and devotion to His service.
God grant I may have good tidings to send you in my next letter.

TENNESSEE.

Labor Among Convicts.

PROF. H. S. BENNETT, NASHVILLE.

I have been superintendent of the Sunday-school in the Penitentiary
of Tennessee, located at Nashville, for nine years, and several of
the teachers of Fisk University have done so much in connection
with that school that the work done there becomes a part of the
influence of Fisk University. Hence, a brief description of a
powerful work of grace, which has been in progress during the past
three months, will appropriately find place in the columns of the
MISSIONARY.

During my connection with the prison school, several seasons of
refreshing have been witnessed, and hundreds of the prisoners have
expressed a hope in Christ.

On returning from the North and resuming my duties as
superintendent in the prison, in September, I noticed an unusual
interest in the study of the Bible lesson. The remarks which were
made at the close of the lesson were listened to with breathless
interest. The interest was so marked that it was determined
to give an opportunity to those who might desire to present
themselves for prayers. This was done, and upwards of one hundred
prisoners presented themselves. After a brief prayer-meeting,
the prisoners were dismissed. On the next Sabbath, five or six
made a profession of their faith in Christ, having been converted
through the week. The work thus begun went on for two months,
only one meeting for inquiry being held each week, and that at
the close of the Sabbath-school. Another meeting was held on
Sabbath morning, at which regular services were conducted by the
chaplain. Each Sabbath, from three to six reported that they had
found the Saviour. A deep religious interest pervaded the entire
prison. Wherever little groups of prisoners were to be found, their
conversation was upon the subject of religion. All the teachers
felt that the Lord was present in power. At the end of two months
thirty-five had found the Saviour, and ten or twelve backsliders
had been reclaimed.

On the last Sabbath of November an unusual scene was witnessed
within the prison walls. Thirty-four prisoners were received into
the prison church. As the long row of prisoners, arrayed in the
stripes of the criminal, stood up to take upon them the covenant
vows of the church, it was perceived that the work had been very
great.

Of the candidates, eight or ten were baptized by sprinkling, the
rest by immersion. Ten or twelve remain to be taken into the church.

The influence of the work among the prisoners is seen to be very
salutary. The church service and the Sabbath-school are the two
bright spots in the lives of the prisoners. From twenty to
twenty-eight teachers, of both sexes and colors, Northern and
Southern, engage in the work. Three hundred pupils, prisoners,
attend with remarkable regularity, as the attendance is optional.
The influence of the religious work is to inspire the prisoners
with hope, and with a purpose to retrieve whatever they have lost
by their folly and crime in the past. Scores of them go out and
live useful and honorable lives. Of this we have abundant proof.

WOMAN’S WORK AMONG WOMEN.

Answers to Prayer—“Scrubbing up with the Bible.”

MISS HATTIE A. MILTON, MEMPHIS, TENN.

My heart is overflowing with thanks-giving, not so much for the
great results that I have already seen—for the greatest results
in this work are discerned only by the eye of faith—but that I am
permitted to be the instrument, even in a humble way, of answering
your prayers, and not only yours, but those of the poor suffering
people here. So many times when administering to their wants, not
only when giving them loaves and fishes, but when pointing them to
a higher spiritual and moral life, they have remarked, “Miss, I
know the Lord sent you in answer to prayer.”

Sometimes I hesitate about going to places, and think I will do
some other duty that day; but when the thought comes to me that it
may be an opportunity to answer somebody’s prayer, I feel that I
must go. Again, many times have my friends in the North answered
my prayers. I will mention one instance which struck me as being
remarkable. A very poor woman came to me asking for clothing for
the little helpless children of her dying sister. I had just
given out the last garment; but while talking with her I put up a
prayer that something would come soon, and told her that I thought
I should have something for her in a few days. Just then the
door-bell rang, and I went to the door and found there a box, which
I opened at once, and in it beheld the answer to my prayer! It was
full of very nice and mostly new clothing for children. It was a
literal fulfilment of the promise, “and it shall come to pass, that
before they call I will answer; and while they are yet speaking
I will hear.” And it is a comforting thought, that wherever God
places us, He gives us the opportunity to answer other people’s
prayers.

The interest in this work is constantly increasing as we know more
about it. The outlook for the year on which we have already entered
is very encouraging. A few days since, while visiting a very hard
neighborhood, one mother who is a church member said, “You must
come around often; we knew ye first, and ye ought to visit us most;
we needs ye too. I allers lays close down to what ye say, like the
knife to the grindstone, ‘cause I wants ye to sharpen me, so I will
get to living better. I’s mighty keerless, tho’ sometimes I does
try in a stamerin’ manner to talk to my trifling neighbors. Now
do come around often and _scrub us up with the Bible_.” Another
woman, who has a good home, said, “We are so glad to have you back,
so we can have our prayer meetings again; for we like those quiet
meetings, without any fuss; and we like a leader in whom we have
confidence, to instruct us.”

One of the pupils in our school urged me to start a Sunday-school
in the Methodist church, of which she is a member. I went three or
four times, accompanied by one of our teachers. The colored pastor
gave us a hearty welcome; said he was proud that we had come to
help, and that he was no respecter of persons. The number increased
each week. Last Sunday it was very unpleasant. The tenacity of the
red Memphis mud was marvelous; but when I arrived, a little late,
at the church, having been detained to attend the burial of a
baby, I found a goodly number, and the pastor was reviewing the
last week’s lesson. We immediately proceeded with the lesson for
the day, after which I told them I thought we had better organize a
Sunday-school, as I only wished to be a teacher, and would rather
some of their own number would be the officers. To this they gladly
assented, and we organized. We have three classes. I furnish them
with Sunday-school papers, as they have never had any. Twice,
as the hour for service approached, the minister has given up
preaching, saying they learned much more studying the Bible. As we
were leaving the church a brother said, “I believe you is going to
be jest the building up of this church.” Another said, “That is the
kind of folks we colored ones needs; some one who is always at the
post of duty, and is not afeard of mud and rain.”

We have substantial evidence that our Northern friends have not
forgotten the suffering ones here, in the shape of two barrels of
very useful clothing, from Whitewater, Wis., and I have word that
boxes from three other places are on the road. May those who give
be as much blessed as those who receive, and we will strive to do
all in our power to answer their prayers. “So we, being many, are
one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.”

STUDENT TEACHERS FROM LE MOYNE.

MISS L. A. PARMELEE, MEMPHIS.

We have never kept any record of the teaching and Sunday-school
work done by our pupils, but, within a few days, I have
gratified my curiosity by taking notes from the lips of a few
student-teachers. Here they are.

Sixteen of our young people have during the summer taught one
thousand and thirty-five (1,035) day pupils, and very nearly as
many S. S. scholars. This does not include the teachers now at
work, some of whom return to us next week, or in early spring.
Probably this is only a fifth of the record, counting all former
pupils.

Some of the experiences are very droll, as of the young woman who
saw new phases of life in Arkansas: “Would you believe it, that the
_white_ people didn’t know as much as I do?” White and black always
called her “the white lady,” and urged her return next season.

Another young woman was assistant in a school of 80 children. The
log school-house had no windows except board shutters; the seats
were boards fastened upon blocks of wood; the blackboard was of her
own manufacture. The building was so small that in pleasant weather
she heard her recitations in a bush-arbor built against the side of
the house.

Some of the teachers had better accommodations. One young man had
an excellent building in a community of thriving farmers. He has
taught there for five seasons. Just now he is getting up a club for
the _New York Tribune_ and reports ten subscribers.

Another young man, a member of the senior class, could scarcely
leave his people. A powerful revival in connection with the school
had brought many aged people as well as children to confess Christ,
and the converts were loth to part with their teacher and friend.
The person who went after him does not weary of telling about the
tears shed and pathetic expressions of regret.

After two years of constant teaching, another writes, “There are so
many things in life I can’t manage, I want to go to school again.”
The most cheering sign of the year is this growing desire for more
thorough preparation for the work of life.

THE INDIANS.

       *       *       *       *       *


BOYS FOR HAMPTON FROM FORT BERTHOLD.

Rev. C. L. Hall, Fort Berthold, D. T.

In the temporary vacancy of this Indian Agency, we gratefully
acknowledge the courtesy of Mr. Hall, who is in the service of the
A. B. C. F. M., in writing us the interesting letter which we print
herewith:

I have had my privilege and my duty to co-operate with your society
as represented by Hampton Institute, Virginia, and with the U. S.
Government, in inducing a number of Indian youth to go East for
education.

We thank God that the Government, among other good movements it has
undertaken, has taken this “new departure” in the matter of Indian
education. The A. B. C. F. M. has for many years been educating
Indians with success, and the present civilized condition of the
Cherokees, Choctaws, and many of the Sioux, Nez Perces and other
tribes, is owing to their efforts, and for some years past the
A. M. A. has also undertaken like work with like success. Indian
education is no new departure with us; but on the part of the
Government it is, and it has given us great pleasure to help on the
plans of the Secretary of the Interior and of Commissioner Hayt in
this matter.

The beginning of their “experiment” was here at Berthold. Captain
Pratt, who was detailed by the Government to get fifty Indians
from the mission, came to start his company at this agency, and I
shall always feel that it was an honor to have been able to help
him get a start. We did not know how the people would feel about
sending their children to a distant and unknown country. They were
superstitious about school and church influences. Would they trust
the white man? Would they be sufficiently influenced by the desire
for an education.

Well, Captain Pratt had both experience and faith; he told us
of his talks and prayer meetings with the prisoners in Florida,
and of their desire for education, and of the willingness of
Eastern Christian friends to help them; then we knelt down in
the sitting-room of our mission home, that Sabbath evening, and
committed our way unto the Lord. All was in doubt; some had refused
to go; the chiefs would not send their children; but soon three
youth (boys of eighteen or twenty years of age) came of their own
accord and offered themselves. They had been attending our school
and had learned in a measure to trust us. They said they knew it
was a long way to go and a long time to stay, and it would be hard;
but they were prepared to carry out their resolution to learn to
be white men. Soon thirteen youth, nine boys and four girls, were
secured, all from our school; it took the nucleus of our school;
but we knew that this movement would create a new interest in
education and bring us new scholars, as well as do more than we
could for the old ones who should go away, so we gave them up
willingly.

With this beginning, Captain Pratt started down the river in a
flat-bottom stern-wheel mission steamboat, one cold October day,
collecting more from the river agencies as he went along till
forty-nine were secured. The youth looked very sober as they
started off; there were some very touching partings with friends,
one of whom said, “I may not see a hair of him again;” and at the
last look at them we saw blankets and coats waving in lieu of
handkerchiefs on the upper deck of the boat. My heart was in my
mouth as I thought of the boys and their Indian relatives, and of
the better days in store for Indians, of which Uncle Sam was giving
us a foretaste. All this was a year ago; to-day a hundred more from
Dakota are on their way to Hampton and to Carlisle, and provision
is being made for others in the West near their own homes. It is a
beginning of better days, and I rejoice that our two Congregational
societies can find occasion to co-operate with each other and the
Government in behalf of the Indian.

Now let us make a vigorous push, along with the forces now at work,
to get him the protection of the U. S. Courts, so that he may have
a better appeal than the only one now open to him, as Gen. Crook
says—_his rifle_.

In spite of the change of agents four times in less than four
years, and in spite of all endeavors to break down Christian
influences here, these Indians have steadily progressed. They are
cultivating more land and doing it more thoroughly, showing more
interest in schools, and a stronger desire to adopt civilized
habits, one young man going so far as to come to me with the
request, “Father, they say you are skilful; can you not make my
shoes squeak for me? They don’t squeak like white people’s shoes.”

THE ROMANCE OF MISSIONS.

BY REV. W. C. POND, SAN FRANCISCO.

It is said that in connection with a somewhat enthusiastic
collection for the American Board, taken ten years or more ago, at
the First Congregational Church in this city, one card was sent up
having this inscription: “Five dollars for Home missions, but ‘nary
red’ for Foreign.” The Christian spirit of the expression and its
rhetorical elegance are about equal. Yet it well represents one
class of Christian workers and givers who believe intensely that
charity begins at home, who like to _see_ what they are doing, and
to watch its on-goings and to judge of its results for themselves.
Foreign missions seem to them chimerical; the interest in such work
romantic; and they don’t believe in romance and chimeras.

We have sometimes met another class whose interest flags when
they are brought in contact with the hard facts of any Christian
work. For them, “’Tis distance lends enchantment to the view.” To
see and handle any Christian enterprise involves them inevitably
in disappointment. They read the glowing pages of the _Herald_,
and often feel their hearts burn within them; but if brought into
actual, daily contact with the toils, the drudgeries of service,
the days of small things, the months and years of discouragement
through which, with faith that would not falter, God led his
servants on to that which now makes those pages glow, they would
soon become disheartened, possibly fault-finding, as though funds
and men were being wasted on a work that makes so little show.

We respectfully suggest to all such friends of our Chinese
work that they remain in the East, and do not at present visit
California; for Christ, as found in the souls for whom we labor,
has no halo round his head—indeed, He had none when He wrought in
that carpenter’s shop at Nazareth; when He walked, with dust-worn
raiment and with weary feet, the ill-wrought trails of ancient
Palestine; nor even when He hung upon the cross. There was no
external beauty to make men desire him; and to many who at this
distance are almost filled with envy at the high privileges Peter,
James and John enjoyed of seeing his face and hearing his voice,
and walking in his companionship, He might have seemed a “root out
of dry ground, having no form nor comeliness.”

At any rate, He abides to-day in souls that are very dark, that are
very little sanctified—saints that by no means answer to the ideal
saintliness—He abides in them; and while with patient love we bear
with them, and while we hope on and work on, though faith feels
like fainting and hope seems long deferred, we are _assured that
we are serving_ HIM. “Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the
least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.”

This is the period of the year when our work has least of what
is outward and visible to stir enthusiasm. The weather is often
stormy. The nights are often very dark. At some of the factories,
work having broken across the boundary line which fading daylight
fixed, holds on under gas-light till it is too late for our pupils
to get to school. At any rate, many of them drop off; the average
declines, and our hearts droop a little. It would be so much
easier to work, if we could all the time be expanding, increasing,
harvesting. Then, often, the pupils seem specially dull, and this
one or that one in whom we have become deeply interested, and whom
we supposed to have become somewhat enlightened, discloses a depth
of darkness which we do not like to fathom, and shows that he has
understood far less than we supposed. Among those whom we believe
to be true followers of Christ, there crop out littlenesses of envy
or jealousy or ill-humor, that perhaps would call down on them
swift condemnation, did not all this remind us so much of what has
stained our own Christian life.

Now if our romantic friends should drop in upon us at such times,
they might be sorely disappointed; might feel that we had drawn on
our fancies for some of our facts; might possibly go away and add
their own “Amen” to the scornful taunts of Godless newspapers upon
“converted Chinamen.” And yet just such experiences of difficulty
and discouragement belong to Christian work everywhere. If they
do not form a necessary part of the discipline and training of
the church, they certainly are unavoidable in the healing of
sin-poisoned souls—in the education, the _leading out_ of men from
darkness into light.

I write these things, not because I have any special
disappointments to communicate. I have none. And yet the state
of the work just now is shadowed in these reflections. I have
sometimes fancied—and felt that it was no mere fancy—that I could
see in the story of our little mission, a tiny miniature of the
history of the Apostolic Church. We had our little Pentecost to
start with. We had the glow of a new love, the effervescence of a
new life, the fresh joy of fraternal fellowship; prayer meetings
carried, against my protest, for sheer delight in them, on into the
small hours, by men who must be up and hard at work by six o’clock
in the morning. Then after awhile we had our Ananias—two of them,
since there was no wife to match Sapphira. And then we had disputes
and little jealousies, like those of the Grecians against the
Hebrews, and our scatterings by persecution and by other causes,
in which, I rejoice to say, our disciples, like those of old, went
here and there, preaching the word; so that with all that there has
been at times to start anxiety, to test faith, to chasten hope, the
work has kept moving on. Souls have been added constantly, _saved_
souls, we trust. Much prayer has gone up to the throne of grace,
and earnest work has followed it, and Christ, thank God, has proved
himself to be stronger than the strong man armed.


THE OROVILLE MISSION.

We entered a new name on the list of our schools on the 1st of
November. It is at Oroville, the county seat of Butte Co. It is
taught by Miss Jessamine Wood, daughter of the Congregational
pastor in that town. Years ago we began a work there, but under
auspices that proved to be very unfavorable. Ever since, we have
desired to renew the effort, but the way has not opened till
now. There are few points in the interior of the State where
so many Chinese—1,500, it is said—are congregated. The Chinese
population of the town at one time out-numbered that of all other
nationalities. Our school, at its outset, is very small, the
attendance being only seven, but we trust it is the thin edge of a
wedge which we may yet drive home with good effect. A helper will
be set at work there, temporarily at least, after the holidays,
by whom not only may the school be enlarged, but the Gospel be

Constitution of the American Missionary Association.

INCORPORATED JANUARY 30, 1849.

       *       *       *       *       *


ART. I. This Society shall be called “THE AMERICAN MISSIONARY
ASSOCIATION.”

ART. II. The object of this Association shall be to conduct
Christian missionary and educational operations, and diffuse a
knowledge of the Holy Scriptures in our own and other countries
which are destitute of them, or which present open and urgent
fields of effort.

ART. III. Any person of evangelical sentiments,[A] who professes
faith in the Lord Jesus Christ who is not a slaveholder, or in the
practice of other immoralities, and who contributes to the funds,
may become a member of the Society; and by the payment of thirty
dollars, a life member; provided that children and others who have
not professed their faith may be constituted life members without
the privilege of voting.

ART. IV. This Society shall meet annually, in the month of
September, October or November, for the election of officers and
the transaction of other business, at such time and place as shall
be designated by the Executive Committee.

ART. V. The annual meeting shall be constituted of the regular
officers and members of the Society at the time of such meeting,
and of delegates from churches, local missionary societies,
and other co-operating bodies, each body being entitled to one
representative.

ART. VI. The officers of the Society shall be a President,
Vice-Presidents, a Recording Secretary, Corresponding Secretaries,
Treasurer, two Auditors, and an Executive Committee of not less
than twelve, of which the Corresponding Secretaries shall be
advisory, and the Treasurer ex-officio, members.

ART. VII. To the Executive Committee shall belong the collecting
and disbursing of funds; the appointing, counselling, sustaining
and dismissing (for just and sufficient reasons) missionaries and
agents; the selection of missionary fields; and, in general, the
transaction of all such business as usually appertains to the
executive committees of missionary and other benevolent societies;
the Committee to exercise no ecclesiastical jurisdiction over the
missionaries; and its doings to be subject always to the revision
of the annual meeting, which shall, by a reference mutually
chosen, always entertain the complaints of any aggrieved agent or
missionary; and the decision of such reference shall be final.

The Executive Committee shall have authority to fill all vacancies
occurring among the officers between the regular annual meetings;
to apply, if they see fit, to any State Legislature for acts of
incorporation; to fix the compensation, where any is given, of all
officers, agents, missionaries, or others in the employment of the
Society; to make provision, if any, for disabled missionaries, and
for the widows and children of such as are deceased; and to call,
in all parts of the country, at their discretion, special and
general conventions of the friends of missions, with a view to the
diffusion of the missionary spirit, and the general and vigorous
promotion of the missionary work.

Five members of the Committee shall constitute a quorum for
transacting business.

ART. VIII. This society, in collecting funds, in appointing
officers, agents and missionaries, and in selecting fields
of labor, and conducting the missionary work, will endeavor
particularly to discountenance slavery, by refusing to receive the
known fruits of unrequited labor, or to welcome to its employment
those who hold their fellow-beings as slaves.

ART. IX. Missionary bodies, churches or individuals agreeing to
the principles of this Society, and wishing to appoint and sustain
missionaries of their own, shall be entitled to do so through the
agency of the Executive Committee, on terms mutually agreed upon.

ART. X. No amendment shall be made to this Constitution without
the concurrence of two-thirds of the members present at a regular
annual meeting; nor unless the proposed amendment has been
submitted to a previous meeting, or to the Executive Committee in
season to be published by them (as it shall be their duty to do, if
so submitted) in the regular official notifications of the meeting.

FOOTNOTE:

[A] By evangelical sentiments, we understand, among others, a
belief in the guilty and lost condition of all men without a
Saviour; the Supreme Deity, Incarnation and Atoning Sacrifice
of Jesus Christ, the only Saviour of the world; the necessity
of regeneration by the Holy Spirit, repentance, faith and holy
obedience in order to salvation; the immortality of the soul; and
the retributions of the judgment in the eternal punishment of the
wicked, and salvation of the righteous.

AIM AND WORK.

To preach the Gospel to the poor. It originated in a sympathy with
the almost friendless slaves. Since Emancipation it has devoted its
main efforts to preparing the FREEDMEN for their duties as citizens
and Christians in America and as missionaries in Africa. As closely
related to this, it seeks to benefit the caste-persecuted CHINESE
in America, and to co-operate with the Government in its humane
and Christian policy towards the INDIANS. It has also a mission in
AFRICA.

WANTS.

1. A steady INCREASE of regular income to keep pace with the
growing work. This increase can only be reached by _regular_ and
_larger_ contributions from the churches—the feeble as well as the
strong.

2. ADDITIONAL BUILDINGS for our higher educational institutions, to
accommodate the increasing numbers of students; MEETING HOUSES for
the new churches we are organizing; MORE MINISTERS, cultured and
pious, for these churches.

3. HELP FOR YOUNG MEN, to be educated as ministers here and
missionaries to Africa—a pressing want.

Before sending boxes, always correspond with the nearest A. M. A.
office, as below:

  NEW YORK      H. W. Hubbard, Esq., 56 Reade Street.

  CHICAGO       Rev. Jas. Powell, 112 West Washington Street.


MAGAZINE.

This Magazine will be sent, gratuitously, if desired, to the
Missionaries of the Association; to Life Members; to all clergymen
who take up collections for the Association; to Superintendents of
Sabbath Schools; to College Libraries; to Theological Seminaries;
to Societies of Inquiry on Missions; and to every donor who does
not prefer to take it as a subscriber, and contributes in a year
not less than five dollars.

Those who wish to remember the AMERICAN MISSIONARY ASSOCIATION in
their last Will and Testament, are earnestly requested to use the
following


FORM OF A BEQUEST.

“I BEQUEATH to my executor (or executors) the sum of —— dollars in
trust, to pay the same in —— days after my decease to the person
who, when the same is payable, shall act as Treasurer of the
‘American Missionary Association’ of New York City, to be applied,
under the direction of the Executive Committee of the Association,
to its charitable uses and purposes.”

The will should be attested by three witnesses [in some States
three are required—in other States only two], who should write
against their names, their places of residence [if in cities,
their street and number]. The following form of attestation will
answer for every State in the Union: “Signed, sealed, published
and declared by the said [A. B.] as his last Will and Testament,
in presence of us, who, at the request of the said A. B., and in
his presence, and in the presence of each other, have hereunto
subscribed our names as witnesses.” In some States it is required
that the Will should be made at least two months before the death
of the testator.

                       THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE.

                 *       *       *       *       *


THE TRIBUNE is conceded by eminent men in this country and Europe
to be “THE LEADING AMERICAN NEWSPAPER.” It is now spending more
labor and money than ever before to deserve that pre-eminence.
It secured and means to retain it by becoming the medium of the
best thought and the voice of the best conscience of the time, by
keeping abreast of _the highest progress_, favoring _the freest
discussion_, hearing all sides, appealing always to _the best
intelligence_ and _the purest morality_, and refusing to cater to
the tastes of the vile or the prejudices of the ignorant.

          _Premiums for 1879-’80.—Extraordinary Offers._

THE TRIBUNE has always dealt liberally with its friends who have
used their time and influence in extending its circulation, but
it now announces a Premium List surpassing in liberality any
heretofore offered by any newspaper. We take pleasure in calling
attention to the following:

                THE LIBRARY OF UNIVERSAL KNOWLEDGE.

Being the last (1879) edition of _Chambers’s Encyclopædia_, a
Dictionary of Universal Knowledge for the People, complete and
Unabridged, with large additions upon topics of special interest to
American readers, in twenty volumes, the first fourteen comprising
the exact and entire text of Chambers’s Encyclopædia, omitting only
the cuts, and the last six containing several thousand topics not
found in the original work, besides additional treatment of many
there presented. This portion is designed to meet the special wants
of American readers, supplying the natural deficiencies of the
English work.

The twenty volumes will actually contain _over 12 per cent. more
matter than Appleton’s Cyclopædia_, which sells at _eighty dollars_!

Two of the volumes are now ready for delivery, the third is in
press and will be ready in a few days, and then they will be issued
at the rate of two volumes per month until the entire twenty
volumes are completed, which will be about August or September,
1880.

We offer this valuable work on the following terms:

  =For $12.=—THE LIBRARY OF UNIVERSAL KNOWLEDGE, 20 vols.,
  substantially bound in cloth, and THE WEEKLY TRIBUNE 5 years to
  one subscriber.

  =For $18.=—THE LIBRARY OF UNIVERSAL KNOWLEDGE, 20 vols., as
  above, and the SEMI-WEEKLY TRIBUNE 5 years.

  =For $18.=—THE LIBRARY OF UNIVERSAL KNOWLEDGE, 20 vols., as
  above, and ten copies of THE WEEKLY TRIBUNE one year.

  =For $27.=—THE LIBRARY OF UNIVERSAL KNOWLEDGE, 20 vols., as
  above, and twenty copies of THE WEEKLY TRIBUNE one year.

  =For $26.=—THE LIBRARY OF UNIVERSAL KNOWLEDGE, 20 vols., as
  above, and THE DAILY TRIBUNE 2 years.

The books will in all cases be sent by mail, express or otherwise
as the subscriber may direct, at his expense, but with no charge
for packing. We shall begin sending them in the order in which
subscriptions have been received on the 1st of January, 1880, when
certainly five and probably six volumes will be ready, and shall
send thenceforward as subscribers may direct.

                       A MAGNIFICENT GIFT!

           Worcester’s Great Unabridged Dictionary Free!

THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE will send at the subscriber’s expense for
freight, or deliver in New York City free, Worcester’s Great
Unabridged Quarto Illustrated Dictionary, bound in sheep, =edition
of 1879=, the very latest and very best edition of that great work,
to any one remitting:

  =$10= for a single five-years’ subscription in advance, or five
  one-year subscriptions to THE WEEKLY; or

  =$15= for a single five-years’ subscription in advance, or
  five one-year subscriptions to THE SEMI-WEEKLY, or one year’s
  subscription to THE DAILY; or

  =$30= for a single three-years’ subscription to THE DAILY TRIBUNE.

=For One Dollar= extra the Dictionary can be sent by mail to any
part of the United States.

              Terms of the Tribune, without Premiums.

                POSTAGE FREE IN THE UNITED STATES.

  DAILY TRIBUNE, 1 year              $10.00
  SEMI-WEEKLY TRIBUNE 1 year           3.00
    Five Copies, 1 year, each          2.50
    Ten Copies, 1 year, each           2.00
  And 1 free copy for every 10 subscribers.

  THE WEEKLY TRIBUNE:
    Single Copy, 1 year               $2.00
    Five Copies, 1 year, each          1.50
    Ten Copies, 1 year, each           1.00
  And 1 free copy for every 10 subscribers.

When the fact is considered that THE WEEKLY TRIBUNE, both in the
quantity and the quality of its reading matter, is the equal of any
and the superior of most of the $3 and $4 literary and religious
papers, and that the SEMI-WEEKLY contains twice as much reading
matter every week as THE WEEKLY, this reduction in price is one of
the most notable instances of journalistic enterprise.

Remittances should be made by Draft on New York, Post Office Order,
or in Registered Letter. Address

THE THIRTY-FOURTH VOLUME

OF THE

American Missionary,

1880.


We have been gratified with the constant tokens of the increasing
appreciation of the MISSIONARY during the past year, and purpose to
spare no effort to make its pages of still greater value to those
interested in the work which it records.

Shall we not have a largely increased subscription list for 1880?

A little effort on the part of our friends, when making their own
remittances, to induce their neighbors to unite in forming Clubs,
will easily double our list, and thus widen the influence of our
Magazine, and aid in the enlargement of our work.

Under the editorial supervision of Rev. GEO. M. BOYNTON, aided
by the steady contributions of our intelligent missionaries
and teachers in all parts of the field, and with occasional
communications from careful observers and thinkers elsewhere,
the AMERICAN MISSIONARY furnishes a vivid and reliable picture
of the work going forward among the Indians, the Chinamen on the
Pacific Coast, and the Freedmen as citizens in the South and as
missionaries in Africa.

It will be the vehicle of important views on all matters affecting
the races among which it labors, and will give a monthly summary of
current events relating to their welfare and progress.

Patriots and Christians interested in the education and
Christianizing of these despised races are asked to read it, and
assist in its circulation. Begin with the next number and the new
year. The price is only Fifty Cents per annum.

The Magazine will be sent gratuitously, if preferred, to the
persons indicated on page 62.

Donations and subscriptions should be sent to

                             H. W. HUBBARD, Treasurer,
                                        56 Reade Street, New York.

       *       *       *       *       *

TO ADVERTISERS.

Special attention is invited to the advertising department of the
AMERICAN MISSIONARY. Among its regular readers are thousands of
Ministers of the Gospel, Presidents, Professors and Teachers in
Colleges, Theological Seminaries and Schools; it is, therefore,
a specially valuable medium for advertising Books, Periodicals,
Newspapers, Maps, Charts, Institutions of Learning, Church
Furniture, Bells, Household Goods, &c.

Advertisers are requested to note the moderate price charged for
space in its columns, considering the extent and character of its
circulation.

Advertisements must be received by the TENTH of the month, in order
to secure insertion in the following number. All communications in
relation to advertising should be addressed to

          THE AMERICAN MISSIONARY ADVERTISING DEPARTMENT,
                                         56 Reade Street, New York.

       *       *       *       *       *

☞ Our friends who are interested in the Advertising Department of
the “American Missionary” can aid us in this respect by mentioning,
when ordering goods, that they saw them advertised in our Magazine.

       *       *       *       *       *

Transcriber’s Notes:


Ditto marks in tables were replaced by the text they represent in order
to facilitate alignment for eBooks.

Page number in the Contents for The Romance of Missions corrected from
53 to 54.

Spelling and punctuation were changed only where the error appears
to be a printing error. The punctuation changes are too numerous to
list; the others are as follows:

Extra “Mr.” removed from page 10 (Mr. F. C. Briggs).

Changed “Aegncy” to “Agency” on page 53 (this Indian Agency).

Changed “S’kokmish” to “S’kokomish” on page 60 in the Washington
Ter. section.

Changed “it” to “at” on page 62 (at least two months).

Changed “libeally” to “liberally” (dealt liberally with its friends)

Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily

same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at www.gutenberg.org. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:

    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

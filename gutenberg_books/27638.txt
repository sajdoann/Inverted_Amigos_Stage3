Notes and Definitions


In addition to the updating of information, the following changes have
been made in this edition of The World Factbook. The entity of Serbia
and Montenegro is now officially known as Yugoslavia.  There are new
entries on:  Currency code, HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate, HIV/AIDS
- deaths, HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS, Internet users, and
Internet country code.  The Background entry, which was introduced in
the 1999 edition, has now been completed for all 267 entities in the
Factbook.  The individual country maps are being revised.  Some new
maps with elevation extremes and a partial geographic grid are included
in this edition.


Abbreviations
This information is included in Appendix A: Abbreviations, which
includes all abbreviations and acronyms used in the Factbook, with
their expansions.

Acronyms
An acronym is an abbreviation coined from the initial letter of each
successive word in a term or phrase.  In general, an acronym made up
solely from the first letter of the major words in the expanded form is
rendered in all capital letters (NATO from North Atlantic Treaty
Organization; an exception would be ASEAN for Association of Southeast
Asian Nations).  In general, an acronym made up of more than the first
letter of the major words in the expanded form is rendered with only an
initial capital letter (Comsat from Communications Satellite
Corporation; an exception would be NAM from Nonaligned Movement).
Hybrid forms are sometimes used to distinguish between initially
identical terms (WTO:  WTrO for World Trade Organization and WToO for
World Tourism Organization.)

Administrative divisions
This entry generally gives the numbers, designatory terms, and first-
order administrative divisions as approved by the US Board on
Geographic Names (BGN). Changes that have been reported but not yet
acted on by BGN are noted.

Age structure
This entry provides the distribution of the population according to
age. Information is included by sex and age group (0-14 years, 15-64
years, 65 years and over). The age structure of a population affects a
nation's key socioeconomic issues. Countries with young populations
(high percentage under age 15) need to invest more in schools, while
countries with older populations (high percentage ages 65 and over)
need to invest more in the health sector. The age structure can also be
used to help predict potential political issues. For example, the rapid
growth of a young adult population unable to find employment can lead
to unrest.

Agriculture - products
This entry is a rank ordering of major crops and products starting with
the most important.

Airports
This entry gives the total number of airports. The runway(s) may be
paved (concrete or asphalt surfaces) or unpaved (grass, dirt, sand, or
gravel surfaces), but must be usable. Not all airports have facilities
for refueling, maintenance, or air traffic control.

Airports - with paved runways
This entry gives the total number of airports with paved runways
(concrete or asphalt surfaces). For airports with more than one runway,
only the longest runway is included according to the following five
groups - (1) over 3,047 m, (2) 2,438 to 3,047 m, (3) 1,524 to 2,437 m,
(4) 914 to 1,523 m, and (5) under 914 m. Only airports with usable
runways are included in this listing. Not all airports have facilities
for refueling, maintenance, or air traffic control.

Airports - with unpaved runways
This entry gives the total number of airports with unpaved runways
(grass, dirt, sand, or gravel surfaces). For airports with more than
one runway, only the longest runway is included according to the
following five groups - (1) over 3,047 m, (2) 2,438 to 3,047 m, (3)
1,524 to 2,437 m, (4) 914 to 1,523 m, and (5) under 914 m. Only
airports with usable runways are included in this listing. Not all
airports have facilities for refueling, maintenance, or air traffic
control

Appendixes
This section includes Factbook-related material by topic.

Area
This entry includes three subfields. Total area is the sum of all land
and water areas delimited by international boundaries and/or
coastlines. Land area is the aggregate of all surfaces delimited by
international boundaries and/or coastlines, excluding inland water
bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers). Water area is the sum of all water
surfaces delimited by international boundaries and/or coastlines,
including inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers).

Area - comparative
This entry provides an area comparison based on total area equivalents.
Most entities are compared with the entire US or one of the 50 states
based on area measurements (1990 revised) provided by the US Bureau of
the Census. The smaller entities are compared with Washington, DC (178
sq km, 69 sq mi) or The Mall in Washington, DC (0.59 sq km, 0.23 sq mi,
146 acres).

Background
This entry usually highlights major historic events and current issues
and may include a statement about one or two key future trends.

Birth rate
This entry gives the average annual number of births during a year per
1,000 persons in the population at midyear; also known as crude birth
rate. The birth rate is usually the dominant factor in determining the
rate of population growth. It depends on both the level of fertility
and the age structure of the population.

Budget
This entry includes revenues, total expenditures, and capital
expenditures.  These figures are calculated on an exchange rate basis,
i.e., not in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms

Capital
This entry gives the location of the seat of government.

Climate
This entry includes a brief description of typical weather regimes
throughout the year.

Coastline
This entry gives the total length of the boundary between the land area
(including islands) and the sea.

Communications
This category deals with the means of exchanging information and
includes the telephone, radio, television, and Internet service
provider entries.

Communications - note
This entry includes miscellaneous communications information of
significance not included elsewhere.

Constitution
This entry includes the dates of adoption, revisions, and major
amendments.

Country data codes
see Data codes

Country map
Most versions of the Factbook provide a country map in color. The maps
were produced from the best information available at the time of
preparation. Names and/or boundaries may have changed subsequently.

Country name
This entry includes all forms of the country's name approved by the US
Board on Geographic Names (Italy is used as an example): conventional
long form (Italian Republic), conventional short form (Italy), local
long form (Repubblica Italiana), local short form (Italia), former
(Kingdom of Italy), as well as the abbreviation. Also see the
Terminology note.

Currency
This entry identifies the national medium of exchange and its basic
subunit.

Currency code
This entry gives the International Organization for Standardization
(ISO) 4217 alphabetic currency code for each country.

Data codes
This information is presented in Appendix D:  Cross-Reference List of
Country Data Codes and Appendix E:  Cross-Reference List of
Hydrographic Data Codes.  This appendix includes the US Government
approved Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) codes, the
International Organization for Standardization (ISO) codes, and
Internet codes for land entities.  The appendix also includes the
International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) codes, Aeronautical Chart
and Information Center (ACIC; now a part of the National Imagery and
Mapping Agency or NIMA) codes, and Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA)
codes for hydrographic entities. The US Government has not yet approved
a standard for hydrographic data codes similar to the FIPS 10-4
standard for country data codes.

Date of information
In general, information available as of 1 January 2001, was used in the
preparation of this edition.

Death rate
This entry gives the average annual number of deaths during a year per
1,000 population at midyear; also known as crude death rate. The death
rate, while only a rough indicator of the mortality situation in a
country, accurately indicates the current mortality impact on
population growth. This indicator is significantly affected by age
distribution, and most countries will eventually show a rise in the
overall death rate, in spite of continued decline in mortality at all
ages, as declining fertility results in an aging population.

Debt - external
This entry gives the total amount of public foreign financial
obligations.

Dependency status
This entry describes the formal relationship between a particular
nonindependent entity and an independent state.

Dependent areas
This entry contains an alphabetical listing of all nonindependent
entities associated in some way with a particular independent state.

Diplomatic representation
The US Government has diplomatic relations with 185 independent states,
including 183 of the 189 UN members (excluded UN members are Bhutan,
Cuba, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, and the US itself). In addition, the US
has diplomatic relations with 2 independent states that are not in the
UN - Holy See and Switzerland.

Diplomatic representation from the US
This entry includes the chief of mission, embassy address, mailing
address, telephone number, FAX number, branch office locations,
consulate general locations, and consulate locations.

Disputes - international
This entry includes a wide variety of situations that range from
traditional bilateral boundary disputes to unilateral claims of one
sort or another. Information regarding disputes over international
terrestrial and maritime boundaries has been reviewed by the US
Department of State. References to other situations involving borders
or frontiers may also be included, such as resource disputes,
geopolitical questions, or irredentist issues; however, inclusion does
not necessarily constitute official acceptance or recognition by the US
Government.

Economic aid - donor
This entry refers to net official development assistance (ODA) from
OECD nations to developing countries and multilateral organizations.
ODA is defined as financial assistance that is concessional in
character, has the main objective to promote economic development and
welfare of the less developed countries (LDCs), and contains a grant
element of at least 25%. The entry does not cover other official flows
(OOF) or private flows.

Economic aid - recipient
This entry, which is subject to major problems of definition and
statistical coverage, refers to the net inflow of Official Development
Finance (ODF) to recipient countries. The figure includes assistance
from the World Bank, the IMF, and other international organizations and
from individual nation donors. Formal commitments of aid are included
in the data. Omitted from the data are grants by private organizations.
Aid comes in various forms including outright grants and loans. The
entry thus is the difference between new inflows and repayments.

Economy
This category includes the entries dealing with the size, development,
and management of productive resources, i.e., land, labor, and capital.

Economy - overview
This entry briefly describes the type of economy, including the degree
of market orientation, the level of economic development, the most
important natural resources, and the unique areas of specialization. It
also characterizes major economic events and policy changes in the most
recent 12 months and may include a statement about one or two key
future macroeconomic trends.

Electricity - consumption
This entry consists of total electricity generated annually plus
imports and minus exports, expressed in kilowatt-hours. The discrepancy
between the amount of electricity generated and/or imported and the
amount consumed and/or exported is accounted for as loss in
transmission and distribution.

Electricity - exports
This entry is the total exported electricity in kilowatt-hours.

Electricity - imports
This entry is the total imported electricity in kilowatt-hours.

Electricity - production
This entry is the annual electricity generated expressed in kilowatt-
hours. The discrepancy between the amount of electricity generated
and/or imported and the amount consumed and/or exported is accounted
for as loss in transmission and distribution.

Electricity - production by source
This entry indicates the percentage share of annual electricity
production of each energy source. These are fossil fuel, hydro,
nuclear, and other (solar, geothermal, and wind).

Elevation extremes
This entry includes both the highest point and the lowest point.

Entities
Some of the independent states, dependencies, areas of special
sovereignty, and governments included in this publication are not
independent, and others are not officially recognized by the US
Government. "Independent state" refers to a people politically
organized into a sovereign state with a definite territory.
"Dependencies" and "areas of special sovereignty" refer to a broad
category of political entities that are associated in some way with an
independent state. "Country" names used in the table of contents or for
page headings are usually the short-form names as approved by the US
Board on Geographic Names and may include independent states,
dependencies, and areas of special sovereignty, or other geographic
entities. There are a total of 267 separate geographic entities in The
World Factbook that may be categorized as follows:

Environment - current issues
This entry lists the most pressing and important environmental
problems.  The following terms and abbreviations are used throughout
the entry:

     acidification - the lowering of soil and water pH due to acid
precipitation and deposition usually through precipitation; this
process disrupts ecosystem nutrient flows and may kill freshwater fish
and plants dependent on more neutral or alkaline conditions (see acid
rain).

     acid rain - characterized as containing harmful levels of sulfur
dioxide or nitrogen oxide; acid rain is damaging and potentially deadly
to the earth's fragile ecosystems; acidity is measured using the pH
scale where 7 is neutral, values greater than 7 are considered
alkaline, and values below 5.6 are considered acid precipitation; note
- a pH of 2.4 (the acidity of vinegar) has been measured in rainfall in
New England.

     aerosol - a collection of airborne particles dispersed in a gas,
smoke, or fog.

     afforestation - converting a bare or agricultural space by
planting trees and plants; reforestation involves replanting trees on
areas that have been cut or destroyed by fire.

     asbestos - a naturally occurring soft fibrous mineral commonly
used in fireproofing materials and considered to be highly carcinogenic
in particulate form.

     biodiversity - also biological diversity; the relative number of
species, diverse in form and function, at the genetic, organism,
community, and ecosystem level; loss of biodiversity reduces an
ecosystem's ability to recover from natural or man-induced disruption.

     bio-indicators - a plant or animal species whose presence,
abundance, and health reveal the general condition of its habitat.

     biomass - the total weight or volume of living matter in a given
area or volume.

     carbon cycle - the term used to describe the exchange of carbon
(in various forms, e.g., as carbon dioxide) between the atmosphere,
ocean, terrestrial biosphere, and geological deposits.

     catchments - assemblages used to capture and retain rainwater and
runoff; an important water management technique in areas with limited
freshwater resources, such as Gibraltar.

     DDT (dichloro-diphenyl-trichloro-ethane) - a colorless, odorless
insecticide that has toxic effects on most animals; the use of DDT was
banned in the US in 1972.

     defoliants - chemicals which cause plants to lose their leaves
artificially; often used in agricultural practices for weed control,
and may have detrimental impacts on human and ecosystem health.

     deforestation - the destruction of vast areas of forest (e.g.,
unsustainable forestry practices, agricultural and range land clearing,
and the over exploitation of wood products for use as fuel) without
planting new growth.

     desertification - the spread of desert-like conditions in arid or
semi-arid areas, due to overgrazing, loss of agriculturally productive
soils, or climate change.

     dredging - the practice of deepening an existing waterway; also, a
technique used for collecting bottom-dwelling marine organisms (e.g.,
shellfish) or harvesting coral, often causing significant destruction
of reef and ocean-floor ecosystems.

     drift-net fishing - done with a net, miles in extent, that is
generally anchored to a boat and left to float with the tide; often
results in an over harvesting and waste of large populations of non-
commercial marine species (by-catch) by its effect of "sweeping the
ocean clean".

     ecosystems - ecological units comprised of complex communities of
organisms and their specific environments.

     effluents - waste materials, such as smoke, sewage, or industrial
waste which are released into the environment, subsequently polluting
it.

     endangered species - a species that is threatened with extinction
either by direct hunting or habitat destruction.

     freshwater - water with very low soluble mineral content; sources
include lakes, streams, rivers, glaciers, and underground aquifers.

     greenhouse gas - a gas that "traps" infrared radiation in the
lower atmosphere causing surface warming; water vapor, carbon dioxide,
nitrous oxide, methane, hydrofluorocarbons, and ozone are the primary
greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere.

     groundwater - water sources found below the surface of the earth
often in naturally occurring reservoirs in permeable rock strata; the
source for wells and natural springs.

     Highlands Water Project - a series of dams constructed jointly by
Lesotho and South Africa to redirect Lesotho's abundant water supply
into a rapidly growing area in South Africa; while it is the largest
infrastructure project in southern Africa, it is also the most costly
and controversial; objections to the project include claims that it
forces people from their homes, submerges farmlands, and squanders
economic resources.

     Inuit Circumpolar Conference (ICC) - represents the 125,000 Inuits
of Russia, Alaska, Canada, and Greenland in international environmental
issues; a panel convenes every three years to determine the focus of
the ICC; the most current concerns are long-range transport of
pollutants, sustainable development, and climate change.

     metallurgical plants - industries which specialize in the science,
technology, and processing of metals; these plants produce highly
concentrated and toxic wastes which can contribute to pollution of
ground water and air when not properly disposed.

     noxious substances - injurious, very harmful to living beings.

     overgrazing - the grazing of animals on plant material faster than
it can naturally regrow leading to the permanent loss of plant cover, a
common effect of too many animals grazing limited range land.

     ozone shield - a layer of the atmosphere composed of ozone gas (O3)
that resides approximately 25 miles above the Earth's surface and
absorbs solar ultraviolet radiation that can be harmful to living
organisms.

     poaching - the illegal killing of animals or fish, a great concern
with respect to endangered or threatened species.

     pollution - the contamination of a healthy environment by man-made
waste.

     potable water - water that is drinkable, safe to be consumed.

     salination - the process through which fresh (drinkable) water
becomes salt (undrinkable) water; hence, desalination is the reverse
process; also involves the accumulation of salts in topsoil caused by
evaporation of excessive irrigation water, a process that can
eventually render soil incapable of supporting crops.

     siltation - occurs when water channels and reservoirs become
clotted with silt and mud, a side effect of deforestation and soil
erosion.

     slash-and-burn agriculture - a rotating cultivation technique in
which trees are cut down and burned in order to clear land for
temporary agriculture; the land is used until its productivity declines
at which point a new plot is selected and the process repeats; this
practice is sustainable while population levels are low and time is
permitted for regrowth of natural vegetation; conversely, where these
conditions do not exist, the practice can have disastrous consequences
for the environment .

     soil degradation - damage to the land's productive capacity
because of poor agricultural practices such as the excessive use of
pesticides or fertilizers, soil compaction from heavy equipment, or
erosion of topsoil, eventually resulting in reduced ability to produce
agricultural products.

     soil erosion - the removal of soil by the action of water or wind,
compounded by poor agricultural practices, deforestation, overgrazing,
and desertification.

     ultraviolet (UV) radiation - a portion of the electromagnetic
energy emitted by the sun and naturally filtered in the upper
atmosphere by the ozone layer; UV radiation can be harmful to living
organisms and has been linked to increasing rates of skin cancer in
humans.

     water-born diseases - those in which the bacteria survive in, and
is transmitted through, water; always a serious threat in areas with an
untreated water supply.

Environment - international agreements
This entry separates country participation in international
environmental agreements into two levels - party to and signed but not
ratified. Agreements are listed in alphabetical order by the
abbreviated form of the full name.

Environmental agreements
This information is presented in Appendix C: Selected International
Environmental Agreements, which includes the name, abbreviation, date
opened for signature, date entered into force, objective, and parties
by category.

Ethnic groups
This entry provides a rank ordering of ethnic groups starting with the
largest and normally includes the percent of total population.

Exchange rates
This entry provides the official value of a country's monetary unit at
a given date or over a given period of time, as expressed in units of
local currency per US dollar and as determined by international market
forces or official fiat.

Executive branch
This entry includes several subfields. Chief of state includes the name
and title of the titular leader of the country who represents the state
at official and ceremonial functions but may not be involved with the
day-to-day activities of the government. Head of government includes
the name and title of the top administrative leader who is designated
to manage the day-to-day activities of the government. For example, in
the UK, the monarch is the chief of state, and the prime minister is
the head of government. In the US, the president is both the chief of
state and the head of government. Cabinet includes the official name
for this body of high-ranking advisers and the method for selection of
members. Elections includes the nature of election process or accession
to power, date of the last election, and date of the next election.
Election results includes the percent of vote for each candidate in the
last election.

Exports
This entry provides the total US dollar amount of exports on an f.o.b.
(free on board) basis.

Exports - commodities
This entry provides a rank ordering of exported products starting with
the most important; it sometimes includes the percent of total dollar
value.

Exports - partners
This entry provides a rank ordering of trading partners starting with
the most important; it sometimes includes the percent of total dollar
value.

Fiscal year
This entry identifies the beginning and ending months for a country's
accounting period of 12 months, which often is the calendar year but
which may begin in any month. All yearly references are for the
calendar year (CY) unless indicated as a noncalendar fiscal year (FY).

Flag description
This entry provides a written flag description produced from actual
flags or the best information available at the time the entry was
written. The flags of independent states are used by their dependencies
unless there is an officially recognized local flag. Some disputed and
other areas do not have flags.

Flag graphic
Most versions of the Factbook include a color flag at the beginning of
the country profile. The flag graphics were produced from actual flags
or the best information available at the time of preparation. The flags
of independent states are used by their dependencies unless there is an
officially recognized local flag. Some disputed and other areas do not
have flags.

GDP
This entry gives the gross domestic product (GDP) or value of all final
goods and services produced within a nation in a given year. GDP dollar
estimates in the Factbook are derived from purchasing power parity
(PPP) calculations. See the note on GDP methodology for more
information.

GDP methodology
In the Economy section, GDP dollar estimates for all countries are
derived from purchasing power parity (PPP) calculations rather than
from conversions at official currency exchange rates. The PPP method
involves the use of standardized international dollar price weights,
which are applied to the quantities of final goods and services
produced in a given economy.  The data derived from the PPP method
provide the best available starting point for comparisons of economic
strength and well-being between countries.  The division of a GDP
estimate in domestic currency by the corresponding PPP estimate in
dollars gives the PPP conversion rate.  Whereas PPP estimates for OECD
countries are quite reliable, PPP estimates for developing countries
are often rough approximations.  Most of the GDP estimates are based on
extrapolation of PPP numbers published by the UN International
Comparison Program (UNICP) and by Professors Robert Summers and Alan
Heston of the University of Pennsylvania and their colleagues. In
contrast, the currency exchange rate method involves a variety of
international and domestic financial forces that often have little
relation to domestic output. In developing countries with weak
currencies the exchange rate estimate of GDP in dollars is typically
one-fourth to one-half the PPP estimate. Furthermore, exchange rates
may suddenly go up or down by 10% or more because of market forces or
official fiat whereas real output has remained unchanged. On 12 January
1994, for example, the 14 countries of the African Financial Community
(whose currencies are tied to the French franc) devalued their
currencies by 50%. This move, of course, did not cut the real output of
these countries by half. One important caution:  the proportion of,
say, defense expenditures as a percentage of GDP in local currency
accounts may differ substantially from the proportion when GDP accounts
are expressed in PPP terms, as, for example, when an observer tries to
estimate the dollar level of Russian or Japanese military expenditures.
Note: the numbers for GDP and other economic data can not be chained
together from successive volumes of the Factbook because of changes in
the US dollar measuring rod, revisions of data by statistical agencies,
use of new or different sources of information, and changes in national
statistical methods and practices.

GDP - composition by sector
This entry gives the percentage contribution of agriculture, industry,
and services to total GDP.

GDP - per capita
This entry shows GDP on a purchasing power parity basis divided by
population as of 1 July for the same year.

GDP - real growth rate
This entry gives GDP growth on an annual basis adjusted for inflation
and expressed as a percent.

Geographic coordinates
This entry includes rounded latitude and longitude figures for the
purpose of finding the approximate geographic center of an entity and
is based on the Gazetteer of Conventional Names, Third Edition, August
1988, US Board on Geographic Names and on other sources.

Geographic names
This information is presented in Appendix F: Cross-Reference List of
Geographic Names.  It includes a listing of various alternate names,
former names, local names, and regional names referenced to one or more
related Factbook entries. Spellings are normally, but not always, those
approved by the US Board on Geographic Names (BGN). Alternate names and
additional information are included in parentheses.

Geography
This category includes the entries dealing with the natural environment
and the effects of human activity.

Geography - note
This entry includes miscellaneous geographic information of
significance not included elsewhere.

GNP
Gross national product (GNP) is the value of all final goods and
services produced within a nation in a given year, plus income earned
by its citizens abroad, minus income earned by foreigners from domestic
production. The Factbook, following current practice, uses GDP rather
than GNP to measure national production. However, the user must realize
that in certain countries net remittances from citizens working abroad
may be important to national well-being.

Government
This category includes the entries dealing with the system for the
adoption and administration of public policy.

Government type
This entry gives the basic form of government (e.g., republic,
constitutional monarchy, federal republic, parliamentary democracy,
military dictatorship).

Government - note
This entry includes miscellaneous government information of
significance not included elsewhere.

Gross domestic product
see GDP

Gross national product
see GNP

Gross world product
see GWP

GWP
This entry gives the gross world product (GWP) or aggregate value of
all final goods and services produced worldwide in a given year.

Heliports
This entry gives the total number of established helicopter takeoff and
landing sites (which may or may not have fuel or other services).

Highways
This entry includes the total length of the highway system as well as
the length of the paved and unpaved components.

HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate
This entry gives an estimate of the percentage of adults (aged 15-49)
living with HIV/AIDS. The adult prevalence rate is calculated by
dividing the estimated number of adults living with HIV/AIDS at yearend
by the total adult population at yearend.

HIV/AIDS - deaths
This entry gives an estimate of the number of adults and children who
died of AIDS during a given calendar year.

HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS
This entry gives an estimate of all people (adults and children) alive
at yearend with HIV infection, whether or not they have developed
symptoms of AIDS.

Household income or consumption by percentage share
Data on household income or consumption come from household surveys,
the results adjusted for household size. Nations use different
standards and procedures in collecting and adjusting the data. Surveys
based on income will normally show a more unequal distribution than
surveys based on consumption. The quality of surveys is improving with
time, yet caution is still necessary in making inter-country
comparisons.

Hydrographic data codes

Illicit drugs
This entry gives information on the five categories of illicit drugs -
narcotics, stimulants, depressants (sedatives), hallucinogens, and
cannabis. These categories include many drugs legally produced and
prescribed by doctors as well as those illegally produced and sold
outside of medical channels.

     Cannabis (Cannabis sativa) is the common hemp plant, which
provides hallucinogens with some sedative properties, and includes
marijuana (pot, Acapulco gold, grass, reefer), tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC, Marinol), hashish (hash), and hashish oil (hash oil).

     Coca (mostly Erythroxylum coca) is a bush with leaves that contain
the stimulant used to make cocaine. Coca is not to be confused with
cocoa, which comes from cacao seeds and is used in making chocolate,
cocoa, and cocoa butter.

     Cocaine is a stimulant derived from the leaves of the coca bush.

     Depressants (sedatives) are drugs that reduce tension and anxiety
and include chloral hydrate, barbiturates (Amytal, Nembutal, Seconal,
phenobarbital), benzodiazepines (Librium, Valium), methaqualone
(Quaalude), glutethimide (Doriden), and others (Equanil, Placidyl,
Valmid).

     Drugs are any chemical substances that effect a physical, mental,
emotional, or behavioral change in an individual.

     Drug abuse is the use of any licit or illicit chemical substance
that results in physical, mental, emotional, or behavioral impairment
in an individual.

     Hallucinogens are drugs that affect sensation, thinking, self-
awareness, and emotion. Hallucinogens include LSD (acid, microdot),
mescaline and peyote (mexc, buttons, cactus), amphetamine variants
(PMA, STP, DOB), phencyclidine (PCP, angel dust, hog), phencyclidine
analogues (PCE, PCPy, TCP), and others (psilocybin, psilocyn).

     Hashish is the resinous exudate of the cannabis or hemp plant
(Cannabis sativa).

     Heroin is a semisynthetic derivative of morphine.

     Mandrax is a trade name for methaqualone, a pharmaceutical
depressant.

     Marijuana is the dried leaf of the cannabis or hemp plant
(Cannabis sativa).

     Methaqualone is a pharmaceutical depressant, referred to as
mandrax in Southwest Asia and Africa.

     Narcotics are drugs that relieve pain, often induce sleep, and
refer to opium, opium derivatives, and synthetic substitutes. Natural
narcotics include opium (paregoric, parepectolin), morphine (MS-Contin,
Roxanol), codeine (Tylenol with codeine, Empirin with codeine,
Robitussan AC), and thebaine. Semisynthetic narcotics include heroin
(horse, smack), and hydromorphone (Dilaudid). Synthetic narcotics
include meperidine or Pethidine (Demerol, Mepergan), methadone
(Dolophine, Methadose), and others (Darvon, Lomotil).

     Opium is the brown, gummy exudate of the incised, unripe seedpod
of the opium poppy.

     Opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) is the source for the natural and
semisynthetic narcotics.

     Poppy straw concentrate is the alkaloid derived from the mature,
dried opium poppy.

     Qat (kat, khat) is a stimulant from the buds or leaves of Catha
edulis that is chewed or drunk as tea.

     Quaaludes is the North American slang term for methaqualone, a
pharmaceutical depressant.

     Stimulants are drugs that relieve mild depression, increase energy
and activity, and include cocaine (coke, snow, crack), amphetamines
(Desoxyn, Dexedrine), ephedrine, ecstasy (clarity, essence, doctor,
Adam), phenmetrazine (Preludin), methylphenidate (Ritalin), and others
(Cylert, Sanorex, Tenuate).

Imports
This entry provides the total US dollar amount of imports on a c.i.f.
(cost, insurance, and freight) or f.o.b. (free on board) basis.

Imports - commodities
This entry provides a rank ordering of imported products starting with
the most important; it sometimes includes the percent of total dollar
value.

Imports - partners
This entry provides a rank ordering of trading partners starting with
the most important; it sometimes includes the percent of total dollar
value.

Independence
For most countries, this entry gives the date that sovereignty was
achieved and from which nation, empire, or trusteeship. For the other
countries, the date given may not represent "independence" in the
strict sense, but rather some significant nationhood event such as the
traditional founding date or the date of unification, federation,
confederation, establishment, fundamental change in the form of
government, or state succession. Dependent areas include the notation
"none" followed by the nature of their dependency status. Also see the
Terminology note.

Industrial production growth rate
This entry gives the annual percentage increase in industrial
production (includes manufacturing, mining, and construction).

Industries
This entry provides a rank ordering of industries starting with the
largest by value of annual output.

Infant mortality rate
This entry gives the number of deaths of infants under one year old in
a given year per 1,000 live births in the same year. This rate is often
used as an indicator of the level of health in a country.

Inflation rate (consumer prices)
This entry furnishes the annual percent change in consumer prices
compared with the previous year's consumer prices.

Internet country code
This entry includes the two-letter codes maintained by the
International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in the ISO 3166
Alpha-2 list and used by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
to establish country-coded top-level domains (ccTLDs).

Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
This entry supplies the number of Internet Service Providers within a
country. An ISP is defined as a company that provides access to the
Internet.

Internet users
This entry gives the number of users within a country that access the
Internet.  Statistics vary from country to country and may include
users who access the Internet at least several times a week to those
who access it only once within a period of several months.

International disputes
see Disputes - international

International organization participation
This entry lists in alphabetical order by abbreviation those
international organizations in which the subject country is a member or
participates in some other way.

International organizations
This information is presented in Appendix B: International
Organizations and Groups which includes the name, abbreviation, date
established, aim, and members by category.

Introduction
This category includes one entry, Background.

Irrigated land
This entry gives the number of square kilometers of land area that is
artificially supplied with water.

Judicial branch
This entry contains the name(s) of the highest court(s) and a brief
description of the selection process for members.

Labor force
This entry contains the total labor force figure.

Labor force - by occupation
This entry contains a rank ordering of component parts of the labor
force by occupation.

Land boundaries
This entry contains the total length of all land boundaries and the
individual lengths for each of the contiguous border countries.

Land use
This entry contains the percentage shares of total land area for five
different types of land use: arable land - land cultivated for crops
that are replanted after each harvest like wheat, maize, and rice;
permanent crops - land cultivated for crops that are not replanted
after each harvest like citrus, coffee, and rubber; permanent pastures
- land permanently used for herbaceous forage crops; forests and
woodland - land under dense or open stands of trees; other - any land
type not specifically mentioned above, such as urban areas, roads,
desert, etc.

Languages
This entry provides a rank ordering of languages starting with the
largest and sometimes includes the percent of total population speaking
that language.

Legal system
This entry contains a brief description of the legal system's
historical roots, role in government, and acceptance of International
Court of Justice (ICJ) jurisdiction.

Legislative branch
This entry contains information on the structure (unicameral,
bicameral, tricameral), formal name, number of seats, and term of
office. Elections includes the nature of election process or accession
to power, date of the last election, and date of the next election.
Election results includes the percent of vote and/or number of seats
held by each party in the last election.

Life expectancy at birth
This entry contains the average number of years to be lived by a group
of people born in the same year, if mortality at each age remains
constant in the future. The entry includes total population as well as
the male and female components. Life expectancy at birth is also a
measure of overall quality of life in a country and summarizes the
mortality at all ages. It can also be thought of as indicating the
potential return on investment in human capital and is necessary for
the calculation of various actuarial measures.

Literacy
This entry includes a definition of literacy and Census Bureau
percentages for the total population, males, and females. There are no
universal definitions and standards of literacy. Unless otherwise
specified, all rates are based on the most common definition - the
ability to read and write at a specified age. Detailing the standards
that individual countries use to assess the ability to read and write
is beyond the scope of the Factbook. Information on literacy, while not
a perfect measure of educational results, is probably the most easily
available and valid for international comparisons. Low levels of
literacy, and education in general, can impede the economic development
of a country in the current rapidly changing, technology-driven world.

Location
This entry identifies the country's regional location, neighboring
countries, and adjacent bodies of water.

Map references
This entry includes the name of the Factbook reference map on which a
country may be found. The entry on Geographic coordinates may be
helpful in finding some smaller countries.

Maritime claims
This entry includes the following claims: contiguous zone, continental
shelf, exclusive economic zone, exclusive fishing zone, extended
fishing zone, none (usually for a landlocked country), other (unique
maritime claims like Libya's Gulf of Sidra Closing Line or North
Korea's Military Boundary Line), and territorial sea. The proximity of
neighboring states may prevent some national claims from being extended
the full distance.

Merchant marine
Merchant marine may be defined as all ships engaged in the carriage of
goods; or all commercial vessels (as opposed to all nonmilitary ships),
which excludes tugs, fishing vessels, offshore oil rigs, etc.; or a
grouping of merchant ships by nationality or register. This entry
contains information in two subfields - total and ships by type. Total
includes the total number of ships (1,000 GRT or over), total DWT for
those ships, and total GRT for those ships. DWT or dead weight tonnage
is the total weight of cargo, plus bunkers, stores, etc. that a ship
can carry when immersed to the appropriate load line. GRT or gross
register tonnage is a figure obtained by measuring the entire sheltered
volume of the ship available for cargo and passengers and converting it
to tons on the basis of 100 cubic feet per ton; there is no stable
relationship between GRT and DWT. Ships by type includes a listing of
barge carriers, bulk cargo ships, cargo ships, chemical tankers,
combination bulk carriers, combination ore/oil carriers, container
ships, liquefied gas tankers, livestock carriers, multifunctional
large-load carriers, petroleum tankers, passenger ships,
passenger/cargo ships, railcar carriers, refrigerated cargo ships,
roll-on/roll-off cargo ships, short-sea passenger ships, specialized
tankers, and vehicle carriers.

      A captive register is a register of ships maintained by a
territory, possession, or colony primarily or exclusively for the use
of ships owned in the parent country; it is also referred to as an
offshore register, the offshore equivalent of an internal register.
Ships on a captive register will fly the same flag as the parent
country, or a local variant of it, but will be subject to the maritime
laws and taxation rules of the offshore territory. Although the nature
of a captive register makes it especially desirable for ships owned in
the parent country, just as in the internal register, the ships may
also be owned abroad. The captive register then acts as a flag of
convenience register, except that it is not the register of an
independent state.

     A flag of convenience register is a national register offering
registration to a merchant ship not owned in the flag state. The major
flags of convenience (FOC) attract ships to their registers by virtue
of low fees, low or nonexistent taxation of profits, and liberal
manning requirements. True FOC registers are characterized by having
relatively few of the registered ships actually owned in the flag
state. Thus, while virtually any flag can be used for ships under a
given set of circumstances, an FOC register is one where the majority
of the merchant fleet is owned abroad. It is also referred to as an
open register.

     A flag state is the nation in which a ship is registered and which
holds legal jurisdiction over operation of the ship, whether at home or
abroad. Maritime legislation of the flag state determines how a ship is
crewed and taxed and whether a foreign-owned ship may be placed on the
register.

     An internal register is a register of ships maintained as a subset
of a national register. Ships on the internal register fly the national
flag and have that nationality but are subject to a separate set of
maritime rules from those on the main national register. These
differences usually include lower taxation of profits, use of foreign
nationals as crewmembers, and, usually, ownership outside the flag
state (when it functions as an FOC register). The Norwegian
International Ship Register and Danish International Ship Register are
the most notable examples of an internal register. Both have been
instrumental in stemming flight from the national flag to flags of
convenience and in attracting foreign-owned ships to the Norwegian and
Danish flags.

     A merchant ship is a vessel that carries goods against payment of
freight; it is commonly used to denote any nonmilitary ship but
accurately restricted to commercial vessels only.

     A register is the record of a ship's ownership and nationality as
listed with the maritime authorities of a country; also, it is the
compendium of such individual ships' registrations. Registration of a
ship provides it with a nationality and makes it subject to the laws of
the country in which registered (the flag state) regardless of the
nationality of the ship's ultimate owner.

Military
This category includes the entries dealing with a country's military
structure, manpower, and expenditures.

Military branches
This entry lists the names of the ground, naval, air, marine, and other
defense or security forces.

Military expenditures - dollar figure
This entry gives current military expenditures in US dollars; the
figure is calculated by multiplying the estimated defense spending in
percentage terms by the gross domestic product (GDP) calculated on an
exchange rate basis not purchasing power parity (PPP) terms. However,
in the case of Russia, estimates of military expenditures have been
made using PPP. Dollar figures for military expenditures should be
treated with caution because of different price patterns and accounting
methods among nations, as well as wide variations in the strength of
their currencies.

Military expenditures - percent of GDP
This entry gives current military expenditures as an estimated percent
of gross domestic product (GDP).

Military manpower - availability
This entry gives the total numbers of males and females age 15-49 and
assumes that every individual is fit to serve.

Military manpower - fit for military service
This entry gives the number of males and females age 15-49 fit for
military service. This is a more refined measure of potential military
manpower availability which tries to correct for the health situation
in the country and reduces the maximum potential number to a more
realistic estimate of the actual number fit to serve.

Military manpower - military age
This entry gives the minimum age at which an individual may volunteer
for military service or be subject to conscription.

Military manpower - reaching military age annually
This entry gives the number of draft-age males and females entering the
military manpower pool in any given year and is a measure of the
availability of draft-age young adults.

Military - note
This entry includes miscellaneous military information of significance
not included elsewhere.

Money figures
All money figures are expressed in contemporaneous US dollars unless
otherwise indicated.

National holiday
This entry gives the primary national day of celebration - usually
independence day.

Nationality
This entry provides the identifying terms for citizens - noun and
adjective.

Natural hazards
This entry lists potential natural disasters.

Natural resources
This entry lists a country's mineral, petroleum, hydropower, and other
resources of commercial importance.

Net migration rate
This entry includes the figure for the difference between the number of
persons entering and leaving a country during the year per 1,000
persons (based on midyear population). An excess of persons entering
the country is referred to as net immigration (e.g., 3.56
migrants/1,000 population); an excess of persons leaving the country as
net emigration (e.g., -9.26 migrants/1,000 population). The net
migration rate indicates the contribution of migration to the overall
level of population change. High levels of migration can cause problems
such as increasing unemployment and potential ethnic strife (if people
are coming in) or a reduction in the labor force, perhaps in certain
key sectors (if people are leaving).

People
This category includes the entries dealing with the characteristics of
the people and their society.

People - note
This entry includes miscellaneous demographic information of
significance not included elsewhere.

Personal Names - Capitalization
The Factbook capitalizes the surname or family name of individuals for
the convenience of our users who are faced with a world of different
cultures and naming conventions. An example would be President SADDAM
Husayn of Iraq. Saddam is his name and Husayn is his father's name. He
may be referred to as President SADDAM Husayn or President SADDAM, but
not President Husayn. The need for capitalization, bold type,
underlining, italics, or some other indicator of the individual's
surname is apparent in the following examples:  MAO Zedong, Fidel
CASTRO Ruz, George W. BUSH, and TUNKU SALAHUDDIN Abdul Aziz Shah ibni
Al-Marhum Sultan Hisammuddin Alam Shah.  By knowing the surname, a
short form without all capital letters can be used with confidence as
in President Saddam, President Castro, Chairman Mao, President Bush, or
Sultan Tunku Salahuddin.  The same system of capitalization is extended
to the names of leaders with surnames that are not commonly used such
as Queen ELIZABETH II.

Personal Names - Spelling
The romanization of personal names in the Factbook normally follows the
same transliteration system used by the US Board on Geographic Names
for spelling place names.  At times, however, a foreign leader
expressly indicates a preference for, or the media or official
documents regularly use, a romanized spelling that differs from the
transliteration derived from the US Government standard.  In such
cases, the Factbook uses the alternative spelling.

Personal Names - Titles
The Factbook capitalizes any valid title (or short form of it)
immediately preceding a person's name.  A title standing alone is
lowercased. Examples:  President PUTIN and President BUSH are chiefs of
state.  In Russia, the president is chief of state and the premier is
the head of the government, while in the US, the president is both
chief of state and head of government.

Pipelines
This entry gives the lengths and types of pipelines for transporting
products like natural gas, crude oil, or petroleum products.

Political parties and leaders
This entry includes a listing of significant political organizations
and their leaders.

Political pressure groups and leaders
This entry includes a listing of organizations with leaders involved in
politics, but not standing for legislative election.

Population
This entry gives an estimate from the US Bureau of the Census based on
statistics from population censuses, vital statistics registration
systems, or sample surveys pertaining to the recent past and on
assumptions about future trends. The total population presents one
overall measure of the potential impact of the country on the world and
within its region. Note:  starting with the 1993 Factbook, demographic
estimates for some countries (mostly African) have explicitly taken
into account the effects of the growing impact of the HIV/AIDS
epidemic.  These countries are currently: The Bahamas, Benin, Botswana,
Brazil, Burkina Faso, Burma, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Central
African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of the
Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras,
Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, South
Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, and
Zimbabwe.

Population below poverty line
National estimates of the percentage of the population lying below the
poverty line are based on surveys of sub-groups, with the results
weighted by the number of people in each group. Definitions of poverty
vary considerably among nations. For example, rich nations generally
employ more generous standards of poverty than poor nations.

Population growth rate
The average annual percent change in the population, resulting from a
surplus (or deficit) of births over deaths and the balance of migrants
entering and leaving a country. The rate may be positive or negative.
The growth rate is a factor in determining how great a burden would be
imposed on a country by the changing needs of its people for
infrastructure (e.g., schools, hospitals, housing, roads), resources
(e.g., food, water, electricity), and jobs. Rapid population growth can
be seen as threatening by neighboring countries.

Ports and harbors
This entry lists the major ports and harbors selected on the basis of
overall importance to each country.  This is determined by evaluating a
number of factors (e.g., dollar value of goods handled, gross tonnage,
facilities, military significance).

Radio broadcast stations
This entry includes the total number of AM, FM, and shortwave broadcast
stations.

Radios
This entry gives the total number of radio receivers.

Railways
This entry includes the total route length of the railway network and
of its component parts by gauge: broad, dual, narrow, standard, and
other.

Reference maps
This section includes world, regional, and special or current interest
maps.

Religions
This entry includes a rank ordering of religions by adherents starting
with the largest group and sometimes includes the percent of total
population.

Sex ratio
This entry includes the number of males for each female in five age
groups - at birth, under 15 years, 15-64 years, 65 years and over, and
for the total population. Sex ratio at birth has recently emerged as an
indicator of certain kinds of sex discrimination in some countries. For
instance, high sex ratios at birth in some Asian countries are now
attributed to sex-selective abortion and infanticide due to a strong
preference for sons. This will affect future marriage patterns and
fertility patterns. Eventually it could cause unrest among young adult
males who are unable to find partners.

Suffrage
This entry gives the age at enfranchisement and whether the right to
vote is universal or restricted.

Telephone numbers
All telephone numbers in the Factbook consist of the country code in
brackets, the city or area code (where required) in parentheses, and
the local number. The one component that is not presented is the
international access code, which varies from country to country. For
example, an international direct dial telephone call placed from the US
to Madrid, Spain, would be as follows:

     011 [34] (1) 577-xxxx, where
     011 is the international access code for station-to-station calls;
01 is for calls other than station-to-station calls,
     [34] is the country code for Spain,
     (1) is the city code for Madrid,
     577 is the local exchange, and
     xxxx is the local telephone number.

An international direct dial telephone call placed from another country
to the US would be as follows:
     international access code + [1] (202) 939-xxxx, where
     [1] is the country code for the US,
     (202) is the area code for Washington, DC,
     939 is the local exchange, and
     xxxx is the local telephone number.

Telephone system
This entry includes a brief characterization of the system with details
on the domestic and international components. The following terms and
abbreviations are used throughout the entry:

     Africa ONE - a fiber-optic submarine cable link encircling the
continent of Africa.

     Arabsat - Arab Satellite Communications Organization (Riyadh,
Saudi Arabia).

     Autodin - Automatic Digital Network (US Department of Defense).

     CB - citizen's band mobile radio communications.

     cellular telephone system - the telephones in this system are
radio transceivers, with each instrument having its own private radio
frequency and sufficient radiated power to reach the booster station in

This entry gives the total number of main telephone lines in use.

Telephones - mobile cellular
This entry gives the total number of mobile cellular telephones in use.

Television - broadcast stations
This entry gives the total number of separate broadcast stations plus
any repeater stations.

Televisions
This entry gives the total number of television sets.

Terminology
Due to the highly structured nature of the Factbook database, some
collective generic terms have to be used. For example, the word Country
in the Country name entry refers to a wide variety of dependencies,
areas of special sovereignty, uninhabited islands, and other entities
in addition to the traditional countries or independent states.
Military is also used as an umbrella term for various civil defense,
security, and defense activities in many entries. The Independence
entry includes the usual colonial independence dates and former ruling
states as well as other significant nationhood dates such as the
traditional founding date or the date of unification, federation,
confederation, establishment, or state succession that are not strictly
independence dates. Dependent areas have the nature of their dependency
status noted in this same entry.

Terrain
This entry contains a brief description of the topography.

Total fertility rate
This entry gives a figure for the average number of children that would
be born per woman if all women lived to the end of their childbearing
years and bore children according to a given fertility rate at each
age. The total fertility rate is a more direct measure of the level of
fertility than the crude birth rate, since it refers to births per
woman. This indicator shows the potential for population growth in the
country. High rates will also place some limits on the labor force
participation rates for women. Large numbers of children born to women
indicate large family sizes that might limit the ability of the
families to feed and educate their children.

Transnational Issues
This category includes only two entries at the present time - Disputes
- international and Illicit drugs - that deal with current issues going
beyond national boundaries.

Transportation
This category includes the entries dealing with the means for movement
of people and goods.

Transportation - note
This entry includes miscellaneous transportation information of
significance not included elsewhere.

Unemployment rate
This entry contains the percent of the labor force that is without
jobs. Substantial underemployment might be noted.

Waterways
This entry gives the total length and individual names of navigable
rivers, canals, and other inland bodies of water.

Years
All year references are for the calendar year (CY) unless indicated as
fiscal year (FY). The calendar year is an accounting period of 12
months from 1 January to 31 December. The fiscal year is an accounting
period of 12 months other than 1 January to 31 December.

A Brief History of Basic Intelligence and The World Factbook


The Intelligence Cycle is the process by which information is acquired,
converted into intelligence, and made available to policymakers.
Information is raw data from any source, data that may be fragmentary,
contradictory, unreliable, ambiguous, deceptive, or wrong.
Intelligence is information that has been collected, integrated,
evaluated, analyzed, and interpreted. Finished intelligence is the
final product of the Intelligence Cycle ready to be delivered to the
policymaker.

The three types of finished intelligence are: basic, current, and
estimative. Basic intelligence provides the fundamental and factual
reference material on a country or issue. Current intelligence reports
on new developments. Estimative intelligence judges probable outcomes.
The three are mutually supportive: basic intelligence is the foundation
on which the other two are constructed; current intelligence
continually updates the  inventory of knowledge; and estimative
intelligence revises overall interpretations of country and issue
prospects for guidance of basic and  current intelligence. The World
Factbook, The President's Daily Brief, and the National Intelligence
Estimates are examples of the three types of finished intelligence.

The United States has carried on foreign intelligence activities since
the days of George Washington but only since World War II have they
been coordinated on a government-wide basis. Three programs have
highlighted the development of coordinated basic intelligence since
that time: (1) the Joint Army Navy Intelligence Studies (JANIS), (2)
the National Intelligence Survey (NIS), and (3) The World Factbook.

During World War II, intelligence consumers realized that the
production of basic intelligence by different components of the US
Government resulted in a great duplication of effort and conflicting
information. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 brought home
to leaders in Congress and the executive branch the need for
integrating departmental reports to national policymakers. Detailed and
coordinated information was needed not only on such major powers as
Germany and Japan, but also on places of little previous interest. In
the Pacific Theater, for example, the Navy and Marines had to launch
amphibious operations against many islands about which information was
unconfirmed or nonexistent. Intelligence authorities resolved that the
United States should never again be caught unprepared.

In 1943, Gen. George B. Strong (G-2), Adm. H. C. Train (Office of Naval
Intelligence - ONI), and Gen. William J. Donovan (Director of the
Office of Strategic Services - OSS) decided that a joint effort should
be initiated. A steering committee was appointed on 27 April 1943 that
recommended the formation of a Joint Intelligence Study Publishing
Board to assemble, edit, coordinate, and publish the Joint Army Navy
Intelligence Studies (JANIS). JANIS was the first interdepartmental
basic intelligence program to fulfill the needs of the US Government
for an authoritative and coordinated appraisal of strategic basic
intelligence. Between April 1943 and July 1947, the board published 34
JANIS studies. JANIS performed well in the war effort, and numerous
letters of commendation were received, including a statement from Adm.
Forrest Sherman, Chief of Staff, Pacific Ocean Areas, which said,
"JANIS has become the indispensable reference work for the shore-based
planners."

The need for more comprehensive basic intelligence in the postwar world
was well expressed in 1946 by George S. Pettee, a noted author on
national security. He wrote in The Future of American Secret
Intelligence (Infantry Journal Press, 1946, page 46) that world
leadership in peace requires even more elaborate intelligence than in
war. "The conduct of peace involves all countries, all human activities
- not just the enemy and his war production."

The Central Intelligence Agency was established on 26 July 1947 and
officially began operating on 18 September 1947. Effective 1 October
1947, the Director of Central Intelligence assumed operational
responsibility for JANIS. On 13 January 1948, the National Security
Council issued Intelligence Directive (NSCID) No. 3, which authorized
the National Intelligence Survey (NIS) program as a peacetime
replacement for the wartime JANIS program. Before adequate NIS country
sections could be produced, government agencies had to develop more
comprehensive gazetteers and better maps. The US Board on Geographic
Names (BGN) compiled the names; the Department of the Interior produced
the gazetteers; and CIA produced the maps.

The Hoover Commission's Clark Committee, set up in 1954 to study the
structure and administration of the CIA, reported to Congress in 1955
that: "The National Intelligence Survey is an invaluable publication
which provides the essential elements of basic intelligence on all
areas of the world.  There will always be a continuing requirement for
keeping the Survey up-to-date." The Factbook was created as an annual
summary and update to the encyclopedic NIS studies. The first
classified Factbook was published in August 1962, and the first
unclassified version was published in June 1971. The NIS program was
terminated in 1973 except for the Factbook, map, and gazetteer
components. The 1975 Factbook was the first to be made available to the
public with sales through the US Government Printing Office (GPO). The
1996 edition was printed by GPO, and the 1997 edition was reprinted by
GPO.  The year 2001 marks the 54th anniversary of the establishment of
the Central Intelligence Agency and the 58th year of continuous basic
intelligence support to the US Government by The World Factbook and its
two predecessor programs.

Afghanistan    Economy

Economy - overview: Afghanistan is an extremely poor, landlocked
country, highly dependent on farming and livestock raising (sheep
and goats). Economic considerations have played second fiddle to
political and military upheavals during two decades of war,
including the nearly 10-year Soviet military occupation (which ended
15 February 1989). During that conflict one-third of the population
fled the country, with Pakistan and Iran sheltering a combined peak
of more than 6 million refugees. In early 2000, 2 million Afghan
refugees remained in Pakistan and about 1.4 million in Iran. Gross
domestic product has fallen substantially over the past 20 years
because of the loss of labor and capital and the disruption of trade
and transport; severe drought added to the nation's difficulties in
1998-2000. The majority of the population continues to suffer from
insufficient food, clothing, housing, and medical care. Inflation
remains a serious problem throughout the country. International aid
can deal with only a fraction of the humanitarian problem, let alone
promote economic development. In 1999-2000, internal civil strife
continued, hampering both domestic economic policies and
international aid efforts. Numerical data are likely to be either
unavailable or unreliable. Afghanistan was by far the largest
producer of opium poppies in 2000, and narcotics trafficking is a
major source of revenue.

Albania    Introduction

Background: In 1990 Albania ended 44 years of xenophobic communist
rule and established a multiparty democracy. The transition has
proven difficult as corrupt governments have tried to deal with high
unemployment, a dilapidated infrastructure, widespread gangsterism,
and disruptive political opponents. International observers judged
local elections in 2000 to be acceptable and a step toward
democratic development, but serious deficiencies remain to be
corrected before the the 2001 parliamentary elections.

Albania    Economy

Economy - overview: Poor by European standards, Albania is making
the difficult transition to a more open-market economy. The economy
rebounded in 1993-95 after a severe depression accompanying the end
of the previous centrally planned system in 1990 and 1991. However,
a weakening of government resolve to maintain stabilization policies
in the election year of 1996 contributed to renewal of inflationary
pressures, spurred by the budget deficit which exceeded 12% of GDP.
The collapse of financial pyramid schemes in early 1997 - which had
attracted deposits from a substantial portion of Albania's
population - triggered severe social unrest which led to more than
1,500 deaths, widespread destruction of property, and a 7% drop in
GDP. The government has taken measures to curb violent crime and to
revive economic activity and trade. The economy is bolstered by
remittances from some 20% of the labor force that works abroad,
mostly in Greece and Italy. These remittances supplement GDP and
help offset the large foreign trade deficit. Most agricultural land
was privatized in 1992, substantially improving peasant incomes. In
1998, Albania recovered the 7% drop in GDP of 1997 and pushed ahead
by 8% in 1999 and by 7.5% in 2000. International aid helped defray
the high costs of receiving and returning refugees from the Kosovo
conflict. Privatization scored some successes in 2000, but other
reforms lagged.

Algeria    Introduction

Background: After a century of rule by France, Algeria became
independent in 1962. The surprising first round success of the
fundamentalist FIS (Islamic Salvation Front) party in December 1991
balloting caused the army to intervene, crack down on the FIS, and
postpone the subsequent elections. The FIS response has resulted in
a continuous low-grade civil conflict with the secular state
apparatus, which nonetheless has allowed elections featuring
pro-government and moderate religious-based parties. FIS's armed
wing, the Islamic Salvation Army, disbanded itself in January 2000
and many armed militants surrendered under an amnesty program
designed to promote national reconciliation. Nevertheless, residual
fighting continues. Other concerns include large-scale unemployment
and the need to diversify the petroleum-based economy.

Algeria    Economy

Economy - overview: The hydrocarbons sector is the backbone of the
economy, accounting for roughly 60% of budget revenues, 30% of GDP,
and over 95% of export earnings. Algeria has the fifth-largest
reserves of natural gas in the world and is the second largest gas
exporter; it ranks fourteenth for oil reserves. Algiers' efforts to
reform one of the most centrally planned economies in the Arab world
stalled in 1992 as the country became embroiled in political
turmoil. Algeria's financial and economic indicators improved during
the mid-1990s, in part because of policy reforms supported by the
IMF and debt rescheduling from the Paris Club. Algeria's finances in
2000 benefited from the spike in oil prices and the government's
tight fiscal policy, leading to a large increase in the trade
surplus, the near tripling of foreign exchange reserves, and
reduction in foreign debt. The government continues efforts to
diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment
outside the energy sector, but has had little success in reducing
high unemployment and improving living standards.

@American Samoa





American Samoa    Introduction

Background: Settled as early as 1000 B. C., Samoa was "discovered"
by European explorers in the 18th century. International rivalries
in the latter half of the 19th century were settled by an 1899
treaty in which Germany and the US divided the Samoan archipelago.
The US formally occupied its portion - a smaller group of eastern
islands with the excellent harbor of Pago Pago - the following year.

American Samoa    Economy

Economy - overview: This is a traditional Polynesian economy in
which more than 90% of the land is communally owned. Economic
activity is strongly linked to the US, with which American Samoa
conducts the great bulk of its foreign trade. Tuna fishing and tuna
processing plants are the backbone of the private sector, with
canned tuna the primary export. Transfers from the US Government add
substantially to American Samoa's economic well-being. Attempts by
the government to develop a larger and broader economy are
restrained by Samoa's remote location, its limited transportation,
and its devastating hurricanes. Tourism, a developing sector, has
been held back by the recurring financial difficulties in East Asia.

Andorra    Economy

Economy - overview: Tourism, the mainstay of Andorra's tiny,
well-to-do economy, accounts for roughly 80% of GDP. An estimated 9
million tourists visit annually, attracted by Andorra's duty-free
status and by its summer and winter resorts. Andorra's comparative
advantage has recently eroded as the economies of neighboring France
and Spain have been opened up, providing broader availability of
goods and lower tariffs. The banking sector, with its "tax haven"
status, also contributes substantially to the economy. Agricultural
production is limited by a scarcity of arable land, and most food
has to be imported. The principal livestock activity is sheep
raising. Manufacturing output consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars,
and furniture. Andorra is a member of the EU Customs Union and is
treated as an EU member for trade in manufactured goods (no tariffs)
and as a non-EU member for agricultural products.

Angola    Introduction

Background: Civil war has been the norm in Angola since independence
from Portugal in 1975. A 1994 peace accord between the government
and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)
provided for the integration of former UNITA insurgents into the
government and armed forces. A national unity government was
installed in April of 1997, but serious fighting resumed in late
1998, rendering hundreds of thousands of people homeless. Up to 1.5
million lives may have been lost in fighting over the past quarter
century.

Angola    Economy

Economy - overview: Angola is an economy in disarray because of a
quarter century of nearly continuous warfare. Despite its abundant
natural resources, output per capita is among the world's lowest.
Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for 85% of the
population. Oil production and the supporting activities are vital
to the economy, contributing about 45% to GDP and 90% of exports.
Violence continues, millions of land mines remain, and many farmers
are reluctant to return to their fields. As a result, much of the
country's food must still be imported. To fully take advantage of
its rich resources - gold, diamonds, extensive forests, Atlantic
fisheries, and large oil deposits - Angola will need to end its
conflict and continue reforming government policies. Despite the
increase in the pace of civil warfare in late 1998, the economy grew
by an estimated 5% in 2000. The government introduced new currency
denominations in 1999, including 1 and 5 kwanza notes. Internal
strife discourages investment outside of the petroleum sector, which
is producing roughly 800,000 barrels of oil per day. Angola has
entered into a Staff Monitored Program (SMP) with the IMF. Continued
growth depends on sharp cuts in inflation, further economic reform,
and a lessening of fighting.

@Anguilla





Anguilla    Introduction

Background: Colonized by English settlers from Saint Kitts in 1650,
Anguilla was administered by Great Britain until the early 19th
century, when the island - against the wishes of the inhabitants -
was incorporated into a single British dependency along with Saint
Kitts and Nevis. Several attempts at separation failed. In 1971, two
years after a revolt, Anguilla was finally allowed to secede; this
arrangement was formally recognized in 1980 with Anguilla becoming a
separate British dependency.

Anguilla    Economy

Economy - overview: Anguilla has few natural resources, and the
economy depends heavily on luxury tourism, offshore banking, lobster
fishing, and remittances from emigrants. The economy, and especially
the tourism sector, suffered a setback in late 1995 due to the
effects of Hurricane Luis in September but recovered in 1996.
Increased activity in the tourism industry, which has spurred the
growth of the construction sector, has contributed to economic
growth. Anguillan officials have put substantial effort into
developing the offshore financial sector. A comprehensive package of
financial services legislation was enacted in late 1994. In the
medium term, prospects for the economy will depend on the tourism
sector and, therefore, on continuing income growth in the
industrialized nations as well as favorable weather conditions.

Antarctica    Introduction

Background: Speculation over the existence of a "southern land" was
not confirmed until the early 1820s when British and American
commercial operators and British and Russian national expeditions
began exploring the Peninsula region and areas south of the
Antarctic Circle. Not until 1838 was it established that Antarctica
was indeed a continent and not just a group of islands. Various
"firsts" were achieved in the early 20th century, including: 1902,
first balloon flight (by British explorer Robert Falcon SCOTT);
1912, first to the South Pole (five Norwegian explorers under Roald
AMUNDSEN); 1928, first fixed-wing aircraft flight (by Australian
adventurer/explorer Sir Hubert WILKINS); 1929, first flight over the
South Pole (by Americans Richard BYRD and Bernt BALCHEN); and 1935,
first transantarctic flight (American Lincoln ELLSWORTH). Following
World War II, there was an upsurge in scientific research on the
continent. A number of countries have set up year-round research
stations on Antarctica. Seven have made territorial claims, but no
other country recognizes these claims. In order to form a legal
framework for the activities of nations on the continent, an
Antarctic Treaty was negotiated that neither denies nor gives
recognition to existing territorial claims; signed in 1959, it
entered into force in 1961.



Antarctica    Geography

Location: continent mostly south of the Antarctic Circle

Geographic coordinates: 90 00 S, 0 00 E

Map references: Antarctic Region

Area: total:  14 million sq km

land:  14 million sq km (280,000 sq km ice-free, 13.72 million sq km
ice-covered) (est.)

note:  fifth-largest continent, following Asia, Africa, North
America, and South America, but larger than Australia and the
subcontinent of Europe

Area - comparative: slightly less than 1.5 times the size of the US

Land boundaries: 0 km

note:  see entry on International disputes

Coastline: 17,968 km

Maritime claims: none; twenty of 27 Antarctic consultative nations
have made no claims to Antarctic territory (although Russia and the
US have reserved the right to do so) and do not recognize the claims
of the other nations; also see the Disputes - international entry

Climate: severe low temperatures vary with latitude, elevation, and
distance from the ocean; East Antarctica is colder than West
Antarctica because of its higher elevation; Antarctic Peninsula has
the most moderate climate; higher temperatures occur in January
along the coast and average slightly below freezing

Terrain: about 98% thick continental ice sheet and 2% barren rock,
with average elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters; mountain
ranges up to 5,140 meters; ice-free coastal areas include parts of
southern Victoria Land, Wilkes Land, the Antarctic Peninsula area,
and parts of Ross Island on McMurdo Sound; glaciers form ice shelves
along about half of the coastline, and floating ice shelves
constitute 11% of the area of the continent

Elevation extremes: lowest point:  Bentley Subglacial Trench -2,540 m

highest point:  Vinson Massif 5,140 m

note:  the lowest known land point in Antarctica is hidden in the
Bentley Subglacial Trench; at its surface is the deepest ice yet
discovered and the world's lowest elevation not under sea water

Natural resources: iron ore, chromium, copper, gold, nickel,
platinum and other minerals, and coal and hydrocarbons have been
found in small uncommercial quantities; none presently exploited;
krill, finfish, and crab have been taken by commercial fisheries

Land use: arable land:  0%

permanent crops:  0%

permanent pastures:  0%

forests and woodland:  0%

other:  100% (ice 98%, barren rock 2%)

Irrigated land: 0 sq km (1993)

Natural hazards: katabatic (gravity-driven) winds blow coastward
from the high interior; frequent blizzards form near the foot of the
plateau; cyclonic storms form over the ocean and move clockwise
along the coast; volcanism on Deception Island and isolated areas of
West Antarctica; other seismic activity rare and weak; large
icebergs may calve from ice shelf

Environment - current issues: in 1998, NASA satellite data showed
that the antarctic ozone hole was the largest on record, covering 27
million square kilometers; researchers in 1997 found that increased
ultraviolet light coming through the hole damages the DNA of
icefish, an antarctic fish lacking hemoglobin; ozone depletion
earlier was shown to harm one-celled antarctic marine plants

Geography - note: the coldest, windiest, highest (on average), and
driest continent; during summer, more solar radiation reaches the
surface at the South Pole than is received at the Equator in an
equivalent period; mostly uninhabitable



Antarctica    People

Population: no indigenous inhabitants, but there are seasonally
staffed research stations

note:  approximately 29 nations, all signatory to the Antarctic
Treaty, send personnel to perform seasonal (summer) and year-round
research on the continent and in its surrounding oceans; the
population of persons doing and supporting science on the continent
and its nearby islands south of 60 degrees south latitude (the
region covered by the Antarctic Treaty) varies from approximately
4,000 in summer to 1,000 in winter; in addition, approximately 1,000
personnel including ship's crew and scientists doing onboard
research are present in the waters of the treaty region; Summer

est.)



Antarctica    Government

Country name: conventional long form:  none

conventional short form:  Antarctica

Government type: Antarctic Treaty Summary - the Antarctic Treaty,
signed on 1 December 1959 and entered into force on 23 June 1961,
establishes the legal framework for the management of Antarctica.
The 23rd Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting was held in Peru in
May 1999. At the end of 2000, there were 44 treaty member nations:
27 consultative and 17 non-consultative. Consultative (voting)
members include the seven nations that claim portions of Antarctica
as national territory (some claims overlap) and 20 nonclaimant
nations. The US and Russia have reserved the right to make claims.
The US does not recognize the claims of others. Antarctica is
administered through meetings of the consultative member nations.
Decisions from these meetings are carried out by these member
nations (within their areas) in accordance with their own national
laws. The year in parentheses indicates when an acceding nation was
voted to full consultative (voting) status, while no date indicates
the country was an original 1959 treaty signatory. Claimant nations
are - Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, New Zealand, Norway, and
the UK. Nonclaimant consultative nations are - Belgium, Brazil
(1983), Bulgaria (1998) China (1985), Ecuador (1990), Finland
(1989), Germany (1981), India (1983), Italy (1987), Japan, South
Korea (1989), Netherlands (1990), Peru (1989), Poland (1977),
Russia, South Africa, Spain (1988), Sweden (1988), Uruguay (1985),
and the US. Non-consultative (nonvoting) members, with year of
accession in parentheses, are - Austria (1987), Canada (1988),
Colombia (1989), Cuba (1984), Czech Republic (1993), Denmark (1965),
Greece (1987), Guatemala (1991), Hungary (1984), North Korea (1987),
Papua New Guinea (1981), Romania (1971), Slovakia (1993),
Switzerland (1990), Turkey (1995), Ukraine (1992), and Venezuela
(1999). Article 1 - area to be used for peaceful purposes only;
military activity, such as weapons testing, is prohibited, but
military personnel and equipment may be used for scientific research
or any other peaceful purpose; Article 2 - freedom of scientific
investigation and cooperation shall continue; Article 3 - free
exchange of information and personnel, cooperation with the UN and
other international agencies; Article 4 - does not recognize,
dispute, or establish territorial claims and no new claims shall be
asserted while the treaty is in force; Article 5 - prohibits nuclear
explosions or disposal of radioactive wastes; Article 6 - includes
under the treaty all land and ice shelves south of 60 degrees 00
minutes south and reserves high seas rights; Article 7 -
treaty-state observers have free access, including aerial
observation, to any area and may inspect all stations,
installations, and equipment; advance notice of all expeditions and
of the introduction of military personnel must be given; Article 8 -
allows for jurisdiction over observers and scientists by their own
states; Article 9 - frequent consultative meetings take place among
member nations; Article 10 - treaty states will discourage
activities by any country in Antarctica that are contrary to the
treaty; Article 11 - disputes to be settled peacefully by the
parties concerned or, ultimately, by the ICJ; Articles 12, 13, 14 -
deal with upholding, interpreting, and amending the treaty among
involved nations. Other agreements - some 200 recommendations
adopted at treaty consultative meetings and ratified by governments
include - Agreed Measures for Fauna and Flora (1964) which were
later incorporated into the Environmental Protocol; Convention for
the Conservation of Antarctic Seals (1972); Convention on the
Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (1980); a mineral
resources agreement was signed in 1988 but remains unratified; the
Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty was
signed 4 October 1991 and entered into force 14 January 1998; this
agreement provides for the protection of the Antarctic environment
through five specific annexes: 1) marine pollution, 2) fauna and
flora, 3) environmental impact assessments, 4) waste management, and
5) protected area management; it prohibits all activities relating
to mineral resources except scientific research.

Legal system: Antarctica is administered through meetings of the
consultative member nations. Decisions from these meetings are
carried out by these member nations (within their areas) in
accordance with their own national laws. US law, including certain
criminal offenses by or against US nationals, such as murder, may
apply extra-territorially. Some US laws directly apply to
Antarctica. For example, the Antarctic Conservation Act, 16 U.S.C.
section 2401 et seq., provides civil and criminal penalties for the
following activities, unless authorized by regulation of statute:
the taking of native mammals or birds; the introduction of
nonindigenous plants and animals; entry into specially protected
areas; the discharge or disposal of pollutants; and the importation
into the US of certain items from Antarctica. Violation of the
Antarctic Conservation Act carries penalties of up to $10,000 in
fines and one year in prison. The National Science Foundation and
Department of Justice share enforcement responsibilities. Public Law
95-541, the US Antarctic Conservation Act of 1978, as amended in
1996, requires expeditions from the US to Antarctica to notify, in
advance, the Office of Oceans and Polar Affairs, Room 5801,
Department of State, Washington, DC 20520, which reports such plans
to other nations as required by the Antarctic Treaty. For more

Antarctica    Economy

Economy - overview: Fishing off the coast and tourism, both based
abroad, account for the limited economic activity. Antarctic
fisheries in 1998-99 (1 July-30 June) reported landing 119,898
metric tons. Unregulated fishing landed five to six times more than
the regulated fishery, and allegedly illegal fishing in antarctic
waters in 1998 resulted in the seizure (by France and Australia) of
at least eight fishing ships. Companies interested in commercial
fishing activities in Antarctica have put forward proposals. The
Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources
determines the recommended catch limits for marine species. A total
of 13,193 tourists visited in the 1999-2000 summer, up from the
10,013 who visited the previous year. Nearly all of them were
passengers on 24 commercial (nongovernmental) ships and several
yachts that made 143 trips during the summer. Most tourist trips
lasted approximately two weeks.

Antigua and Barbuda    Economy

Economy - overview: Tourism continues to be the dominant activity in
the economy accounting directly or indirectly for more than half of
GDP. The budding offshore financial sector has been seriously hurt
by financial sanctions imposed by the US and UK as a result of the
loosening of its money-laundering controls. The government has made
efforts to comply with international demands in order to get the
sanctions lifted. Antigua and Barbuda was listed as a tax haven by
the OECD in 2000. The dual island nation's agricultural production
is mainly directed to the domestic market; the sector is constrained
by the limited water supply and labor shortages that reflect the
pull of higher wages in tourism and construction. Manufacturing
comprises enclave-type assembly for export with major products being
bedding, handicrafts, and electronic components. Prospects for
economic growth in the medium term will continue to depend on income
growth in the industrialized world, especially in the US, which
accounts for about one-third of all tourist arrivals.

@Arctic Ocean

Arctic Ocean    Introduction Top of Page

Background: The Arctic Ocean is the smallest of the world's five
oceans (after the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, and
the recently delimited Southern Ocean). The Northwest Passage (US
and Canada) and Northern Sea Route (Norway and Russia) are two
important seasonal waterways. A sparse network of air, ocean, river,
and land routes circumscribes the Arctic Ocean.



Arctic Ocean    Geography

Location: body of water between Europe, Asia, and North America,
mostly north of the Arctic Circle

Geographic coordinates: 90 00 N, 0 00 E

Map references: Arctic Region

Area: total:  14.056 million sq km

note:  includes Baffin Bay, Barents Sea, Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea,
East Siberian Sea, Greenland Sea, Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Kara
Sea, Laptev Sea, Northwest Passage, and other tributary water bodies

Area - comparative: slightly less than 1.5 times the size of the US

Coastline: 45,389 km

Climate: polar climate characterized by persistent cold and
relatively narrow annual temperature ranges; winters characterized
by continuous darkness, cold and stable weather conditions, and
clear skies; summers characterized by continuous daylight, damp and
foggy weather, and weak cyclones with rain or snow

Terrain: central surface covered by a perennial drifting polar
icepack that averages about 3 meters in thickness, although pressure
ridges may be three times that size; clockwise drift pattern in the
Beaufort Gyral Stream, but nearly straight-line movement from the
New Siberian Islands (Russia) to Denmark Strait (between Greenland
and Iceland); the icepack is surrounded by open seas during the
summer, but more than doubles in size during the winter and extends
to the encircling landmasses; the ocean floor is about 50%
continental shelf (highest percentage of any ocean) with the
remainder a central basin interrupted by three submarine ridges
(Alpha Cordillera, Nansen Cordillera, and Lomonosov Ridge)

Elevation extremes: lowest point:  Fram Basin -4,665 m

highest point:  sea level 0 m

Natural resources: sand and gravel aggregates, placer deposits,
polymetallic nodules, oil and gas fields, fish, marine mammals
(seals and whales)

Natural hazards: ice islands occasionally break away from northern
Ellesmere Island; icebergs calved from glaciers in western Greenland
and extreme northeastern Canada; permafrost in islands; virtually
ice locked from October to June; ships subject to superstructure
icing from October to May

Environment - current issues: endangered marine species include
walruses and whales; fragile ecosystem slow to change and slow to
recover from disruptions or damage; thinning polar icepack

Geography - note: major chokepoint is the southern Chukchi Sea
(northern access to the Pacific Ocean via the Bering Strait);
strategic location between North America and Russia; shortest marine
link between the extremes of eastern and western Russia; floating
research stations operated by the US and Russia; maximum snow cover
in March or April about 20 to 50 centimeters over the frozen ocean;
snow cover lasts about 10 months



Arctic Ocean    Economy

Economy - overview: Economic activity is limited to the exploitation
of natural resources, including petroleum, natural gas, fish, and
seals.



Arctic Ocean    Transportation

Ports and harbors: Churchill (Canada), Murmansk (Russia), Prudhoe
Bay (US)

Transportation - note: sparse network of air, ocean, river, and land
routes; the Northwest Passage (North America) and Northern Sea Route
(Eurasia) are important seasonal waterways



Arctic Ocean    Transnational Issues

Disputes - international: some maritime disputes (see littoral
states)

Argentina    Economy

Economy - overview: Argentina benefits from rich natural resources,
a highly literate population, an export-oriented agricultural
sector, and a diversified industrial base. However, when President
Carlos MENEM took office in 1989, the country had piled up huge
external debts, inflation had reached 200% per month, and output was
plummeting. To combat the economic crisis, the government embarked
on a path of trade liberalization, deregulation, and privatization.
In 1991, it implemented radical monetary reforms which pegged the
peso to the US dollar and limited the growth in the monetary base by
law to the growth in reserves. Inflation fell sharply in subsequent
years. In 1995, the Mexican peso crisis produced capital flight, the
loss of banking system deposits, and a severe, but short-lived,
recession; a series of reforms to bolster the domestic banking
system followed. Real GDP growth recovered strongly, reaching 8% in
1997. In 1998, international financial turmoil caused by Russia's
problems and increasing investor anxiety over Brazil produced the
highest domestic interest rates in more than three years, halving
the growth rate of the economy. Conditions worsened in 1999 with GDP
falling by 3%. President Fernando DE LA RUA, who took office in
December 1999, sponsored tax increases and spending cuts to reduce
the deficit, which had ballooned to 2.5% of GDP in 1999. Growth in
2000 was a disappointing 0.8%, as both domestic and foreign
investors remained skeptical of the government's ability to pay
debts and maintain its fixed exchange rate with the US dollar. One
bright spot at the start of 2001 was the IMF's offer of $13.7
billion in support.

cities; the major networks are entirely digital and the availability
of telephone service is being improved; however, telephone density
is presently minimal, and making telephone service universally
available will take some time

Armenia    Introduction

Background: An Orthodox Christian country, Armenia was incorporated
into Russia in 1828 and the USSR in 1920. Armenian leaders remain
preoccupied by the long conflict with Azerbaijan over
Nagorno-Karabakh, a primarily Armenian-populated exclave, assigned
to Soviet Azerbaijan in the 1920s by Moscow. Armenia and Azerbaijan
began fighting over the exclave in 1988; the struggle escalated
after both countries attained independence from the Soviet Union in
1991. By May 1994, when a cease-fire took hold, Armenian forces held
not only Nagorno-Karabakh but also a significant portion of
Azerbaijan proper. The economies of both sides have been hurt by
their inability to make substantial progress toward a peaceful
resolution.

Armenia    Economy

Economy - overview: Under the old Soviet central planning system,
Armenia had developed a modern industrial sector, supplying machine
tools, textiles, and other manufactured goods to sister republics in
exchange for raw materials and energy. Since the implosion of the
USSR in December 1991, Armenia has switched to small-scale
agriculture away from the large agroindustrial complexes of the
Soviet era. The agricultural sector has long-term needs for more
investment and updated technology. The privatization of industry has
been at a slower pace, but has been given renewed emphasis by the
current administration. Armenia is a food importer, and its mineral
deposits (gold, bauxite) are small. The ongoing conflict with
Azerbaijan over the ethnic Armenian-dominated region of
Nagorno-Karabakh and the breakup of the centrally directed economic
system of the former Soviet Union contributed to a severe economic
decline in the early 1990s. By 1994, however, the Armenian
Government had launched an ambitious IMF-sponsored economic program
that has resulted in positive growth rates in 1995-2000. Armenia
also managed to slash inflation and to privatize most small- and
medium-sized enterprises. The chronic energy shortages Armenia
suffered in recent years have been largely offset by the energy
supplied by one of its nuclear power plants at Metsamor. Armenia's
severe trade imbalance, importing three times its exports, has been
offset somewhat by international aid, domestic restructuring of the
economy, and foreign direct investment.

Aruba    Introduction

Background: Discovered and claimed for Spain in 1499, Aruba was
acquired by the Dutch in 1636. The island's economy has been
dominated by three main industries. A 19th century gold rush was
followed by prosperity brought on by the opening in 1924 of an oil
refinery. The last decades of the 20th century saw a boom in the
tourism industry. Aruba seceded from the Netherlands Antilles in
1986 and became a separate, autonomous member of the Kingdom of the
Netherlands. Movement toward full independence was halted at Aruba's
request in 1990.

Aruba    Economy

Economy - overview: Tourism is the mainstay of the Aruban economy,
although offshore banking and oil refining and storage are also
important. The rapid growth of the tourism sector over the last
decade has resulted in a substantial expansion of other activities.
Construction has boomed, with hotel capacity five times the 1985
level. In addition, the reopening of the country's oil refinery in
1993, a major source of employment and foreign exchange earnings,
has further spurred growth. Aruba's small labor force and less than
1% unemployment rate have led to a large number of unfilled job
vacancies, despite sharp rises in wage rates in recent years.

@Atlantic Ocean

Atlantic Ocean    Introduction Top of Page

Background: The Atlantic Ocean is the second-largest of the world's
five oceans (after the Pacific Ocean, but larger than the Indian
Ocean, Southern Ocean, and Arctic Ocean). The Kiel Canal (Germany),
Oresund (Denmark-Sweden), Bosporus (Turkey), Strait of Gibraltar
(Morocco-Spain), and the St. Lawrence Seaway (Canada-US) are
important strategic access waterways. The decision by the
International Hydrographic Organization in the spring of 2000 to
delimit a fifth world ocean, the Southern Ocean, removed the portion
of the Atlantic Ocean south of 60 degrees south.



Atlantic Ocean    Geography

Location: body of water between Africa, Europe, the Southern Ocean,
and the Western Hemisphere

Geographic coordinates: 0 00 N, 25 00 W

Map references: World

Area: total:  76.762 million sq km

note:  includes Baltic Sea, Black Sea, Caribbean Sea, Davis Strait,
Denmark Strait, part of the Drake Passage, Gulf of Mexico,
Mediterranean Sea, North Sea, Norwegian Sea, almost all of the
Scotia Sea, and other tributary water bodies

Area - comparative: slightly less than 6.5 times the size of the US

Coastline: 111,866 km

Climate: tropical cyclones (hurricanes) develop off the coast of
Africa near Cape Verde and move westward into the Caribbean Sea;
hurricanes can occur from May to December, but are most frequent
from August to November

Terrain: surface usually covered with sea ice in Labrador Sea,
Denmark Strait, and Baltic Sea from October to June; clockwise
warm-water gyre (broad, circular system of currents) in the northern
Atlantic, counterclockwise warm-water gyre in the southern Atlantic;
the ocean floor is dominated by the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a rugged
north-south centerline for the entire Atlantic basin

Elevation extremes: lowest point:  Milwaukee Deep in the Puerto Rico
Trench -8,605 m

highest point:  sea level 0 m

Natural resources: oil and gas fields, fish, marine mammals (seals
and whales), sand and gravel aggregates, placer deposits,
polymetallic nodules, precious stones

Natural hazards: icebergs common in Davis Strait, Denmark Strait,
and the northwestern Atlantic Ocean from February to August and have
been spotted as far south as Bermuda and the Madeira Islands; ships
subject to superstructure icing in extreme northern Atlantic from
October to May; persistent fog can be a maritime hazard from May to
September; hurricanes (May to December)

Environment - current issues: endangered marine species include the
manatee, seals, sea lions, turtles, and whales; drift net fishing is
hastening the decline of fish stocks and contributing to
international disputes; municipal sludge pollution off eastern US,
southern Brazil, and eastern Argentina; oil pollution in Caribbean
Sea, Gulf of Mexico, Lake Maracaibo, Mediterranean Sea, and North
Sea; industrial waste and municipal sewage pollution in Baltic Sea,
North Sea, and Mediterranean Sea

Geography - note: major chokepoints include the Dardanelles, Strait
of Gibraltar, access to the Panama and Suez Canals; strategic
straits include the Strait of Dover, Straits of Florida, Mona
Passage, The Sound (Oresund), and Windward Passage; the Equator
divides the Atlantic Ocean into the North Atlantic Ocean and South
Atlantic Ocean



Atlantic Ocean    Economy

Economy - overview: The Atlantic Ocean provides some of the world's
most heavily trafficked sea routes, between and within the Eastern
and Western Hemispheres. Other economic activity includes the
exploitation of natural resources, e.g., fishing, the dredging of
aragonite sands (The Bahamas), and production of crude oil and
natural gas (Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and North Sea).

@Australia




Australia    Introduction

Background: Australia became a commonwealth of the British Empire in
1901. It was able to take advantage of its natural resources to
rapidly develop its agricultural and manufacturing industries and to
make a major contribution to the British effort in World Wars I and
II. Long-term concerns include pollution, particularly depletion of
the ozone layer, and management and conservation of coastal areas,
especially the Great Barrier Reef. A referendum to change
Australia's status, from a commonwealth headed by the British
monarch to an independent republic, was defeated in 1999.

Australia    Economy

Economy - overview: Australia has a prosperous Western-style
capitalist economy, with a per capita GDP at the level of the four
dominant West European economies. Rich in natural resources,
Australia is a major exporter of agricultural products, minerals,
metals, and fossil fuels. Commodities account for 57% of the value
of total exports, so that a downturn in world commodity prices can
have a big impact on the economy. The government is pushing for
increased exports of manufactured goods, but competition in
international markets continues to be severe. While Australia has
suffered from the low growth and high unemployment characterizing
the OECD countries in the early 1990s and during the recent
financial problems in East Asia, the economy has expanded at a solid
4% annual growth pace in the last five years. Canberra's emphasis on
reforms is a key factor behind the economy's resilience to the
regional crisis and its stronger than expected growth rate. Growth
in 2001 will depend on key international commodity prices, the
extent of recovery in nearby Asian economies, and the strength of US
and European markets.

Austria    Introduction

Background: Once the center of power for the large Austro-Hungarian
Empire, Austria was reduced to a small republic after its defeat in
World War I. Following annexation by Nazi Germany in 1938 and
subsequent occupation by the victorious Allies, Austria's 1955 State
Treaty declared the country "permanently neutral" as a condition of
Soviet military withdrawal. Neutrality, once ingrained as part of
the Austrian cultural identity, has been called into question since
the Soviet collapse of 1991 and Austria's increasingly prominent
role in European affairs. A prosperous country, Austria joined the
European Union in 1995 and the euro monetary system in 1999.

Austria    Economy

Economy - overview: Austria with its well-developed market economy
and high standard of living is closely tied to other EU economies,
especially Germany's. Membership in the EU has drawn an influx of
foreign investors attracted by Austria's access to the single
European market and proximity to EU aspirant economies. In 2000,
Austria moved to further cut government spending and raise taxes to
meet EMU deficit targets after facing unexpected difficulties in
reducing the public deficit. To meet increased competition from both
EU and Central European countries, Austria will need to emphasize
knowledge-based sectors of the economy and continue to deregulate
the service sector. Growth is expected to remain at about 3% in 2001.

Azerbaijan    Introduction

Background: Azerbaijan - a nation of Turkic Muslims - has been an
independent republic since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Despite a cease-fire, in place since 1994, Azerbaijan has yet to
resolve its conflict with Armenia over the Azerbaijani
Nagorno-Karabakh enclave (largely Armenian populated). Azerbaijan
has lost almost 20% of its territory and must support some 750,000
refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) as a result of the
conflict. Corruption is ubiquitous and the promise of widespread
wealth from Azerbaijan's undeveloped petroleum resources remains
largely unfulfilled.



Azerbaijan    Geography

Location: Southwestern Asia, bordering the Caspian Sea, between Iran
and Russia

Geographic coordinates: 40 30 N, 47 30 E

Map references: Commonwealth of Independent States

Area: total:  86,600 sq km

land:  86,100 sq km

water:  500 sq km

note:  includes the exclave of Naxcivan Autonomous Republic and the
Nagorno-Karabakh region; the region's autonomy was abolished by
Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet on 26 November 1991

Area - comparative: slightly smaller than Maine

Land boundaries: total:  2,013 km

border countries:  Armenia (with Azerbaijan-proper) 566 km, Armenia
(with Azerbaijan-Naxcivan exclave) 221 km, Georgia 322 km, Iran
(with Azerbaijan-proper) 432 km, Iran (with Azerbaijan-Naxcivan
exclave) 179 km, Russia 284 km, Turkey 9 km

Coastline: 0 km (landlocked); note - Azerbaijan borders the Caspian
Sea (800 km, est.)

Maritime claims: none (landlocked)

Climate: dry, semiarid steppe

Terrain: large, flat Kur-Araz Ovaligi (Kura-Araks Lowland) (much of
it below sea level) with Great Caucasus Mountains to the north,
Qarabag Yaylasi (Karabakh Upland) in west; Baku lies on Abseron
Yasaqligi (Apsheron Peninsula) that juts into Caspian Sea

Elevation extremes: lowest point:  Caspian Sea -28 m

levels of the Caspian Sea

Environment - current issues: local scientists consider the Abseron
Yasaqligi (Apsheron Peninsula) (including Baku and Sumqayit) and the
Caspian Sea to be the ecologically most devastated area in the world
because of severe air, water, and soil pollution; soil pollution
results from the use of DDT as a pesticide and also from toxic
defoliants used in the production of cotton

Environment - international agreements: party to:  Biodiversity,
Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification,

Azerbaijan    Economy

Economy - overview: Azerbaijan's most prominent products are oil,
cotton, and natural gas. Azerbaijan's oil production declined
through 1997 but has registered an increase every year since.
Negotiation of 19 production-sharing arrangements (PSAs) with
foreign firms, which have thus far committed $60 billion to oil
field development, should generate the funds needed to spur future
industrial development. Oil production under the first of these
PSAs, with the Azerbaijan International Operating Company, began in
November 1997. Azerbaijan shares all the formidable problems of the
former Soviet republics in making the transition from a command to a
market economy, but its considerable energy resources brighten its
long-term prospects. Baku has only recently begun making progress on
economic reform, and old economic ties and structures are slowly
being replaced. An obstacle to economic progress, including stepped
up foreign investment, is the continuing conflict with Armenia over
the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Trade with Russia and the other former
Soviet republics is declining in importance while trade is building
up with Turkey, Iran, UAE, and the nations of Europe. Long-term
prospects will depend on world oil prices, the location of new
pipelines in the region, and Azerbaijan's ability to manage its oil
wealth.

Bahamas, The    Economy

Economy - overview: The Bahamas is a stable, developing nation with
an economy heavily dependent on tourism and offshore banking.
Tourism alone accounts for more than 60% of GDP and directly or
indirectly employs 40% of the archipelago's labor force. Moderate
growth in tourism receipts and a boom in construction of new hotels,
resorts, and residences led to an increase of the country's GDP by
an estimated 3% in 1998, 6% in 1999, and 4.5% in 2000. Manufacturing
and agriculture together contribute only 10% of GDP and show little
growth, despite government incentives aimed at those sectors.
Overall growth prospects in the short run will depend heavily on the
fortunes of the tourism sector and continued sturdy growth in the
US, which accounts for the majority of tourist visitors.

Bahrain    Introduction

Background: Bahrain's small size and central location among Persian
Gulf countries require it to play a delicate balancing act in
foreign affairs among its larger neighbors. Possessing minimal oil
reserves, Bahrain has turned to petroleum processing and refining,
and has transformed itself into an international banking center. The
new amir is pushing economic and political reforms, and has worked
to improve relations with the Shi'a community. In 2001, the
International Court of Justice awarded the Hawar Islands, long
disputed with Qatar, to Bahrain.

account for about 60% of export receipts, 60% of government
revenues, and 30% of GDP. With its highly developed communication
and transport facilities, Bahrain is home to numerous multinational
firms with business in the Gulf. Bahrain is dependent on Saudi
Arabia for oil revenue granted as aid. A large share of exports
consists of petroleum products made from imported crude.
Construction proceeds on several major industrial projects.
Unemployment, especially among the young, and the depletion of both
oil and underground water resources are major long-term economic
problems.

@Baker Island




Baker Island    Introduction

Background: The US took possession of the island in 1857, and its
guano deposits were mined by US and British companies during the
second half of the 19th century. In 1935, a short-lived attempt at
colonization was begun on this island - as well as on nearby Howland
Island - but was disrupted by World War II and thereafter abandoned.
Presently the island is a National Wildlife Refuge run by the US
Department of the Interior; a day beacon is situated near the middle
of the west coast.

Bangladesh    Economy

Economy - overview: Despite sustained domestic and international
efforts to improve economic and demographic prospects, Bangladesh
remains one of the world's poorest, most densely populated, and
least developed nations. Although more than half of GDP is generated
through the service sector, nearly two-thirds of Bangladeshis are
employed in the agriculture sector, with rice as the single most
important product. Major impediments to growth include frequent
cyclones and floods, inefficient state-owned enterprises, inadequate
port facilities, a rapidly growing labor force that cannot be
absorbed by agriculture, delays in exploiting energy resources
(natural gas), insufficient power supplies, and slow implementation
of economic reforms. Reform is stalled in many instances by
political infighting and corruption at all levels of government.
Even so, Prime Minister Sheikh HASINA's Awami League government has
made some headway improving the climate for foreign investors and
liberalizing the capital markets. Progress on other economic reforms
has been halting because of opposition from the bureaucracy, public
sector unions, and other vested interest groups.

Barbados    Economy

Economy - overview: Historically, the Barbadian economy had been
dependent on sugarcane cultivation and related activities, but
production in recent years has diversified into manufacturing and
tourism. The start of the Port Charles Marina project in
Speightstown helped the tourism industry continue to expand in
1996-2000. Offshore finance and information services are important
foreign exchange earners, and there is also a light manufacturing
sector. The government continues its efforts to reduce unemployment,
encourage direct foreign investment, and privatize remaining
state-owned enterprises. Growth should remain steady in 2001, with
new tourist facilities a plus factor.

Belarus    Economy

Economy - overview: Belarus has seen little structural reform since
1995, when President LUKASHENKO launched the country on the path of
"market socialism." In keeping with this policy, LUKASHENKO
reimposed administrative controls over prices and currency exchange
rates and expanded the state's right to intervene in the management
of private enterprise. In addition to the burdens imposed by
extremely high inflation, businesses have been subject to pressure
on the part of central and local governments, e.g., arbitrary
changes in regulations, numerous rigorous inspections, and
retroactive application of new business regulations prohibiting
practices that had been legal. Further economic problems are two
consecutive bad harvests, 1998-99, and persistent trade deficits.
Close relations with Russia, possibly leading to reunion, color the
pattern of economic developments. For the time being, Belarus
remains self-isolated from the West and its open-market economies.

and was occupied by Germany during World Wars I and II. It has
prospered in the past half century as a modern, technologically
advanced European state and member of NATO and the EU. Tensions
between the Dutch-speaking Flemings of the north and the
French-speaking Walloons of the south have led in recent years to
constitutional amendments granting these regions formal recognition
and autonomy.

Belgium    Economy

Economy - overview: This modern private enterprise economy has
capitalized on its central geographic location, highly developed
transport network, and diversified industrial and commercial base.
Industry is concentrated mainly in the populous Flemish area in the
north, although the government is encouraging investment in the
southern region of Wallonia. With few natural resources, Belgium
must import substantial quantities of raw materials and export a
large volume of manufactures, making its economy unusually dependent
on the state of world markets. About three-quarters of its trade is
with other EU countries. Belgium's public debt is expected to fall
below 100% of GDP in 2002, and the government has succeeded in
balancing is budget. Belgium became a charter member of the European
Monetary Union (EMU) in January 1999. Economic growth in 2000 was
broad based, putting the government in a good position to pursue its
energy market liberalization policies and planned tax cuts.

Belize    Economy

Economy - overview: The small, essentially private enterprise
economy is based primarily on agriculture, agro-based industry, and
merchandising, with tourism and construction assuming greater
importance. Sugar, the chief crop, accounts for nearly half of
exports, while the banana industry is the country's largest
employer. The government's tough austerity program in 1997 resulted
in an economic slowdown that continued in 1998. The trade deficit
has been growing, mostly as a result of low export prices for sugar
and bananas. The tourist and construction sectors strengthened in
early 1999, supporting growth of 6% in 1999 and 4% in 2000. Aided by
international donors, the government's key short-term objective
remains the reduction of poverty.

Benin    Economy

Economy - overview: The economy of Benin remains underdeveloped and
dependent on subsistence agriculture, cotton production, and
regional trade. Growth in real output averaged a sound 5% in
1996-99, but a rapid population rise offset much of this growth.
Inflation has subsided over the past several years. Commercial and
transport activities, which make up a large part of GDP, are
vulnerable to developments in Nigeria, particularly fuel shortages.
The Paris Club and bilateral creditors have eased the external debt
situation in recent years. While high fuel prices constrained growth
in 2000, increased cotton production - enabled by a major
restructuring program - and an expansion of the Cotonou port, may
lead to increased growth in 2001.

Bermuda    Economy

Economy - overview: Bermuda enjoys one of the highest per capita
incomes in the world, having successfully exploited its location by
providing financial services for international firms and luxury
tourist facilities for 360,000 visitors annually. The tourist
industry, which accounts for an estimated 28% of GDP, attracts 84%
of its business from North America. The industrial sector is small,
and agriculture is severely limited by a lack of suitable land.
About 80% of food needs are imported. International business
contributes over 60% of Bermuda's economic output; a failed
independence vote in late 1995 can be partially attributed to
Bermudian fears of scaring away foreign firms. Government economic
priorities are the further strengthening of the tourist and
international financial sectors.

GDP: purchasing power parity - $2.1 billion (2000 est.)

GDP - real growth rate: 1.5% (2000 est.)

GDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $33,000 (2000 est.)

Bhutan    Introduction

Background: Under British influence a monarchy was set up in 1907;
three years later a treaty was signed whereby the country became a
British protectorate. Independence was attained in 1949, with India
subsequently guiding foreign relations and supplying aid. A refugee
issue of some 100,000 Bhutanese in Nepal remains unresolved; 90% of
these displaced persons are housed in seven United Nations Office of
the High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) camps. Maoist Assamese
separatists from India, who have established themselves in the
southeast portion of Bhutan, have drawn Indian cross-border
incursions.

Bhutan    Economy

Economy - overview: The economy, one of the world's smallest and
least developed, is based on agriculture and forestry, which provide
the main livelihood for more than 90% of the population. Agriculture
consists largely of subsistence farming and animal husbandry. Rugged
mountains dominate the terrain and make the building of roads and
other infrastructure difficult and expensive. The economy is closely
aligned with India's through strong trade and monetary links. The
industrial sector is technologically backward, with most production
of the cottage industry type. Most development projects, such as
road construction, rely on Indian migrant labor. Bhutan's hydropower
potential and its attraction for tourists are key resources. The
Bhutanese Government has made some progress in expanding the
nation's productive base and improving social welfare. Model
education, social, and environment programs in Bhutan are underway
with support from multilateral development organizations. Each
economic program takes into account the government's desire to
protect the country's environment and cultural traditions. Detailed
controls and uncertain policies in areas like industrial licensing,
trade, labor, and finance continue to hamper foreign investment.

Bolivia    Introduction

Background: Bolivia, named after independence fighter Simon BOLIVAR,
broke away from Spanish rule in 1825; much of its subsequent history
has consisted of a series of nearly 200 coups and counter-coups.
Comparatively democratic civilian rule was established in the 1980s,
but leaders have faced difficult problems of deep-seated poverty,
social unrest, and drug production. Current goals include attracting
foreign investment, strengthening the educational system, continuing
the privatization program, and waging an anti-corruption campaign.

Bolivia    Economy

Economy - overview: Bolivia, long one of the poorest and least
developed Latin American countries, has made considerable progress
toward the development of a market-oriented economy. Successes under
President SANCHEZ DE LOZADA (1993-97) included the signing of a free
trade agreement with Mexico and joining the Southern Cone Common
Market (Mercosur), as well as the privatization of the state
airline, telephone company, railroad, electric power company, and
oil company. His successor, Hugo BANZER Suarez has tried to further
improve the country's investment climate with an anticorruption
campaign. Growth slowed in 1999, in part due to tight government
budget policies, which limited needed appropriations for
anti-poverty programs, and the fallout from the Asian financial
crisis. In 2000, major civil disturbances in April, and again in
September and October, held down overall growth to 2.5%.

GDP: purchasing power parity - $20.9 billion (2000 est.)

@Bosnia and Herzegovina




Bosnia and Herzegovina    Introduction

Background: Bosnia and Herzegovina's declaration of sovereignty in
October 1991, was followed by a referendum for independence from the
former Yugoslavia in February 1992. The Bosnian Serbs - supported by
neighboring Serbia - responded with armed resistance aimed at
partitioning the republic along ethnic lines and joining Serb-held
areas to form a "greater Serbia." In March 1994, Bosniaks and Croats
reduced the number of warring factions from three to two by signing
an agreement creating a joint Bosniak/Croat Federation of Bosnia and
Herzegovina. On 21 November 1995, in Dayton, Ohio, the warring
parties signed a peace agreement that brought to a halt the three
years of interethnic civil strife (the final agreement was signed in
Paris on 14 December 1995). The Dayton Agreement retained Bosnia and
Herzegovina's international boundaries and created a joint
multi-ethnic and democratic government. This national government is
charged with conducting foreign, economic, and fiscal policy. Also
recognized was a second tier of government comprised of two entities
roughly equal in size: the Bosniak/Croat Federation of Bosnia and
Herzegovina and the Bosnian Serb-led Republika Srpska (RS). The
Federation and RS governments are charged with overseeing internal
functions. In 1995-96, a NATO-led international peacekeeping force
(IFOR) of 60,000 troops served in Bosnia to implement and monitor
the military aspects of the agreement. IFOR was succeeded by a
smaller, NATO-led Stabilization Force (SFOR) whose mission is to
deter renewed hostilities. SFOR remains in place at a level of
approximately 21,000 troops.

Government - note: The Dayton Agreement, signed in Paris on 14
December 1995, retained Bosnia and Herzegovina's exterior border and
created a joint multi-ethnic and democratic government. This
national government - based on proportional representation similar
to that which existed in the former socialist regime - is charged
with conducting foreign, economic, and fiscal policy. The Dayton
Agreement also recognized a second tier of government, comprised of
two entities - a joint Bosniak/Croat Federation of Bosnia and
Herzegovina and the Bosnian Serb Republika Srpska (RS) - each
presiding over roughly one-half the territory. The Federation and RS
governments are charged with overseeing internal functions. The
Dayton Agreement established the Office of the High Representative
(OHR) to oversee the implementation of the civilian aspects of the
agreement. About 250 international and 450 local staff members are
employed by the OHR.



Bosnia and Herzegovina    Economy

Economy - overview: Bosnia and Herzegovina ranked next to The Former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as the poorest republic in the old
Yugoslav federation. Although agriculture is almost all in private
hands, farms are small and inefficient, and the republic
traditionally is a net importer of food. Industry has been greatly
overstaffed, one reflection of the socialist economic structure of
Yugoslavia. TITO had pushed the development of military industries
in the republic with the result that Bosnia hosted a large share of
Yugoslavia's defense plants. The bitter interethnic warfare in
Bosnia caused production to plummet by 80% from 1990 to 1995,
unemployment to soar, and human misery to multiply. With an uneasy
peace in place, output recovered in 1996-98 at high percentage rates
from a low base; but output growth slowed appreciably in 1999 and
2000, and GDP remains far below the 1990 level. Economic data are of
limited use because, although both entities issue figures,
national-level statistics are not available. Moreover, official data
do not capture the large share of activity that occurs on the black
market. The marka - the national currency introduced in 1998 - has
gained wide acceptance, and the Central Bank of Bosnia and
Herzegovina has dramatically increased its reserve holdings.
Implementation of privatization, however, has been slower than
anticipated. Banking reform accelerated in early 2001 as all the
communist-era payments bureaus were shut down. The country receives
substantial amounts of reconstruction assistance and humanitarian
aid from the international community but will have to prepare for an
era of declining assistance.

Botswana    Economy

Economy - overview: Botswana has maintained one of the world's
highest growth rates since independence in 1966. Through fiscal
discipline and sound management, Botswana has transformed itself
from one of the poorest countries in the world to a middle-income
country with a per capita GDP of $6,600 in 2000. Diamond mining has
fueled much of Botswana's economic expansion and currently accounts
for more than one-third of GDP and for three-fourths of export
earnings. Tourism, subsistence farming, and cattle raising are other
key sectors. The government must deal with high rates of
unemployment and poverty. Unemployment officially is 19%, but
unofficial estimates place it closer to 40%. HIV/AIDS infection
rates are the highest in the world and threaten Botswana's
impressive economic gains.

@Bouvet Island





Bouvet Island    Introduction

Background: This uninhabited volcanic island is almost entirely
covered by glaciers and is difficult to approach. It was discovered
in 1739 by a French naval officer after whom the island was named.
No claim was made until 1825 when the British flag was raised. In
1928, the UK waived its claim in favor of Norway, which had occupied
the island the previous year. In 1971, Bouvet Island and the
adjacent territorial waters were designated a nature reserve. Since
1977, Norway has run an automated meteorological station on the
island.

Brazil    Introduction

Background: Following three centuries under the rule of Portugal,
Brazil became an independent nation in 1822. By far the largest and
most populous country in South America, Brazil has overcome more
than half a century of military intervention in the governance of
the country to pursue industrial and agricultural growth and
development of the interior. Exploiting vast natural resources and a
large labor pool, Brazil became Latin America's leading economic
power by the 1970s. Highly unequal income distribution remains a
pressing problem.

Brazil    Economy

Economy - overview: Possessing large and well-developed
agricultural, mining, manufacturing, and service sectors, Brazil's
economy outweighs that of all other South American countries and is
expanding its presence in world markets. In the late eighties and
early nineties, high inflation hindered economic activity and
investment. "The Real Plan", instituted in the spring of 1994,
sought to break inflationary expectations by pegging the real to the
US dollar. Inflation was brought down to single digit annual
figures, but not fast enough to avoid substantial real exchange rate
appreciation during the transition phase of the "Real Plan". This
appreciation meant that Brazilian goods were now more expensive
relative to goods from other countries, which contributed to large
current account deficits. However, no shortage of foreign currency
ensued because of the financial community's renewed interest in
Brazilian markets as inflation rates stabilized and the debt crisis
of the eighties faded from memory. The maintenance of large current
account deficits via capital account surpluses became problematic as
investors became more risk averse to emerging market exposure as a
consequence of the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and the Russian
bond default in August 1998. After crafting a fiscal adjustment
program and pledging progress on structural reform, Brazil received
a $41.5 billion IMF-led international support program in November
1998. In January 1999, the Brazilian Central Bank announced that the
real would no longer be pegged to the US dollar. This devaluation
helped moderate the downturn in economic growth in 1999 that
investors had expressed concerns about over the summer of 1998.
Brazil's debt to GDP ratio for 1999 beat the IMF target and helped
reassure investors that Brazil will maintain tight fiscal and
monetary policy even with a floating currency. The economy continued
to recover in 2000, with inflation remaining in the single digits
and expected growth for 2001 of 4.5%. Foreign direct investment set
a record of more than $30 billion in 2000.

@British Indian Ocean Territory





British Indian Ocean Territory    Introduction

Background: Established as a territory of the UK in 1965, a number
of the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) islands were
transferred to the Seychelles when it attained independence in 1976.
Subsequently, BIOT has consisted only of the six main island groups
comprising the Chagos Archipelago. The largest and most southerly of
the islands, Diego Garcia, contains a joint UK-US naval support
facility. All of the remaining islands are uninhabited. Former
agricultural workers, earlier resident in the islands, were
relocated primarily to Mauritius but also to the Seychelles, between
1967 and 1973. In 2000, a British High Court ruling invalidated the
local immigration order which had excluded them from the
archipelago, but upheld the special military status of Diego Garcia.

British Virgin Islands    Economy

Economy - overview: The economy, one of the most stable and
prosperous in the Caribbean, is highly dependent on tourism, which
generates an estimated 45% of the national income. An estimated
350,000 tourists, mainly from the US, visited the islands in 1997.
In the mid-1980s, the government began offering offshore
registration to companies wishing to incorporate in the islands, and
incorporation fees now generate substantial revenues. An estimated
250,000 companies were on the offshore registry by yearend 1997. The
adoption of a comprehensive insurance law in late 1994, which
provides a blanket of confidentiality with regulated statutory
gateways for investigation of criminal offenses, is expected to make
the British Virgin Islands even more attractive to international
business. Livestock raising is the most important agricultural
activity; poor soils limit the islands' ability to meet domestic
food requirements. Because of traditionally close links with the US
Virgin Islands, the British Virgin Islands has used the dollar as
its currency since 1959.

@Brunei




Brunei    Introduction

Background: The Sultanate of Brunei's heyday occurred between the
15th and 17th centuries, when its control extended over coastal
areas of northwest Borneo and the southern Philippines. Brunei
subsequently entered a period of decline brought on by internal
strife over royal succession, colonial expansion of European powers,
and piracy. In 1888, Brunei became a British protectorate;
independence was achieved in 1984. Brunei benefits from extensive
petroleum and natural gas fields, the source of one of the highest
per capita GDPs in the less developed countries. The same family has
now ruled in Brunei for over six centuries.

Brunei    Economy

Economy - overview: This small, wealthy economy is a mixture of
foreign and domestic entrepreneurship, government regulation and
welfare measures, and village tradition. Exports of crude oil and
natural gas account for over half of GDP. Per capita GDP is far
above most other Third World countries, and substantial income from
overseas investment supplements income from domestic production. The
government provides for all medical services and subsidizes rice and
housing. Brunei's leaders are concerned that steadily increased
integration in the world economy will undermine internal social
cohesion although it became a more prominent player by serving as
chairman for the 2000 APEC (Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation)
forum. Plans for the future include upgrading the labor force,
reducing unemployment, strengthening the banking and tourist
sectors, and, in general, a further widening of the economic base
beyond oil and gas.

Bulgaria    Introduction

Background: Bulgaria earned its independence from the Ottoman Empire
in 1878, but having fought on the losing side in both World Wars, it
fell within the Soviet sphere of influence and became a People's
Republic in 1946. Communist domination ended in 1990, when Bulgaria
held its first multi-party election since World War II and began the
contentious process of moving toward political democracy and a
market economy while combating inflation, unemployment, corruption,
and crime. Today, reforms and democratization keep Bulgaria on a
path toward eventual integration into NATO and the EU - with which
it began accession negotiations in 2000.

Bulgaria    Economy

Economy - overview: Bulgaria, a former communist country struggling
to enter the European market economy, suffered a major economic
downturn in 1996 and 1997, with triple digit inflation and GDP
contraction of 10.6% and 6.9%. The current government - which took
office in May 1997 after pre-term parliamentary elections -
stabilized the economy and promoted growth by implementing a
currency board, practicing sound financial policies, invigorating
privatization, and pursuing structural reforms. Additionally, strong
assistance from international financial institutions - most notably
the IMF which approved a three-year Extended Fund Facility worth
approximately $900 million in September 1998 - played a critical
role in turning the economy around. After several years of tumult,
Bulgaria's economy has stabilized. Its better-than-expected economic
performance in 1999 - despite the impact of the Kosovo conflict, the
1998 Russian financial crisis, and structural reforms - and strong
growth in 2000 portends solid growth over the next few years; this
assumes continued fiscal restraint, additional structural reforms,
aid from abroad, and prosperous times in the EU economy.

Burma    Economy

Economy - overview: Burma has a mixed economy with private activity
dominant in agriculture, light industry, and transport, and with
substantial state-controlled activity, mainly in energy, heavy
industry, and the rice trade. Government policy in the 1990s has
aimed at revitalizing the economy after three decades of tight
central planning. Private activity markedly increased in the early
to mid-1990s, but began to decline in the past several years due to
frustrations with the unfriendly business environment and political
pressure from western nations. Published estimates of Burma's
foreign trade are greatly understated because of the volume of
black-market, illicit, and border trade. A major ongoing problem is
the failure to achieve monetary and fiscal stability. Burma remains
a poor Asian country and living standards for the majority have not
improved over the past decade. Short-term growth will continue to be
restrained because of poor government planning and minimal foreign
investment.

after Afghanistan (potential production in 1999 - 1,090 metric tons,
down 38% due to drought; cultivation in 1999 - 89,500 hectares, a
31% decline from 1998); surrender of drug warlord KHUN SA's Mong Tai
Army in January 1996 was hailed by Rangoon as a major
counternarcotics success, but lack of government will and ability to
take on major narcotrafficking groups and lack of serious commitment
against money laundering continues to hinder the overall antidrug
effort; becoming a major source of methamphetamine for regional
consumption

Burundi    Introduction

Background: Between 1993 and 2000, wide-spread, often intense ethnic
violence between Hutu and Tutsi factions in Burundi created hundreds
of thousands of refugees and left tens of thousands dead. Although
some refugees have returned from neighboring countries, continued
ethnic strife has forced many others to flee. Burundian troops,
seeking to secure their borders, have intervened in the conflict in
the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Burundi    Economy

Economy - overview: Burundi is a landlocked, resource-poor country
with an underdeveloped manufacturing sector. The economy is
predominantly agricultural with roughly 90% of the population
dependent on subsistence agriculture. Its economic health depends on
the coffee crop, which accounts for 80% of foreign exchange
earnings. The ability to pay for imports therefore rests largely on
the vagaries of the climate and the international coffee market.
Since October 1993 the nation has suffered from massive ethnic-based
violence which has resulted in the death of perhaps 250,000 persons
and the displacement of about 800,000 others. Only one in four
children go to school, and one in nine adults has HIV/AIDS. Foods,
medicines, and electricity remain in short supply.

Cambodia    Introduction

Background: Following a five-year struggle, communist Khmer Rouge
forces captured Phnom Penh in 1975 and ordered the evacuation of all
cities and towns; over 1 million displaced people died from
execution or enforced hardships. A 1978 Vietnamese invasion drove
the Khmer Rouge into the countryside and touched off 13 years of
fighting. UN-sponsored elections in 1993 helped restore some
semblance of normalcy, as did the rapid diminishment of the Khmer
Rouge in the mid-1990s. A coalition government, formed after
national elections in 1998, brought renewed political stability and
the surrender of remaining Khmer Rouge forces.

Cambodia    Economy

Economy - overview: Cambodia's economy slowed dramatically in
1997-98 due to the regional economic crisis, civil violence, and
political infighting. Foreign investment and tourism fell off. In
1999, the first full year of peace in 30 years, progress was made on
economic reforms and growth resumed at 4%. GDP growth for 2000 had
been projected to reach 5.5%, but the worst flooding in 70 years
severely damaged agricultural crops, and high oil prices hurt
industrial production, and growth for the year is estimated at only
4%. Tourism is Cambodia's fastest growing industry, with arrivals up
34% in 2000. The long-term development of the economy after decades
of war remains a daunting challenge. The population lacks education
and productive skills, particularly in the poverty-ridden
countryside, which suffers from an almost total lack of basic
infrastructure. Fear of renewed political instability and corruption
within the government discourage foreign investment and delay
foreign aid. On the brighter side, the government is addressing
these issues with assistance from bilateral and multilateral donors.

Cameroon    Economy

Economy - overview: Because of its oil resources and favorable
agricultural conditions, Cameroon has one of the best-endowed
primary commodity economies in sub-Saharan Africa. Still, it faces
many of the serious problems facing other underdeveloped countries,
such as a top-heavy civil service and a generally unfavorable
climate for business enterprise. Since 1990, the government has
embarked on various IMF and World Bank programs designed to spur
business investment, increase efficiency in agriculture, improve
trade, and recapitalize the nation's banks. In June 2000, the
government completed an IMF-sponsored, three-year structural
adjustment program; however, the IMF is pressing for more reforms,
including increased budget transparency and privatization. Higher
oil prices in 2000 helped to offset the country's lower cocoa export
revenues. A rebound in the cocoa market should increase growth to
over 5% in 2001.

Canada    Introduction

Background: A land of vast distances and rich natural resources,
Canada became a self-governing dominion in 1867 while retaining ties
to the British crown. Economically and technologically the nation
has developed in parallel with the US, its neighbor to the south
across an unfortified border. Its paramount political problem
continues to be the relationship of the province of Quebec, with its
French-speaking residents and unique culture, to the remainder of
the country.

Canada    Economy

Economy - overview: As an affluent, high-tech industrial society,
Canada today closely resembles the US in its market-oriented
economic system, pattern of production, and high living standards.
Since World War II, the impressive growth of the manufacturing,
mining, and service sectors has transformed the nation from a
largely rural economy into one primarily industrial and urban. Real
rates of growth have averaged nearly 3.0% since 1993. Unemployment
is falling and government budget surpluses are being partially
devoted to reducing the large public sector debt. The 1989 US-Canada
Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and 1994 North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA) (which included Mexico) have touched off a
dramatic increase in trade and economic integration with the US.
With its great natural resources, skilled labor force, and modern
capital plant Canada enjoys solid economic prospects. Two shadows
loom, the first being the continuing constitutional impasse between
English- and French-speaking areas, which has been raising the
possibility of a split in the federation. Another long-term concern
is the flow south to the US of professional persons lured by higher
pay, lower taxes, and the immense high-tech infrastructure.

Cape Verde    Economy

Economy - overview: Cape Verde's low per capita GDP reflects a poor
natural resource base, including serious water shortages exacerbated
by cycles of long-term drought. The economy is service-oriented,
with commerce, transport, and public services accounting for almost
70% of GDP. Although nearly 70% of the population lives in rural
areas, the share of agriculture in GDP in 1998 was only 13%, of
which fishing accounts for 1.5%. About 90% of food must be imported.
The fishing potential, mostly lobster and tuna, is not fully
exploited. Cape Verde annually runs a high trade deficit, financed
by foreign aid and remittances from emigrants; remittances
constitute a supplement to GDP of more than 20%. Economic reforms,
launched by the new democratic government in 1991, are aimed at
developing the private sector and attracting foreign investment to
diversify the economy. Prospects for 2001 depend heavily on the
maintenance of aid flows, remittances, and the momentum of the
government's development program.

Central African Republic    Economy

Economy - overview: Subsistence agriculture, together with forestry,
remains the backbone of the economy of the Central African Republic
(CAR), with more than 70% of the population living in outlying
areas. The agricultural sector generates half of GDP. Timber has
accounted for about 16% of export earnings and the diamond industry
for nearly 54%. Important constraints to economic development
include the CAR's landlocked position, a poor transportation system,
a largely unskilled work force, and a legacy of misdirected
macroeconomic policies. The 50% devaluation of the currencies of 14
Francophone African nations on 12 January 1994 had mixed effects on
the CAR's economy. Diamond, timber, coffee, and cotton exports
increased, leading an estimated rise of GDP of 7% in 1994 and nearly
5% in 1995. Military rebellions and social unrest in 1996 were
accompanied by widespread destruction of property and a drop in GDP
of 2%. The IMF approved an Extended Structure Adjustment Facility in
1998 and the World Bank extended further credits in 1999 and
approved a $10 million loan in early 2001. The government has set
targets of 3.5% GDP growth in 2001 and 2002. As of January 2001,
many civil servants were owed as much as 30 months pay, leading them
to go on strike and further damaging the economy.

Chad    Introduction

Background: Chad, part of France's African holdings until 1960,
endured three decades of ethnic warfare as well as invasions by
Libya before a semblance of peace was finally restored in 1990. The
government eventually suppressed or came to terms with most
political-military groups, settled a territorial dispute with Libya
on terms favorable to Chad, drafted a democratic constitution, and
held multiparty presidential and National Assembly elections in 1996
and 1997 respectively. In 1998 a new rebellion broke out in northern
Chad, which continued to escalate throughout 2000. Despite movement
toward democratic reform, power remains in the hands of a northern
ethnic oligarchy.

Chad    Economy

Economy - overview: Landlocked Chad's economic development suffers
from its geographic remoteness, drought, lack of infrastructure, and
political turmoil. About 85% of the population depends on
agriculture, including the herding of livestock. Of Africa's
Francophone countries, Chad benefited least from the 50% devaluation
of their currencies in January 1994. Financial aid from the World
Bank, the African Development Fund, and other sources is directed
largely at the improvement of agriculture, especially livestock
production. The World Bank's decision to back the Doba oil field
development and the Chad-Cameroon pipeline will add Chad to the
group of already booming West African oil exporters. However, the
rank and file may not benefit much from the oil development projects.

Chile    Introduction

Background: A three-year-old Marxist government was overthrown in
1973 by a dictatorial military regime led by Augusto PINOCHET, which
ruled until a freely elected president was installed in 1990. Sound
economic policies, first implemented by the PINOCHET dictatorship,
led to unprecedented growth in 1991-97 and have helped secure the
country's commitment to democratic and representative government.
Growth slowed in 1998-99, but recovered strongly in 2000.

Chile    Economy

Economy - overview: Chile has a market-oriented economy
characterized by a high level of foreign trade. During the early
1990s, Chile's reputation as a role model for economic reform was
strengthened when the democratic government of Patricio AYLWIN -
which took over from the military in 1990 - deepened the economic
reform initiated by the military government. Growth in real GDP
averaged 8% during 1991-97, but fell to half that level in 1998
because of tight monetary policies implemented to keep the current
account deficit in check and lower export earnings - the latter a
product of the global financial crisis. A severe drought exacerbated
the recession in 1999, reducing crop yields and causing
hydroelectric shortfalls and electricity rationing, and Chile
experienced negative economic growth for the first time in more than
15 years. Despite the effects of the recession, Chile maintained its
reputation for strong financial institutions and sound policy that
have given it the strongest sovereign bond rating in South America.
By the end of 1999, exports and economic activity had begun to
recover, and growth rebounded to 5.5% in 2000. Unemployment remains
stubbornly high, however, putting pressure on President LAGOS to
improve living standards. Meanwhile, Chile has launched free trade
negotiations with the US.

China    Introduction

Background: For centuries China has stood as a leading civilization,
outpacing the rest of the world in the arts and sciences. But in the
first half of the 20th century, China was beset by major famines,
civil unrest, military defeats, and foreign occupation. After World
War II, the Communists under MAO Zedong established a dictatorship
that, while ensuring China's sovereignty, imposed strict controls
over everyday life and cost the lives of tens of millions of people.
After 1978, his successor DENG Xiaoping gradually introduced
market-oriented reforms and decentralized economic decision making.
Output quadrupled in the next 20 years and China now has the world's
second largest GDP. Political controls remain tight even while
economic controls continue to weaken.

China    Economy

Economy - overview: In late 1978 the Chinese leadership began moving
the economy from a sluggish Soviet-style centrally planned economy
to a more market-oriented system. Whereas the system operates within
a political framework of strict Communist control, the economic
influence of non-state managers and enterprises has been steadily
increasing. The authorities have switched to a system of household
responsibility in agriculture in place of the old collectivization,
increased the authority of local officials and plant managers in
industry, permitted a wide variety of small-scale enterprise in
services and light manufacturing, and opened the economy to
increased foreign trade and investment. The result has been a
quadrupling of GDP since 1978. In 2000, with its 1.26 billion people
but a GDP of just $3,600 per capita, China stood as the second
largest economy in the world after the US (measured on a purchasing
power parity basis). Agricultural output doubled in the 1980s, and
industry also posted major gains, especially in coastal areas near
Hong Kong and opposite Taiwan, where foreign investment helped spur
output of both domestic and export goods. On the darker side, the
leadership has often experienced in its hybrid system the worst
results of socialism (bureaucracy and lassitude) and of capitalism
(windfall gains and stepped-up inflation). Beijing thus has
periodically backtracked, retightening central controls at
intervals. The government has struggled to (a) collect revenues due
from provinces, businesses, and individuals; (b) reduce corruption
and other economic crimes; and (c) keep afloat the large state-owned
enterprises many of which had been shielded from competition by
subsides and had been losing the ability to pay full wages and
pensions. From 80 to 120 million surplus rural workers are adrift
between the villages and the cities, many subsisting through
part-time low-paying jobs. Popular resistance, changes in central
policy, and loss of authority by rural cadres have weakened China's
population control program, which is essential to maintaining growth
in living standards. Another long-term threat to continued rapid
economic growth is the deterioration in the environment, notably air
pollution, soil erosion, and the steady fall of the water table
especially in the north. China continues to lose arable land because
of erosion and economic development. Weakness in the global economy
in 2001 could hamper growth in exports. Beijing will intensify
efforts to stimulate growth through spending on infrastructure--such
as water control and power grids--and poverty relief and through
rural tax reform aimed at eliminating arbitrary local levies on
farmers.

@Christmas Island





Christmas Island    Introduction

Background: Named in 1643 for the day of its discovery, the island
was annexed and settlement was begun by the UK in 1888. Phosphate
mining began in the 1890s. The UK transferred sovereignty to
Australia in 1958. The phosphate mine, closed in 1987, was reopened
four years later, but the need for an alternative industry has
spurred investment in tourism. Old mining areas are being restored,
and almost two-thirds of the island has been declared a national
park.

@Colombia




Colombia    Introduction

Background: Colombia was one of the three countries that emerged
from the collapse of Gran Colombia in 1830 (the others being Ecuador
and Venezuela). A 40-year insurgent campaign to overthrow the
Colombian Government escalated during the 1990s, undergirded in part
by funds from the drug trade. Although the violence is deadly and
large swaths of the countryside are under guerrilla influence, the
movement lacks the military strength or popular support necessary to
overthrow the government. While Bogota continues to try to negotiate
a settlement, neighboring countries worry about the violence
spilling over their borders.

Colombia    Economy

Economy - overview: Colombia is poised for muted growth in the next
several years, marking continued recovery from the severe 1999
recession when GDP fell by about 4%. President PASTRANA's
well-respected economic team is working to keep the economy on
track, maintaining low interest rates, for example. In accordance
with its IMF loan agreement, the administration also is taking steps
to improve the public sector's fiscal health. However, many
challenges to improved prosperity remain. Unemployment was stuck at
a record 20% in 2000, contributing to the extreme inequality in
income distribution. Two of Colombia's leading exports, oil and
coffee, face an uncertain future; new exploration is needed to
offset declining oil production, while coffee harvests and prices
are depressed. The lack of public security is a key concern for
investors, making progress in the government's peace negotiations
with insurgent groups an important driver of economic performance.
Colombia is looking for continued support from the international
community to boost economic and peace prospects.

Comoros    Economy

Economy - overview: One of the world's poorest countries, Comoros is
made up of three islands that have inadequate transportation links,
a young and rapidly increasing population, and few natural
resources. The low educational level of the labor force contributes
to a subsistence level of economic activity, high unemployment, and
a heavy dependence on foreign grants and technical assistance.
Agriculture, including fishing, hunting, and forestry, is the
leading sector of the economy. It contributes 40% to GDP, employs
80% of the labor force, and provides most of the exports. The
country is not self-sufficient in food production; rice, the main
staple, accounts for the bulk of imports. The government is
struggling to upgrade education and technical training, to privatize
commercial and industrial enterprises, to improve health services,
to diversify exports, to promote tourism, and to reduce the high
population growth rate. Continued foreign support is essential if
the goal of 4% annual GDP growth is to be met. Remittances from
150,000 Comorans abroad help supplement GDP.

Congo, Democratic Republic of the    Introduction

Background: Since 1994 the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DROC;
formerly called Zaire) has been rent by ethnic strife and civil war,
touched off by a massive inflow of refugees from the fighting in
Rwanda and Burundi. The government of former president MOBUTU Sese
Seko was toppled by a rebellion led by Laurent KABILA in May 1997;
his regime was subsequently challenged by a Rwanda- and
Uganda-backed rebellion in August 1998. Troops from Zimbabwe,
Angola, Namibia, Chad, and Sudan intervened to support the Kinshasa
regime. A cease-fire was signed on 10 July 1999, but sporadic
fighting continued. KABILA was assassinated in January 2001 and his
son Joseph KABILA was named head of state. The new president quickly
began overtures to end the war.

between rebels and government forces in October 1996 caused 875,000
refugees to return to Rwanda in late 1996 and early 1997; an
additional 173,000 Rwandan refugees disappeared in early 1997 and
are assumed to have been killed by Zairian forces; fighting between
the Congolese government and Uganda- and Rwanda-backed Congolese
rebels spawned a regional war in DROC in August 1998, which left 1.8
million Congolese displaced in DROC and caused 300,000 Congolese
refugees to flee to surrounding countries

Congo, Democratic Republic of the    Economy

Economy - overview: The economy of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo - a nation endowed with vast potential wealth - has declined
drastically since the mid-1980s. The new government instituted a
tight fiscal policy that initially curbed inflation and currency
depreciation, but these small gains were quickly reversed when the
foreign-backed rebellion in the eastern part of the country began in
August 1998. The war has dramatically reduced national output and
government revenue and has increased external debt. Foreign
businesses have curtailed operations due to uncertainty about the
outcome of the conflict and because of increased government
harassment and restrictions. The war has intensified the impact of
such basic problems as an uncertain legal framework, corruption,
raging inflation, and lack of openness in government economic policy
and financial operations. A number of IMF and World Bank missions
have met with the government to help it develop a coherent economic
plan but associated reforms are on hold.

Congo, Republic of the    Economy

Economy - overview: The economy is a mixture of village agriculture
and handicrafts, an industrial sector based largely on oil, support
services, and a government characterized by budget problems and
overstaffing. Oil has supplanted forestry as the mainstay of the
economy, providing a major share of government revenues and exports.
In the early 1980s, rapidly rising oil revenues enabled the
government to finance large-scale development projects with GDP
growth averaging 5% annually, one of the highest rates in Africa.
Moreover, the government has mortgaged a substantial portion of its
oil earnings, contributing to the government's shortage of revenues.
The 12 January 1994 devaluation of Franc Zone currencies by 50%
resulted in inflation of 61% in 1994, but inflation has subsided
since. Economic reform efforts continued with the support of
international organizations, notably the World Bank and the IMF. The
reform program came to a halt in June 1997 when civil war erupted.
Denis SASSOU-NGUESSO, who returned to power when the war ended in
October 1997, publicly expressed interest in moving forward on
economic reforms and privatization and in renewing cooperation with
international financial institutions. However, economic progress was
badly hurt by slumping oil prices and the resumption of armed
conflict in December 1998, which worsened the Republic of the
Congo's budget deficit. Even with the IMF's renewed confidence and
high world oil prices, Congo is unlikely to realize growth of more
than 5% in 2001-02. With the return to fragile peace, the IMF
approved a $14 million credit in November 2000 to aid post-conflict
reconstruction.

@Cook Islands





Cook Islands    Introduction

Background: Named after Captain Cook, who sighted them in 1770, the
islands became a British protectorate in 1888. By 1900,
administrative control was transferred to New Zealand; in 1965
residents chose self-government in free association with New
Zealand. The emigration of skilled workers to New Zealand and
government deficits are continuing problems.

Cook Islands    Economy

Economy - overview: Like many other South Pacific island nations,
the Cook Islands' economic development is hindered by the isolation
of the country from foreign markets, the limited size of domestic
markets, lack of natural resources, periodic devastation from
natural disasters, and inadequate infrastructure. Agriculture
provides the economic base with major exports made up of copra and
citrus fruit. Manufacturing activities are limited to fruit
processing, clothing, and handicrafts. Trade deficits are made up
for by remittances from emigrants and by foreign aid, overwhelmingly
from New Zealand. In the 1980s and 1990s, the country lived beyond
its means, maintaining a bloated public service and accumulating a
large foreign debt. Subsequent reforms, including the sale of state
assets, the strengthening of economic management, the encouragement
of tourism, and a debt restructuring agreement, have rekindled
investment and growth.

Costa Rica    Economy

Economy - overview: Costa Rica's basically stable economy depends on
tourism, agriculture, and electronics exports. Poverty has been
substantially reduced over the past 15 years, and a strong social
safety net has been put into place. Foreign investors remain
attracted by the country's political stability and high education
levels, and tourism continues to bring in foreign exchange. However,
traditional export sectors have not kept pace. Low coffee prices and
an overabundance of bananas have hurt the agricultural sector. The
government continues to grapple with its large deficit and massive
internal debt and with the need to modernize the state-owned
electricity and telecommunications sector.

@Cote d'Ivoire




Cote d'Ivoire    Introduction

Background: Close ties to France since independence in 1960, the
development of cocoa production for export, and foreign investment
made Cote d'Ivoire one of the most prosperous of the tropical
African states. Falling cocoa prices and political turmoil, however,
sparked an economic downturn in 1999 and 2000. On 25 December 1999,
a military coup - the first ever in Cote d'Ivoire's history -
overthrew the government led by President Henri Konan BEDIE.
Presidential and legislative elections held in October and December
2000 provoked violence due to the exclusion of opposition leader
Alassane OUATTARA. In October 2000, Laurent GBAGBO replaced junta
leader Robert GUEI as president, ending 10 months of military rule.

Cote d'Ivoire    Economy

Economy - overview: Cote d'Ivoire is among the world's largest
producers and exporters of coffee, cocoa beans, and palm oil.
Consequently, the economy is highly sensitive to fluctuations in
international prices for these products and to weather conditions.
Despite government attempts to diversify the economy, it is still
largely dependent on agriculture and related activities, which
engage roughly 68% of the population. After several years of lagging
performance, the Ivorian economy began a comeback in 1994, due to
the 50% devaluation of the CFA franc and improved prices for cocoa
and coffee, growth in nontraditional primary exports such as
pineapples and rubber, limited trade and banking liberalization,
offshore oil and gas discoveries, and generous external financing
and debt rescheduling by multilateral lenders and France. Moreover,
government adherence to donor-mandated reforms led to a jump in
growth to 5% annually in 1996-99. Growth was negative in 2000
because of the difficulty of meeting the conditions of international
donors, continued low prices of key exports, and post-coup
instability. In 2001-02, a moderate rebound in the cocoa market
could boost growth back above 3%; however, political instability
could impede growth again.

from Yugoslavia in 1991, it took four years of sporadic, but often
bitter, fighting before occupying Serb armies were mostly cleared
from Croatian lands. Under UN supervision the last Serb-held enclave
in eastern Slavonia was returned to Croatia in 1998.

Croatia    Economy

Economy - overview: Before the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the
Republic of Croatia, after Slovenia, was the most prosperous and
industrialized area, with a per capita output perhaps one-third
above the Yugoslav average. Croatia faces considerable economic
problems stemming from: the legacy of longtime communist
mismanagement of the economy; damage during the internecine fighting
to bridges, factories, power lines, buildings, and houses; the large
refugee and displaced population, both Croatian and Bosnian; and the
disruption of economic ties. Stepped-up Western aid and investment,
especially in the tourist and oil industries, would help bolster the
economy. The economy emerged from its mild recession in 2000 with
tourism the main factor. Massive unemployment remains a key negative
element. The government's failure to press the economic reforms
needed to spur growth is largely the result of coalition politics
and public resistance, particularly from the trade unions, to
measures that would cut jobs, wages, or social benefits.

Cuba    Introduction

Background: Fidel CASTRO led a rebel army to victory in 1959; his
iron rule has held the country together since. Cuba's communist
revolution, with Soviet support, was exported throughout Latin
America and Africa during the 1960s, 70s, and 80s. The country is
now slowly recovering from a severe economic recession in 1990,
following the withdrawal of former Soviet subsidies, worth $4
billion to $6 billion annually. Havana portrays its difficulties as
the result of the US embargo in place since 1961. Illicit migration
to the US - using homemade rafts, alien smugglers, or falsified
visas - is a continuing problem. Some 3,000 Cubans took to the
Straits of Florida in 2000; the US Coast Guard interdicted only
about 35% of these.

Cuba    Economy

Economy - overview: The government, the primary player in the
economy, has undertaken limited reforms in recent years to stem
excess liquidity, increase enterprise efficiency, and alleviate
serious shortages of food, consumer goods, and services, but
prioritizing of political control makes extensive reforms unlikely.
Living standards for the average Cuban, without access to dollars,
remain at a depressed level compared with 1990. The liberalized
farmers' markets introduced in 1994, sell above-quota production at
market prices, expand legal consumption alternatives, and reduce
black market prices. Income taxes and increased regulations
introduced since 1996 have sharply reduced the number of legally
self-employed from a high of 208,000 in January 1996. Havana
announced in 1995 that GDP declined by 35% during 1989-93 as a
result of lost Soviet aid and domestic inefficiencies. The slide in
GDP came to a halt in 1994 when Cuba reported growth in GDP of 0.7%.
Cuba reported that GDP increased by 2.5% in 1995 and 7.8% in 1996,
before slowing down in 1997 and 1998 to 2.5% and 1.2% respectively.
Growth recovered with a 6.2% increase in GDP in 1999 and a 5.6%
increase in 2000. Much of Cuba's recovery can be attributed to
tourism revenues and foreign investment. Growth in 2001 should
continue at the same level as the government balances the need for
economic loosening against its concern for firm political control.

Turkish Cypriot minority. In 1974, a Greek-sponsored attempt to
seize the government was met by military intervention from Turkey,
which soon controlled almost 40% of the island. In 1983, the
Turkish-held area declared itself the "Turkish Republic of Northern
Cyprus", but it is recognized only by Turkey. UN-led talks on the
status of Cyprus resumed in December 1999 to prepare the ground for
meaningful negotiations leading to a comprehensive settlement.

Cyprus    Economy

Economy - overview: Economic affairs are affected by the division of
the country. The Greek Cypriot economy is prosperous but highly
susceptible to external shocks. Erratic growth rates in the 1990s
reflect the economy's vulnerability to swings in tourist arrivals,
caused by political instability on the island and fluctuations in
economic conditions in Western Europe. Economic policy is focused on
meeting the criteria for admission to the EU. As in the Turkish
sector, water shortage is a growing problem, and several
desalination plants are planned. The Turkish Cypriot economy has
about one-fifth the population and one-third the per capita GDP of
the south. Because it is recognized only by Turkey, it has had much
difficulty arranging foreign financing, and foreign firms have
hesitated to invest there. It remains heavily dependent on
agriculture and government service, which together employ about half
of the work force. Moreover, the small, vulnerable economy has
suffered because the Turkish lira is legal tender. To compensate for
the economy's weakness, Turkey provides direct and indirect aid to
tourism, education, industry, etc.

Czech Republic    Introduction

Background: After World War II, Czechoslovakia fell within the
Soviet sphere of influence. In 1968, an invasion by Warsaw Pact
troops ended the efforts of the country's leaders to liberalize
party rule and create "socialism with a human face." Anti-Soviet
demonstrations the following year ushered in a period of harsh
repression. With the collapse of Soviet authority in 1989,
Czechoslovakia regained its freedom through a peaceful "Velvet
Revolution." On 1 January 1993, the country underwent a "velvet
divorce" into its two national components, the Czech Republic and
Slovakia. Now a member of NATO, the Czech Republic has moved toward
integration in world markets, a development that poses both
opportunities and risks.

Czech Republic    Economy

Economy - overview: Basically one of the most stable and prosperous
of the post-Communist states, the Czech Republic has been recovering
from recession since mid-1999. The economy grew about 2.5% in 2000
and should achieve somewhat higher growth in 2001. Growth is led by
exports to the EU, especially Germany, and foreign investment, while
domestic demand is reviving. Uncomfortably high fiscal and current
account deficits could be future problems. Unemployment is down to
8.7% as job creation continues in the rebounding economy; inflation
is up to 3.8% but still moderate. The EU put the Czech Republic just
behind Poland and Hungary in preparations for accession, which will
give further impetus and direction to structural reform. Moves to
complete banking, telecommunications and energy privatization will
add to foreign investment, while intensified restructuring among
large enterprises and banks and improvements in the financial sector
should strengthen output growth.

Denmark    Economy

Economy - overview: This thoroughly modern market economy features
high-tech agriculture, up-to-date small-scale and corporate
industry, extensive government welfare measures, comfortable living
standards, and high dependence on foreign trade. Denmark is a net
exporter of food and energy and has a comfortable balance of
payments surplus. The center-left coalition government has reduced
the formerly high unemployment rate and attained a budget surplus as
well as followed the previous government's policies of maintaining
low inflation and a stable currency. The coalition has lowered
marginal income tax rates and raised environmental taxes thus
maintaining overall tax revenues. Problems of bottlenecks, and
longer term demographic changes reducing the labor force, are being
addressed through labor market reforms. The government has been
successful in meeting, and even exceeding, the economic convergence
criteria for participating in the third phase (a common European
currency) of the European Monetary Union (EMU), but Denmark, in a
September 2000 referendum, reconfirmed its decision not to join the
11 other EU members in the euro. Even so, the Danish currency
remains pegged to the euro.

Djibouti    Economy

Economy - overview: The economy is based on service activities
connected with the country's strategic location and status as a free
trade zone in northeast Africa. Two-thirds of the inhabitants live
in the capital city, the remainder being mostly nomadic herders.
Scanty rainfall limits crop production to fruits and vegetables, and
most food must be imported. Djibouti provides services as both a
transit port for the region and an international transshipment and
refueling center. It has few natural resources and little industry.
The nation is, therefore, heavily dependent on foreign assistance to
help support its balance of payments and to finance development
projects. An unemployment rate of 40% to 50% continues to be a major
problem. Inflation is not a concern, however, because of the fixed
tie of the franc to the US dollar. Per capita consumption dropped an
estimated 35% over the last seven years because of recession, civil
war, and a high population growth rate (including immigrants and
refugees). Faced with a multitude of economic difficulties, the
government has fallen in arrears on long-term external debt and has
been struggling to meet the stipulations of foreign aid donors. The
year 2001 will see only small growth as port activity should
decrease now that Ethiopia has more trade route options.

Dominica    Introduction

Background: Dominica was the last of the Caribbean islands to be
colonized by Europeans, due chiefly to the fierce resistance of the
native Caribs. France ceded possession to Great Britain in 1763,
which made the island a colony in 1805. In 1980, two years after
independence, Dominica's fortunes improved when a corrupt and
tyrannical administration was replaced by that of Mary Eugenia
CHARLES, the first female prime minister in the Caribbean, who
remained in office for 15 years.

Dominica    Economy

Economy - overview: The economy depends on agriculture and is highly
vulnerable to climatic conditions, notably tropical storms.
Agriculture, primarily bananas, accounts for 21% of GDP and employs
40% of the labor force. Development of the tourist industry remains
difficult because of the rugged coastline, lack of beaches, and the
lack of an international airport. Hurricane Luis devastated the
country's banana crop in September 1995; tropical storms had wiped
out one-quarter of the crop in 1994 as well. The subsequent recovery
has been fueled by increases in construction, soap production, and
tourist arrivals. The government is attempting to develop an
offshore financial industry in order to diversify the island's
production base.

Dominican Republic    Economy

Economy - overview: The Dominican economy experienced dramatic
growth over the last decade, even though the economy was hit hard by
Hurricane Georges in 1998. Although the country has long been viewed
primarily as an exporter of sugar, coffee, and tobacco, in recent
years the service sector has overtaken agriculture as the economy's
largest employer, due to growth in tourism and free trade zones. The
country suffers from marked income inequality; the poorest half of
the population receives less than one-fifth of GNP, while the
richest ten percent enjoy 40% of national income. In December 2000,
the new MEJIA administration passed broad new tax legislation which
it hopes will provide enough revenue to offset rising oil prices and
to service foreign debt.

Ecuador    Economy

Economy - overview: Ecuador has substantial oil resources and rich
agricultural areas. Because the country exports primary products
such as oil, bananas, and shrimp, fluctuations in world market
prices can have a substantial domestic impact. Ecuador joined the
World Trade Organization in 1996, but has failed to comply with many
of its accession commitments. In recent years, growth has been
uneven due to ill-conceived fiscal stabilization measures. The
aftermath of El Nino and depressed oil market of 1997-98 drove
Ecuador's economy into a free-fall in 1999. The beginning of 1999
saw the banking sector collapse, which helped precipitate an
unprecedented default on external loans later that year. Continued
economic instability drove a 70% depreciation of the currency
throughout 1999, which eventually forced a desperate government to
"dollarize" the currency regime in 2000. The move stabilized the
currency, but did not stave off the ouster of the government. The
new president, Gustavo NOBOA has yet to complete negotiations for a
long sought IMF accord. He will find it difficult to push through
the reforms necessary to make "dollarization" work in the long run.

Egypt    Introduction

Background: Nominally independent from the UK in 1922, Egypt
acquired full sovereignty following World War II. The completion of
the Aswan High Dam in 1971 and the resultant Lake Nasser have
altered the time-honored place of the Nile river in the agriculture
and ecology of Egypt. A rapidly growing population (the largest in
the Arab world), limited arable land, and dependence on the Nile all
continue to overtax resources and stress society. The government has
struggled to ready the economy for the new millennium through
economic reform and massive investment in communications and
physical infrastructure.

Egypt    Economy

Economy - overview: A series of IMF arrangements - along with
massive external debt relief resulting from Egypt's participation in
the Gulf war coalition - helped Egypt improve its macroeconomic
performance during the 1990s. Sound fiscal and monetary policies
through the mid-1990s helped to tame inflation, slash budget
deficits, and build up foreign reserves, while structural reforms
such as privatization and new business legislation prompted
increased foreign investment. By mid-1998, however, the pace of
structural reform slackened, and lower combined hard currency
earnings resulted in pressure on the Egyptian pound and sporadic US
dollar shortages. External payments were not in crisis, but Cairo's
attempts to curb demand for foreign exchange convinced some
investors and currency traders that government financial operations
lacked transparency and coordination. Monetary pressures have since
eased, however, with the 1999-2000 higher oil prices, a rebound in
tourism, and a series of mini-devaluations of the pound. The
development of a gas export market is a major plus factor in future
growth.

El Salvador    Economy

Economy - overview: El Salvador is a struggling Central American
economy which has been suffering from a weak tax collection system,
factory closings, the aftermaths of Hurricane Mitch of 1998 and the
devastating earthquakes of early 2001, and weak world coffee prices.
On the bright side, in recent years inflation has fallen to single
digit levels, and total exports have grown substantially. The trade
deficit has been offset by remittances (an estimated $1.6 billion in
2000) from Salvadorans living abroad and by external aid. As of 1
January 2001, the US dollar was made legal tender alongside the
colon.

Equatorial Guinea    Economy

Economy - overview: The discovery and exploitation of large oil
reserves have contributed to dramatic economic growth in recent
years. Forestry, farming, and fishing are also major components of
GDP. Subsistence farming predominates. Although pre-independence
Equatorial Guinea counted on cocoa production for hard currency
earnings, the deterioration of the rural economy under successive
brutal regimes has diminished potential for agriculture-led growth.
A number of aid programs sponsored by the World Bank and the IMF
have been cut off since 1993 because of the government's gross
corruption and mismanagement. Businesses, for the most part, are
owned by government officials and their family members. Undeveloped
natural resources include titanium, iron ore, manganese, uranium,
and alluvial gold. The country responded favorably to the
devaluation of the CFA franc in January 1994. Boosts in production
and high world oil prices stimulated growth in 2000, with oil
accounting for 90% of greatly increased exports.

@Eritrea




Eritrea    Introduction

Background: Eritrea was awarded to Ethiopia in 1952 as part of a
federation. Ethiopia's annexation of Eritrea as a province 10 years
later sparked a 30-year struggle for independence that ended in 1991
with Eritrean rebels defeating governmental forces; independence was
overwhelmingly approved in a 1993 referendum. A two and a half year
border war with Ethiopia that erupted in 1998 ended under UN
auspices on 12 December 2000.

Eritrea    Economy

Economy - overview: With independence from Ethiopia on 24 May 1993,
Eritrea faced the economic problems of a small, desperately poor
country. The economy is largely based on subsistence agriculture,
with 80% of the population involved in farming and herding. The
small industrial sector consists mainly of light industries with
outmoded technologies. Domestic output (GDP) is substantially
augmented by worker remittances from abroad. Government revenues
come from custom duties and taxes on income and sales. Road
construction is a top domestic priority. In the long term, Eritrea
may benefit from the development of offshore oil, offshore fishing,
and tourism. Eritrea's economic future depends on its ability to
master fundamental social and economic problems, e.g., by reducing
illiteracy, promoting job creation, expanding technical training,
attracting foreign investment, and streamlining the bureaucracy.
Eritrea's agriculture over the last two years was severely weakened
by war and drought, and many farmlands must wait to be demined.
Another major difficulty is the ports, which prior to the war were
Ethiopia's preferred outlets but since have seen trade dry up.

Estonia    Economy

Economy - overview: In 2000, Estonia rebounded from the Russian
financial crisis by scaling back its budget and reorienting trade
away from Russian markets into EU member states. After GDP shrank
1.1% in 1999, the economy made a strong recovery in 2000, with
growth estimated at 6.4% - the highest in Central and Eastern
Europe. Estonia joined the World Trade Organization in November 1999
- the second Baltic state to join - and continues its EU accession
talks. For 2001, Estonians predict GDP to grow around 6%, inflation
of between 4.2%-5.3%, and a balanced budget. Substantial gains were
made in completing privatization of Estonia's few remaining large,
state-owned companies in 2000, and this momentum is expected to
continue in 2001. Estonia hopes to join the EU during the next round
of enlargement tentatively set for 2004.

Ethiopia    Introduction

Background: Unique among African countries, the ancient Ethiopian
monarchy maintained its freedom from colonial rule, one exception
being the Italian occupation of 1936-41. In 1974 a military junta,
the Derg, deposed Emperor Haile SELASSIE (who had ruled since 1930)
and established a socialist state. Torn by bloody coups, uprisings,
wide-scale drought, and massive refugee problems, the regime was
finally toppled by a coalition of rebel forces, the Ethiopian
People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), in 1991. A
constitution was adopted in 1994 and Ethiopia's first multiparty
elections were held in 1995. A two and a half year border war with
Eritrea that ended with a peace treaty on 12 December 2000 has
strengthened the ruling coalition, but has hurt the nation's economy.

Ethiopia    Economy

Economy - overview: Ethiopia's economy is based on agriculture,
which accounts for half of GDP, 90% of exports, and 80% of total
employment. The agricultural sector suffers from frequent periods of
drought and poor cultivation practices, and as many as 4.6 million
people need food assistance annually. Coffee is critical to the
Ethiopian economy, and Ethiopia earned $267 million in 1999 by
exporting 105,000 metric tons. According to current estimates,
coffee contributes 10% of Ethiopia's GDP. More than 15 million
people (25% of the population) derive their livelihood from the
coffee sector. Other exports include live animals, hides, gold, and
qat. In December 1999, Ethiopia signed a $1.4 billion joint venture
deal to develop a huge natural gas field in the Somali Regional
State. The war with Eritrea forced the government to spend scarce
resources on the military and to scale back ambitious development
plans. Foreign investment has declined significantly. Government
taxes imposed in late 1999 to raise money for the war depressed an
already weak economy. The war forced the government to improve roads
and other parts of the previously neglected infrastructure, but only
certain regions of the nation benefited. Recovery from the war is
mostly contingent on natural factors. A drought has continued into
the end of 2000 and food relief is expected to be needed through
mid-2001 at least. Ethiopia may receive Highly Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC) debt relief by the end of the year.

the 12 December 2000 peace agreement ending a two year war with
Eritrea, the UN will administer a 25-km wide temporary security zone
within Eritrea until a joint boundary commission delimits and
demarcates a final boundary; dispute over alignment of boundary with

@Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas)





Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas)    Introduction

Background: Although first sighted by an English navigator in 1592,
the first landing (English) did not occur until almost a century
later in 1690, and the first settlement (French) was not established
until 1764. The colony was turned over to Spain two years later and
the islands have since been the subject of a territorial dispute,
first between Britain and Spain, then between Britain and Argentina.
The UK asserted its claim to the islands by establishing a naval
garrison there in 1833. Argentina invaded the islands on 2 April
1982. The British responded with an expeditionary force that landed
seven weeks later and after fierce fighting forced Argentine
surrender on 14 June 1982.

Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas)    Economy

Economy - overview: The economy was formerly based on agriculture,
mainly sheep farming, but today fishing contributes the bulk of
economic activity. In 1987 the government began selling fishing
licenses to foreign trawlers operating within the Falklands
exclusive fishing zone. These license fees total more than $40
million per year, which goes to support the island's health,
education, and welfare system. Squid accounts for 75% of the fish
taken. Dairy farming supports domestic consumption; crops furnish
winter fodder. Exports feature shipments of high-grade wool to the
UK and the sale of postage stamps and coins. To encourage tourism,
the Falkland Islands Development Corporation has built three lodges
for visitors attracted by the abundant wildlife and trout fishing.
The islands are now self-financing except for defense. The British
Geological Survey announced a 200-mile oil exploration zone around
the islands in 1993, and early seismic surveys suggest substantial
reserves capable of producing 500,000 barrels per day; to date no
exploitable site has been identified. An agreement between Argentina
and the UK in 1995 seeks to defuse licensing and sovereignty
conflicts that would dampen foreign interest in exploiting potential
oil reserves.

Faroe Islands    Economy

Economy - overview: The Faroese economy has had a strong performance
since 1994, mostly as a result of increasing fish landings and high
and stable export prices. Unemployment is falling and there are
signs of labor shortages in several sectors. The positive economic
development has helped the Faroese Home Rule Government produce
increasing budget surpluses which in turn help to reduce the large
public debt, most of it owed to Denmark. However, the total
dependence on fishing makes the Faroese economy extremely
vulnerable, and the present fishing efforts appear in excess of what
is required to ensure a sustainable level of fishing in the long
term. Oil finds close to the Faroese area give hope for deposits in
the immediate Faroese area, which may eventually lay the basis for a
more diversified economy and thus less dependence on Denmark and
Danish economic assistance. Aided by a substantial annual subsidy
(15% of GDP) from Denmark, the Faroese have a standard of living not
far below the Danes and other Scandinavians.

@Fiji




Fiji    Introduction

Background: Fiji became independent in 1970, after nearly a century
as a British colony. Democratic rule was interrupted by two military
coups in 1987, caused by concern over a government perceived as
dominated by the Indian community (descendants of contract laborers
brought to the islands by the British in the 19th century). A 1990
constitution favored native Melanesian control of Fiji, but led to
heavy Indian emigration; the population loss resulted in economic
difficulties, but ensured that Melanesians became the majority.
Amendments enacted in 1997 made the constitution more equitable.
Free and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted in a government led by
an Indo-Fijian, but a coup in May of 2000 ushered in a prolonged
period of political turmoil. New elections are scheduled for August
2001.

Fiji    Economy

Economy - overview: Fiji, endowed with forest, mineral, and fish
resources, is one of the most developed of the Pacific island
economies, though still with a large subsistence sector. Sugar
exports and a growing tourist industry are the major sources of
foreign exchange. Sugar processing makes up one-third of industrial
activity. Roughly 300,000 tourists visit each year, including
thousands of Americans following the start of regularly scheduled
non-stop air service from Los Angeles. Fiji's growth slowed in 1997
because the sugar industry suffered from low world prices and rent
disputes between farmers and landowners. Drought in 1998 further
damaged the sugar industry, but its recovery in 1999 contributed to
robust GDP growth. Long-term problems include low investment and
uncertain property rights. The political turmoil in Fiji has had a
severe impact with the economy shrinking by 8% in 1999 and over
7,000 people losing their jobs. The interim government's 2001 budget
is an attempt to attract foreign investment and restart economic
activity. The government's ability to manage the budget and fulfill
predictions of 4% growth for 2001 will depend on a return to
stability, a regaining of investor confidence, and the absence of
international sanctions (which could cripple Fiji's sugar and
textile industry).

Finland    Introduction

Background: Ruled by Sweden from the 12th to the 19th centuries and
by Russia from 1809, Finland finally won its independence in 1917.
During World War II, it was able to successfully defend its freedom
and fend off invasions by the Soviet Union and Germany. In the
subsequent half century, the Finns have made a remarkable
transformation from a farm/forest economy to a diversified modern
industrial economy; per capita income is now on par with Western
Europe. As a member of the European Union, Finland was the only
Nordic state to join the euro system at its initiation in January
1999.

Finland    Economy

Economy - overview: Finland has a highly industrialized, largely
free-market economy, with per capita output roughly that of the UK,
France, Germany, and Italy. Its key economic sector is manufacturing
- principally the wood, metals, engineering, telecommunications, and
electronics industries. Trade is important, with exports equaling
more than one-third of GDP. Except for timber and several minerals,
Finland depends on imports of raw materials, energy, and some
components for manufactured goods. Because of the climate,
agricultural development is limited to maintaining self-sufficiency
in basic products. Forestry, an important export earner, provides a
secondary occupation for the rural population. Rapidly increasing
integration with Western Europe - Finland was one of the 11
countries joining the euro monetary system (EMU) on 1 January 1999 -
will dominate the economic picture over the next several years.
Growth in 2001 will be bolstered by strong private consumption, yet
may be 1 or 2 points lower than in 2000, largely because of a
weakening in export demand.

France    Introduction

Background: Although ultimately a victor in World Wars I and II,
France suffered extensive losses in its empire, wealth, manpower,
and rank as a dominant nation-state. Nevertheless, France today is
one of the most modern countries in the world and is a leader among
European nations. Since 1958, it has constructed a presidential
democracy resistant to the instabilities experienced in earlier
parliamentary democracies. In recent years, its reconciliation and
cooperation with Germany have proved central to the economic
integration of Europe, including the advent of the euro in January
1999. Presently, France is at the forefront of European states
seeking to exploit the momentum of monetary union to advance the
creation of a more unified and capable European defense and security
apparatus.

France    Economy

Economy - overview: France is in the midst of transition, from an
economy that featured extensive government ownership and
intervention to one that relies more on market mechanisms. The
government remains dominant in some sectors, particularly power,
public transport, and defense industries, but it has been relaxing
its control since the mid-1980s. The Socialist-led government has
sold off part of its holdings in France Telecom, Air France, Thales,
Thomson Multimedia, and the European Aerospace and Defense Company
(EADS). The telecommunications sector is gradually being opened to
competition. France's leaders remain committed to a capitalism in
which they maintain social equity by means of laws, tax policies,
and social spending that reduce income disparity and the impact of
free markets on public health and welfare. The government has done
little to cut generous unemployment and retirement benefits which
impose a heavy tax burden and discourage hiring. It has also shied
from measures that would dramatically increase the use of stock
options and retirement investment plans; such measures would boost
the stock market and fast-growing IT firms as well as ease the
burden on the pension system, but would disproportionately benefit
the rich. In addition to the tax burden, the reduction of the work
week to 35-hours has drawn criticism for lowering the
competitiveness of French companies.

French Guiana    Economy

Economy - overview: The economy is tied closely to that of France
through subsidies and imports. Besides the French space center at
Kourou, fishing and forestry are the most important economic
activities. The large reserves of tropical hardwoods, not fully
exploited, support an expanding sawmill industry which provides sawn
logs for export. Cultivation of crops is limited to the coastal
area, where the population is largely concentrated; rice and manioc
are the major crops. French Guiana is heavily dependent on imports
of food and energy. Unemployment is a serious problem, particularly
among younger workers.

industry. Tourism accounts for about one-fourth of GDP and is a
primary source of hard currency earnings. The small manufacturing
sector primarily processes agricultural products. The territory
benefited from a five-year (1994-98) development agreement with
France aimed principally at creating new jobs.

Gabon    Economy

Economy - overview: Gabon enjoys a per capita income four times that
of most nations of sub-Saharan Africa. This has supported a sharp
decline in extreme poverty; yet because of high income inequality a
large proportion of the population remains poor. Gabon depended on
timber and manganese until oil was discovered offshore in the early
1970s. The oil sector now accounts for 50% of GDP. Gabon continues
to face fluctuating prices for its oil, timber, manganese, and
uranium exports. Despite the abundance of natural wealth, the
economy is hobbled by poor fiscal management. In 1992, the fiscal
deficit widened to 2.4% of GDP, and Gabon failed to settle arrears
on its bilateral debt, leading to a cancellation of rescheduling
agreements with official and private creditors. Devaluation of its
Francophone currency by 50% on 12 January 1994 sparked a one-time
inflationary surge, to 35%; the rate dropped to 6% in 1996. The IMF
provided a one-year standby arrangement in 1994-95, a three-year
Enhanced Financing Facility (EFF) at near commercial rates beginning
in late 1995, and stand-by credit of $119 million in October 2000.
Those agreements mandate progress in privatization and fiscal
discipline. France provided additional financial support in January
1997 after Gabon had met IMF targets for mid-1996. In 1997, an IMF
mission to Gabon criticized the government for overspending on
off-budget items, overborrowing from the central bank, and slipping
on its schedule for privatization and administrative reform. The
rebound of oil prices in 1999-2000 helped growth, but drops in
production hampered Gabon from fully realizing potential gains. An
expected decline in oil output may lead to contraction in GDP in
2001-02.

Gambia, The    Introduction

Background: The Gambia gained its independence from the UK in 1965;
it formed a short-lived federation of Senegambia with Senegal
between 1982 and 1989. In 1991 the two nations signed a friendship
and cooperation treaty. A military coup in 1994 overthrew the
president and banned political activity, but a new 1996 constitution
and presidential elections, followed by parliamentary balloting in
1997, have completed a nominal return to civilian rule.

Gambia, The    Economy

Economy - overview: The Gambia has no important mineral or other
natural resources and has a limited agricultural base. About 75% of
the population depends on crops and livestock for its livelihood.
Small-scale manufacturing activity features the processing of
peanuts, fish, and hides. Reexport trade normally constitutes a
major segment of economic activity, but a 1999 government-imposed
preshipment inspection plan, instability of the Gambian dalasi, and
the stable political situation in Senegal have drawn some of the
reexport trade away from Banjul. The government's 1998 seizure of
the private peanut firm Alimenta eliminated the largest purchaser of
Gambian groundnuts; the following two marketing seasons have seen
significantly lower prices and sales. A decline in tourism from 1999
to 2000 has also held back growth. Unemployment and underemployment
rates are extremely high. Shortrun economic progress remains highly
dependent on sustained bilateral and multilateral aid, on
responsible government economic management as forwarded by IMF
technical help and advice, and on expected growth in the
construction sector.

@Gaza Strip




Gaza Strip    Introduction

Background: The Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles on Interim
Self-Government Arrangements (the DOP), signed in Washington on 13
September 1993, provided for a transitional period not exceeding
five years of Palestinian interim self-government in the Gaza Strip
and the West Bank. Under the DOP, Israel agreed to transfer certain
powers and responsibilities to the Palestinian Authority, which
includes the Palestinian Legislative Council elected in January
1996, as part of the interim self-governing arrangements in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. A transfer of powers and responsibilities for
the Gaza Strip and Jericho took place pursuant to the Israel-PLO 4
May 1994 Cairo Agreement on the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area and
in additional areas of the West Bank pursuant to the Israel-PLO 28
September 1995 Interim Agreement, the Israel-PLO 15 January 1997
Protocol Concerning Redeployment in Hebron, the Israel-PLO 23
October 1998 Wye River Memorandum, and the 4 September 1999 Sharm
el-Sheikh Agreement. The DOP provides that Israel will retain
responsibility during the transitional period for external security
and for internal security and public order of settlements and
Israeli citizens. Permanent status is to be determined through
direct negotiations, which resumed in September 1999 after a
three-year hiatus. An intifadah broke out in September 2000; the
resulting widespread violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
Israel's military response, and instability in the Palestinian
Authority are undermining progress toward a permanent settlement.

Gaza Strip    Economy

Economy - overview: Economic output in the Gaza Strip - which comes
under the responsibility of the Palestinian Authority since the
Cairo Agreement of May 1994 - declined perhaps one-third between
1992 and 1996. The downturn was largely the result of Israeli
closure policies - the imposition of generalized border closures in
response to security incidents in Israel - which disrupted
previously established labor and commodity market relationships
between Israel and the WBGS (West Bank and Gaza Strip). The most
serious negative social effect of this downturn was the emergence of
high unemployment; unemployment in the WBGS during the 1980s was
generally under 5%; by 1995 it had risen to over 20%. Since 1997
Israel's use of comprehensive closures has decreased and, in 1998,
Israel implemented new policies to reduce the impact of closures and
other security procedures on the movement of Palestinian goods and
labor. These changes fueled an almost three-year long economic
recovery in the West Bank and Gaza Strip; real GDP grew by 5% in
1998 and 6% in 1999. Recovery was upended in the last quarter of
2000 with the outbreak of Palestinian violence, which triggered
tight Israeli closures of Palestinian self-rule areas and a severe
disruption of trade and labor movements.

Georgia    Introduction

Background: Georgia was absorbed into the Russian Empire in the 19th
century. Independent for three years (1918-1921) following the
Russian revolution, it was forcibly incorporated into the USSR until
the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991. Russian troops remain garrisoned
at four military bases and as peacekeepers in the separatist regions
of Abkhazia and South Ossetia (but are scheduled to withdraw from
two of the bases by July 2001). Despite a badly degraded
transportation network - brought on by ethnic conflict, criminal
activities, and fuel shortages - the country continues to move
toward a market economy and greater integration with Western
institutions.

Georgia    Economy

Economy - overview: Georgia's economy has traditionally revolved
around Black Sea tourism; cultivation of citrus fruits, tea, and
grapes; mining of manganese and copper; and output of a small
industrial sector producing wine, metals, machinery, chemicals, and
textiles. The country imports the bulk of its energy needs,
including natural gas and oil products. Its only sizable internal
energy resource is hydropower. Despite the severe damage the economy
has suffered due to civil strife, Georgia, with the help of the IMF
and World Bank, has made substantial economic gains since 1995,
increasing GDP growth and slashing inflation. The Georgian economy
continues to experience large budget deficits due to a failure to
collect tax revenues. Georgia also still suffers from energy
shortages; it privatized the distribution network in 1998, and
deliveries are steadily improving. The country is pinning its hopes
for long-term recovery on the development of an international
transportation corridor through the key Black Sea ports of P'ot'i
and Bat'umi. The growing trade deficit, continuing problems with tax
evasion and corruption, and political uncertainties cloud the
short-term economic picture.

Germany    Introduction

Background: As Western Europe's richest and most populous nation,
Germany remains a key member of the continent's economic, political,
and defense organizations. European power struggles immersed the
country in two devastating World Wars in the first half of the 20th
century and left the country occupied by the victorious Allied
powers of the US, UK, France, and the Soviet Union in 1945. With the
advent of the Cold War, two German states were formed in 1949: the
western Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and the eastern German
Democratic Republic (GDR). The democratic FRG embedded itself in key
Western economic and security organizations, the EC and NATO, while
the communist GDR was on the front line of the Soviet-led Warsaw
Pact. The decline of the USSR and the end of the Cold War allowed
for German unification in 1990. Since then Germany has expended
considerable funds to bring eastern productivity and wages up to
western standards. In January 1999, Germany and 10 other EU
countries formed a common European currency, the euro.

Germany    Economy

Economy - overview: Germany possesses the world's third most
technologically powerful economy after the US and Japan, but
structural market rigidities - including the substantial non-wage
costs of hiring new workers - have made unemployment a long-term,
not just a cyclical, problem. Germany's aging population, combined
with high unemployment, has pushed social security outlays to a
level exceeding contributions from workers. The modernization and
integration of the eastern German economy remains a costly long-term
problem, with annual transfers from western Germany amounting to
roughly $70 billion. Growth picked up to 3% in 2000, largely due to
recovering global demand; newly passed business and income tax cuts
are expected to keep growth strong in 2001. Corporate restructuring
and growing capital markets are transforming the German economy to
meet the challenges of European economic integration and
globalization in general.

Ghana    Introduction

Background: Formed from the merger of the British colony of the Gold
Coast and the Togoland trust territory, Ghana in 1957 became the
first country in colonial Africa to gain its independence. A long
series of coups resulted in the suspension of the constitution in
1981 and the banning of political parties. A new constitution,
restoring multiparty politics, was approved in 1992. Lt. Jerry
RAWLINGS, head of state since 1981, won presidential elections in
1992 and 1996, but was constitutionally prevented from running for a
third term in 2000. He was succeeded by John KUFUOR.

Ghana    Economy

Economy - overview: Well endowed with natural resources, Ghana has
twice the per capita output of the poorer countries in West Africa.
Even so, Ghana remains heavily dependent on international financial
and technical assistance. Gold, timber, and cocoa production are
major sources of foreign exchange. The domestic economy continues to
revolve around subsistence agriculture, which accounts for 36% of
GDP and employs 60% of the work force, mainly small landholders. In
1995-97, Ghana made mixed progress under a three-year structural
adjustment program in cooperation with the IMF. On the minus side,
public sector wage increases and regional peacekeeping commitments
have led to continued inflationary deficit financing, depreciation
of the cedi, and rising public discontent with Ghana's austerity
measures. Political uncertainty and a depressed cocoa market led to
disappointing growth in 2000. A rebound in the cocoa market should
push growth over 4% in 2001-02.

Gibraltar    Economy

Economy - overview: Gibraltar benefits from an extensive shipping
trade, offshore banking, and its position as an international
conference center. The British military presence has been sharply
reduced and now contributes about 11% to the local economy. The
financial sector accounts for 20% of GDP; tourism (almost 6 million
visitors in 1998), shipping services fees, and duties on consumer
goods also generate revenue. In recent years, Gibraltar has seen
major structural change from a public to a private sector economy,
but changes in government spending still have a major impact on the
level of employment.

Greece    Introduction

Background: Greece achieved its independence from the Ottoman Empire
in 1829. During the second half of the 19th century and the first
half of the 20th century, it gradually added neighboring islands and
territories with Greek-speaking populations. Following the defeat of
communist rebels in 1949, Greece joined NATO in 1952. A military
dictatorship, which in 1967 suspended many political liberties and
forced the king to flee the country, lasted seven years. Democratic
elections in 1974 and a referendum created a parliamentary republic
and abolished the monarchy; Greece joined the European Community or
EC in 1981 (which became the EU in 1992).

Greece    Economy

Economy - overview: Greece has a mixed capitalist economy with the
public sector accounting for about half of GDP. Tourism is a key
industry, providing a large portion of GDP and foreign exchange
earnings. Greece is a major beneficiary of EU aid, equal to about 4%
of GDP. The economy has improved steadily over the last few years,
as the government has tightened policy in the run-up to Greece's
entry into the EU's Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) on 1 January
2001. In particular, Greece has cut its budget deficit to below 1%
of GDP and tightened monetary policy, with the result that inflation
fell from 20% in 1990 to 3.1% in 2000. Major challenges remaining
include the reduction of unemployment and further restructuring of
the economy, including the privatization of some leading state
enterprises. Growth, 3.8% in 2000, may fall off to 3%-3.5% in 2001.

Greenland    Economy

Economy - overview: The economy remains critically dependent on
exports of fish and substantial support from the Danish Government,
which supplies about half of government revenues. The public sector,
including publicly owned enterprises and the municipalities, plays
the dominant role in the economy. Despite several interesting
hydrocarbon and minerals exploration activities, it will take
several years before production can materialize. Tourism is the only
sector offering any near-term potential, and even this is limited
due to a short season and high costs.

Guadeloupe    Economy

Economy - overview: The economy depends on agriculture, tourism,
light industry, and services. It also depends on France for large
subsidies and imports. Tourism is a key industry, with most tourists
from the US; an increasingly large number of cruise ships visit the
islands. The traditional sugarcane crop is slowly being replaced by
other crops, such as bananas (which now supply about 50% of export
earnings), eggplant, and flowers. Other vegetables and root crops
are cultivated for local consumption, although Guadeloupe is still
dependent on imported food, mainly from France. Light industry
features sugar and rum production. Most manufactured goods and fuel
are imported. Unemployment is especially high among the young.
Hurricanes periodically devastate the economy.

Guam    Economy

Economy - overview: The economy depends on US military spending,
tourism, and the export of fish and handicrafts. Total US grants,
wage payments, and procurement outlays amounted to $1 billion in
1998. Over the past 20 years, the tourist industry has grown
rapidly, creating a construction boom for new hotels and the
expansion of older ones. More than 1 million tourists visit Guam
each year. The industry has recently suffered setbacks because of
the continuing Japanese slowdown; the Japanese normally make up
almost 90% of the tourists. Most food and industrial goods are
imported. Guam faces the problem of building up the civilian
economic sector to offset the impact of military downsizing.

Guatemala    Economy

Economy - overview: The agricultural sector accounts for about
one-fourth of GDP, two-thirds of exports, and half of the labor
force. Coffee, sugar, and bananas are the main products. Former
President ARZU (1996-2000) worked to implement a program of economic
liberalization and political modernization. The 1996 signing of the
peace accords, which ended 36 years of civil war, removed a major
obstacle to foreign investment. In 1998, Hurricane Mitch caused
relatively little damage to Guatemala compared to its neighbors.
Ongoing challenges include increasing government revenues,
negotiating further assistance from international donors, and
increasing the efficiency and openness of both government and
private financial operations. Despite low international prices for
Guatemala's main commodities, the economy grew by 3% in 2000 and is
forecast to grow by 4% in 2001. Guatemala, along with Honduras and
El Salvador, recently concluded a free trade agreement with Mexico
and has moved to protect international property rights. However, the
PORTILLO administration has undertaken a review of privatizations
under the previous administration, thereby creating some uncertainty
among investors.

states in 2000 agreed to a "line of adjacency" based on the de facto
boundary, which is not recognized by Guatemala

Illicit drugs: transit country for cocaine and heroin; minor
producer of illicit opium poppy and cannabis for the international
drug trade; proximity to Mexico makes Guatemala a major staging area
for drugs (cocaine and heroin shipments); money laundering is
probably increasing

Guinea    Economy

Economy - overview: Guinea possesses major mineral, hydropower, and
agricultural resources, yet remains a poor underdeveloped nation.
The country possesses over 30% of the world's bauxite reserves and
is the second largest bauxite producer. The mining sector accounted
for about 75% of exports in 1999. Long-run improvements in
government fiscal arrangements, literacy, and the legal framework
are needed if the country is to move out of poverty. The government
made encouraging progress in budget management in 1997-99, and
reform progress was praised in the World Bank/IMF October 2000
assessment. However, escalating fighting along the Sierra Leonean
and Liberian borders will cause major economic disruptions. In
addition to direct defense costs, the violence has led to a sharp
decline in investor confidence. Foreign mining companies have
reduced expatriate staff, while panic buying has created food
shortages and inflation in local markets. Real GDP growth is
expected to fall to 2% in 2001.

Guinea-Bissau    Introduction

Background: In 1994, 20 years after independence from Portugal, the
country's first multiparty legislative and presidential elections
were held. An army uprising that triggered a bloody civil war in
1998, created hundreds of thousands of displaced persons. The
president was ousted by a military junta in May 1999. An interim
government turned over power in February 2000 when opposition leader
Koumba YALLA took office following two rounds of transparent
presidential elections. Guinea-Bissau's transition back to democracy
will be complicated by a crippled economy devastated by civil war
and the military's predilection for governmental meddling.

Guinea-Bissau    Economy

Economy - overview: One of the 20 poorest countries in the world,
Guinea-Bissau depends mainly on farming and fishing. Cashew crops
have increased remarkably in recent years, and the country now ranks
sixth in cashew production. Guinea-Bissau exports fish and seafood
along with small amounts of peanuts, palm kernels, and timber. Rice
is the major crop and staple food. However, intermittent fighting
between Senegalese-backed government troops and a military junta
destroyed much of the country's infrastructure and caused widespread
damage to the economy in 1998; the civil war led to a 28% drop in
GDP that year, with partial recovery in 1999-2000. Before the war,
trade reform and price liberalization were the most successful part
of the country's structural adjustment program under IMF
sponsorship. The tightening of monetary policy and the development
of the private sector had also begun to reinvigorate the economy.
Because of high costs, the development of petroleum, phosphate, and
other mineral resources is not a near-term prospect. However,
unexploited offshore oil reserves could provide much-needed revenue
in the long run.

Guyana    Economy

Economy - overview: Severe drought and political turmoil contributed
to Guyana's negative growth of -1.8% for 1998 following six straight
years of growth of 5% or better. Growth came back to a positive 1.8%
in 1999 and 3% in 2000. Underlying growth factors have included
expansion in the key agricultural and mining sectors, a more
favorable atmosphere for business initiative, a more realistic
exchange rate, a moderate inflation rate, and continued support by
international organizations. President JAGDEO, the former finance
minister, is taking steps to reform the economy, including drafting
an investment code and restructuring the inefficient and
unresponsive public sector. Problems include a shortage of skilled
labor and a deficient infrastructure. The government must persist in
efforts to manage its sizable external debt and attract new
investment.

Haiti    Introduction

Background: One of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere,
Haiti has been plagued by political violence for most of its
history. Over three decades of dictatorship followed by military
rule ended in 1990 when Jean-Bertrand ARISTIDE was elected
president. Most of his term was usurped by a military takeover, but
he was able to return to office in 1994 and oversee the installation
of a close associate to the presidency in 1996. ARISTIDE won a
second term as president in 2000, and took office early the
following year.

Haiti    Economy

Economy - overview: About 80% of the population lives in abject
poverty. Nearly 70% of all Haitians depend on the agriculture
sector, which consists mainly of small-scale subsistence farming and
employs about two-thirds of the economically active work force. The
country has experienced little job creation since the former
President PREVAL took office in February 1996, although the informal
economy is growing. Following legislative elections in May 2000,
fraught with irregularities, international donors - including the US
and EU - suspended almost all aid to Haiti. This destabilized the
Haitian currency, the gourde, and, combined with a 40% fuel price
hike in September, caused widespread price increases. Prices appear
to have leveled off in January 2001.

@Holy See (Vatican City)




Holy See (Vatican City)    Introduction

Background: Popes in their secular role ruled much of the Italian
peninsula for more than a thousand years until the mid 19th century,
when many of the Papal States were seized by the newly united
Kingdom of Italy. In 1870, the pope's holdings were further
circumscribed when Rome itself was annexed. Disputes between a
series of "prisoner" popes and Italy were resolved in 1929 by three
Lateran Treaties, which established the independent state of Vatican
City and granted Roman Catholicism special status in Italy. In 1984,
a concordat between the Vatican and Italy modified certain of the
earlier treaty provisions, including the primacy of Roman
Catholicism as the Italian state religion. Present concerns of the
Holy See include the failing health of Pope John Paul II,
interreligious dialogue and reconciliation, and the adjustment of
church doctrine in an era of rapid change and globalization. About 1
billion people worldwide profess the Catholic faith.

Honduras    Introduction

Background: Part of Spain's vast empire in the New World, Honduras
became an independent nation in 1821. After two and one-half decades
of mostly military rule, a freely elected civilian government came
to power in 1982. During the 1980s, Honduras proved a haven for
anti-Sandinista contras fighting the Marxist Nicaraguan Government
and an ally to Salvadoran Government forces fighting against leftist
guerrillas.

@Hong Kong





Hong Kong    Introduction

Background: Occupied by the UK in 1841, Hong Kong was formally ceded
by China the following year; various adjacent lands were added later
in the 19th century. Pursuant to an agreement signed by China and
the UK on 19 December 1984, Hong Kong became the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) of China on 1 July 1997. In this
agreement, China has promised that, under its "one country, two
systems" formula, China's socialist economic system will not be
practiced in Hong Kong and that Hong Kong will enjoy a high degree
of autonomy in all matters except foreign and defense affairs for
the next 50 years.

limited, and food and raw materials must be imported. Indeed,
imports and exports, including reexports, each exceed GDP in dollar

July 1997 it had extensive trade and investment ties with China. Per
capita GDP compares with the level in the four big countries of
Western Europe. GDP growth averaged a strong 5% in 1989-97. The
widespread Asian economic difficulties in 1998 hit this

@Hungary




Hungary    Introduction

Background: Hungary was part of the polyglot Austro-Hungarian
Empire, which collapsed during World War I. The country fell under
communist rule following World War II. In 1956, a revolt and
announced withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact were met with a massive
military intervention by Moscow. In the more open GORBACHEV years,
Hungary led the movement to dissolve the Warsaw Pact and steadily
shifted toward multiparty democracy and a market-oriented economy.
Following the collapse of the USSR in 1991, Hungary developed close
political and economic ties to Western Europe. It joined NATO in
1999 and is a frontrunner in a future expansion of the EU.

Economy - overview: Hungary continues to demonstrate strong economic
growth and to work toward accession to the European Union. The
private sector accounts for over 80% of GDP. Foreign ownership of
and investment in Hungarian firms is widespread, with cumulative
foreign direct investment totaling $23 billion by 2000. Hungarian
sovereign debt was upgraded in 2000 to the second-highest rating
among all the Central European transition economies. Inflation - a
top economic concern in 2000 - is still high at almost 10%, pushed
upward by higher world oil and gas and domestic food prices.
Economic reform measures such as health care reform, tax reform, and
local government financing have not yet been addressed by the ORBAN
government.

Iceland    Introduction

Background: Settled by Norwegian and Celtic (Scottish and Irish)
immigrants during the late 9th and 10th centuries A.D., Iceland
boasts the world's oldest functioning legislative assembly, the
Althing, established in 930. Independent for over 300 years, Iceland
was subsequently ruled by Norway and Denmark. Fallout from the Askja
volcano of 1875 devastated the Icelandic economy and caused
widespread famine. Over the next quarter century, 20% of the
island's population emigrated, mostly to Canada and the US. Limited
home rule from Denmark was granted in 1874 and complete independence
attained in 1944. Literacy, longevity, income, and social cohesion
are first-rate by world standards.

Iceland    Economy

Economy - overview: Iceland's Scandinavian-type economy is basically
capitalistic, yet with an extensive welfare system, low
unemployment, and remarkably even distribution of income. In the
absence of other natural resources (except for abundant hydrothermal
and geothermal power), the economy depends heavily on the fishing
industry, which provides 70% of export earnings and employs 12% of
the work force. The economy remains sensitive to declining fish
stocks as well as to drops in world prices for its main exports:
fish and fish products, aluminum, and ferrosilicon. The center-right
government plans to continue its policies of reducing the budget and
current account deficits, limiting foreign borrowing, containing
inflation, revising agricultural and fishing policies, diversifying
the economy, and privatizing state-owned industries. The government
remains opposed to EU membership, primarily because of Icelanders'
concern about losing control over their fishing resources. Iceland's
economy has been diversifying into manufacturing and service
industries in the last decade, and new developments in software
production, biotechnology, and financial services are taking place.
The tourism sector is also expanding, with the recent trends in
ecotourism and whale watching. Growth has been remarkably steady
over the past five years at 4%-5%.

India    Introduction

Background: The Indus Valley civilization, one of the oldest in the
world, goes back at least 5,000 years. Aryan tribes from the
northwest invaded about 1500 B.C.; their merger with the earlier
inhabitants created classical Indian culture. Arab incursions
starting in the 8th century and Turkish in 12th were followed by
European traders beginning in the late 15th century. By the 19th
century, Britain had assumed political control of virtually all
Indian lands. Nonviolent resistance to British colonialism under
Mohandas GANDHI and Jawaharlal NEHRU led to independence in 1947.
The subcontinent was divided into the secular state of India and the
smaller Muslim state of Pakistan. A third war between the two
countries in 1971 resulted in East Pakistan becoming the separate
nation of Bangladesh. Fundamental concerns in India include the
ongoing dispute with Pakistan over Kashmir, massive overpopulation,
environmental degradation, extensive poverty, and ethnic strife, all
this despite impressive gains in economic investment and output.

@Indian Ocean

Indian Ocean    Introduction Top of Page

Background: The Indian Ocean is the third-largest of the world's
five oceans (after the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean, but larger
than the Southern Ocean and Arctic Ocean). Four critically important
access waterways are the Suez Canal (Egypt), Bab el Mandeb
(Djibouti-Yemen), Strait of Hormuz (Iran-Oman), and Strait of
Malacca (Indonesia-Malaysia). The decision by the International
Hydrographic Organization in the spring of 2000 to delimit a fifth
ocean, the Southern Ocean, removed the portion of the Indian Ocean
south of 60 degrees south.



Indian Ocean    Geography

Location: body of water between Africa, the Southern Ocean, Asia,
and Australia

Geographic coordinates: 20 00 S, 80 00 E

Map references: World

Area: total:  68.556 million sq km

note:  includes Andaman Sea, Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal, Great
Australian Bight, Gulf of Aden, Gulf of Oman, Mozambique Channel,
Persian Gulf, Red Sea, Strait of Malacca, and other tributary water
bodies

Area - comparative: about 5.5 times the size of the US

Coastline: 66,526 km

Climate: northeast monsoon (December to April), southwest monsoon
(June to October); tropical cyclones occur during May/June and
October/November in the northern Indian Ocean and January/February
in the southern Indian Ocean

Terrain: surface dominated by counterclockwise gyre (broad, circular
system of currents) in the southern Indian Ocean; unique reversal of
surface currents in the northern Indian Ocean; low atmospheric
pressure over southwest Asia from hot, rising, summer air results in
the southwest monsoon and southwest-to-northeast winds and currents,
while high pressure over northern Asia from cold, falling, winter
air results in the northeast monsoon and northeast-to-southwest
winds and currents; ocean floor is dominated by the Mid-Indian Ocean
Ridge and subdivided by the Southeast Indian Ocean Ridge, Southwest
Indian Ocean Ridge, and Ninetyeast Ridge

Elevation extremes: lowest point:  Java Trench -7,258 m

highest point:  sea level 0 m

Natural resources: oil and gas fields, fish, shrimp, sand and gravel
aggregates, placer deposits, polymetallic nodules

Natural hazards: occasional icebergs pose navigational hazard in
southern reaches

Environment - current issues: endangered marine species include the
dugong, seals, turtles, and whales; oil pollution in the Arabian
Sea, Persian Gulf, and Red Sea

Geography - note: major chokepoints include Bab el Mandeb, Strait of
Hormuz, Strait of Malacca, southern access to the Suez Canal, and
the Lombok Strait



Indian Ocean    Economy

Economy - overview: The Indian Ocean provides major sea routes
connecting the Middle East, Africa, and East Asia with Europe and
the Americas. It carries a particularly heavy traffic of petroleum
and petroleum products from the oilfields of the Persian Gulf and
Indonesia. Its fish are of great and growing importance to the
bordering countries for domestic consumption and export. Fishing
fleets from Russia, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan also exploit the
Indian Ocean, mainly for shrimp and tuna. Large reserves of
hydrocarbons are being tapped in the offshore areas of Saudi Arabia,
Iran, India, and western Australia. An estimated 40% of the world's
offshore oil production comes from the Indian Ocean. Beach sands
rich in heavy minerals and offshore placer deposits are actively
exploited by bordering countries, particularly India, South Africa,
Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.



Indian Ocean    Transportation

Ports and harbors: Chennai (Madras; India), Colombo (Sri Lanka),
Durban (South Africa), Jakarta (Indonesia), Kolkata (Calcutta;

@Indonesia




Indonesia    Introduction

Background: The world's largest archipelago, Indonesia achieved
independence from the Netherlands in 1949. Current issues include:
implementing IMF-mandated reforms of the banking sector, effecting a
transition to a popularly elected government after four decades of
authoritarianism, addressing charges of cronyism and corruption,
holding the military accountable for human rights violations, and
resolving growing separatist pressures in Aceh and Irian Jaya. On 30
August 1999 a provincial referendum for independence was
overwhelmingly approved by the people of Timor Timur. Concurrence
followed by Indonesia's national legislature, and the name East
Timor was provisionally adopted. The independent status of East
Timor - now under UN administration - has yet to be formally

Indonesia    Economy

will remain low and few new jobs will be created under these
circumstances. Growth of 4.8% in 2000 is not sustainable, being
attributable to favorable short-term factors, including high world

Iran    Introduction

Background: Known as Persia until 1935, Iran became an Islamic
republic in 1979 after the ruling shah was forced into exile.
Conservative clerical forces subsequently crushed westernizing
liberal elements. Militant Iranian students seized the US Embassy in
Tehran on 4 November 1979 and held it until 20 January 1981. During
1980-88, Iran fought a bloody, indecisive war with Iraq over
disputed territory. The key current issue is how rapidly the country
should open up to the modernizing influences of the outside world.

Iran    Economy

Economy - overview: Iran's economy is a mixture of central planning,
state ownership of oil and other large enterprises, village
agriculture, and small-scale private trading and service ventures.
President KHATAMI has continued to follow the market reform plans of
former President RAFSANJANI and has indicated that he will pursue
diversification of Iran's oil-reliant economy although he has made
little progress toward that goal. The strong oil market in 1996
helped ease financial pressures on Iran and allowed for Tehran's
timely debt service payments. Iran's financial situation tightened
in 1997 and deteriorated further in 1998 because of lower oil
prices. The subsequent zoom in oil prices in 1999-2000 afforded Iran
fiscal breathing room but does not solve Iran's structural economic
problems, including the encouragement of foreign investment.

concerning border demarcation, prisoners-of-war, and freedom of
navigation and sovereignty over the Shatt al Arab waterway; Iran
occupies two islands in the Persian Gulf claimed by the UAE: Lesser
Tunb (called Tunb as Sughra in Arabic by UAE and Jazireh-ye Tonb-e
Kuchek in Persian by Iran) and Greater Tunb (called Tunb al Kubra in
Arabic by UAE and Jazireh-ye Tonb-e Bozorg in Persian by Iran); Iran
jointly administers with the UAE an island in the Persian Gulf
claimed by the UAE (called Abu Musa in Arabic by UAE and Jazireh-ye
Abu Musa in Persian by Iran) - over which Iran has taken steps to
exert unilateral control since 1992, including access restrictions
and a military build-up on the island; the UAE has garnered
significant diplomatic support in the region in protesting these
Iranian actions; Caspian Sea boundaries are not yet determined among
Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Turkmenistan

Illicit drugs: despite substantial interdiction efforts, Iran
remains a key transshipment point for Southwest Asian heroin to
Europe; domestic consumption of narcotics remains a persistent
problem and Iranian press reports estimate that there are at least
1.2 million drug users in the country

Iraq    Introduction

Background: Formerly part of the Ottoman Empire, Iraq became an
independent kingdom in 1932. A "republic" was proclaimed in 1958,
but in actuality a series of military strongmen have ruled the
country since then, the latest being SADDAM Husayn. Territorial
disputes with Iran led to an inconclusive and costly eight-year war
(1980-1988). In August 1990 Iraq seized Kuwait, but was expelled by
US-led, UN coalition forces during January-February 1991. The
victors did not occupy Iraq, however, thus allowing the regime to
stay in control. Following Kuwait's liberation, the UN Security
Council (UNSC) required Iraq to scrap all weapons of mass
destruction and long-range missiles and to allow UN verification
inspections. UN trade sanctions remain in effect due to incomplete
Iraqi compliance with relevant UNSC resolutions.

Iraq    Economy

Economy - overview: Iraq's economy is dominated by the oil sector,
which has traditionally provided about 95% of foreign exchange
earnings. In the 1980s, financial problems caused by massive
expenditures in the eight-year war with Iran and damage to oil
export facilities by Iran led the government to implement austerity
measures, borrow heavily, and later reschedule foreign debt
payments; Iraq suffered economic losses of at least $100 billion
from the war. After the end of hostilities in 1988, oil exports
gradually increased with the construction of new pipelines and
restoration of damaged facilities. Iraq's seizure of Kuwait in
August 1990, subsequent international economic sanctions, and damage
from military action by an international coalition beginning in
January 1991 drastically reduced economic activity. Although
government policies supporting large military and internal security
forces and allocating resources to key supporters of the regime have
hurt the economy, implementation of the UN's oil-for-food program in
December 1996 has helped improve conditions for the average Iraqi
citizen. For the first six, six-month phases of the program, Iraq
was allowed to export limited amounts of oil in exchange for food,
medicine, and some infrastructure spare parts. In December 1999, the
UN Security Council authorized Iraq to export under the program as
much oil as required to meet humanitarian needs. Oil exports are now
more than three-quarters their prewar level. Per capita food imports
have increased significantly, while medical supplies and health care
services are steadily improving. Per capita output and living
standards are still well below the prewar level, but any estimates
have a wide range of error.

Ireland    Introduction

Background: A failed 1916 Easter Monday Rebellion touched off
several years of guerrilla warfare that in 1921 resulted in
independence from the UK for the 26 southern counties; the six
northern counties (Ulster) remained part of Great Britain. In 1948
Ireland withdrew from the British Commonwealth; it joined the
European Community in 1973. Irish governments have sought the
peaceful unification of Ireland and have cooperated with Britain
against terrorist groups. A peace settlement for Northern Ireland,
approved in 1998, was implemented the following year.

Ireland    Economy

Economy - overview: Ireland is a small, modern, trade-dependent
economy with growth averaging a robust 9% in 1995-2000. Agriculture,
once the most important sector, is now dwarfed by industry, which
accounts for 38% of GDP and about 80% of exports and employs 28% of
the labor force. Although exports remain the primary engine for
Ireland's robust growth, the economy is also benefiting from a rise
in consumer spending and recovery in both construction and business
investment. Over the past decade, the Irish government has
implemented a series of national economic programs designed to curb
inflation, reduce government spending, increase labor force skills,
and promote foreign investment. Ireland joined in launching the euro
currency system in January 1999 along with 10 other EU nations. The
Irish economy is in danger of overheating, with the tight labor
market driving up wage demands and inflation.

Israel    Introduction

Background: Following World War II, the British withdrew from their
mandate of Palestine, and the UN partitioned the area into Arab and
Jewish states, an arrangement rejected by the Arabs. Subsequently,
the Israelis defeated the Arabs in a series of wars without ending
the deep tensions between the two sides. The territories occupied by
Israel since the 1967 war are not included in the Israel country
profile, unless otherwise noted. In keeping with the framework
established at the Madrid Conference in October 1991, bilateral
negotiations are being conducted between Israel and Palestinian
representatives (from the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip)
and Israel and Syria, to achieve a permanent settlement. On 25 April
1982, Israel withdrew from the Sinai pursuant to the 1979
Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty. Outstanding territorial and other
disputes with Jordan were resolved in the 26 October 1994
Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace. On 25 May 2000, Israel withdrew
unilaterally from southern Lebanon, which it had occupied since 1982.

Israel    Economy

Economy - overview: Israel has a technologically advanced market
economy with substantial government participation. It depends on
imports of crude oil, grains, raw materials, and military equipment.
Despite limited natural resources, Israel has intensively developed
its agricultural and industrial sectors over the past 20 years.
Israel is largely self-sufficient in food production except for
grains. Cuts diamonds, high-technology equipment, and agricultural
products (fruits and vegetables) are the leading exports. Israel
usually posts sizable current account deficits, which are covered by
large transfer payments from abroad and by foreign loans. Roughly
half of the government's external debt is owed to the US, which is
its major source of economic and military aid. The influx of Jewish
immigrants from the former USSR topped 750,000 during the period
1989-99, bringing the population of Israel from the former Soviet
Union to 1 million, one-sixth of the total population, and adding
scientific and professional expertise of substantial value for the
economy's future. The influx, coupled with the opening of new
markets at the end of the Cold War, energized Israel's economy,
which grew rapidly in the early 1990s. But growth began moderating
in 1996 when the government imposed tighter fiscal and monetary
policies and the immigration bonus petered out. Growth was a strong
5.9% in 2000. But the outbreak of Palestinian unrest in late
September and the collapse of the BARAK Government - coupled with a
cooling off in the high-technology and tourist sectors - undercut
the boom and foreshadows a slowdown to 2%-3% in 2001.

Italy    Introduction

Background: Italy became a nation-state belatedly - in 1861 when the
city-states of the peninsula, along with Sardinia and Sicily, were
united under King Victor EMMANUEL. An era of parliamentary
government came to a close in the early 1920s when Benito MUSSOLINI
established a Fascist dictatorship. His disastrous alliance with
Nazi Germany led to Italy's defeat in World War II. A democratic
republic replaced the monarchy in 1946 and economic revival
followed. Italy was a charter member of NATO and the European
Economic Community (EEC). It has been at the forefront of European
economic and political unification, joining the European Monetary
Union in 1999. Persistent problems include illegal immigration, the
ravages of organized crime, corruption, high unemployment, and the
low incomes and technical standards of southern Italy compared with
the more prosperous north.

Italy    Economy

Economy - overview: Italy has a diversified industrial economy with
roughly the same total and per capita output as France and the UK.
This capitalistic economy remains divided into a developed
industrial north, dominated by private companies, and a less
developed agricultural south, with more than 20% unemployment. Most
raw materials needed by industry and more than 75% of energy
requirements are imported. Since 1992, Italy has adopted budgets
compliant with the requirements of the European Monetary Union
(EMU); wage moderation agreements by representatives of government,
labor, and employers have helped to bring Italy's inflation into
conformity with EMU requirements. Italy's economic performance,
however, has lagged behind that of its EU partners and it must work
to stimulate employment, promote labor flexibility, reform its
expensive pension system, and tackle the informal economy.

Background: Jamaica gained full independence within the British
Commonwealth in 1962. Deteriorating economic conditions during the

Subsequent governments have been open market oriented. Political
violence marred elections during the 1990s.

Jamaica    Economy

Economy - overview: Key sectors in this island economy are bauxite
(alumina and bauxite account for more than half of exports) and
tourism. Since assuming office in 1992, Prime Minister PATTERSON has
eliminated most price controls, streamlined tax schedules, and
privatized government enterprises. Continued tight monetary and
fiscal policies have helped slow inflation - although inflationary
pressures are mounting - and stabilize the exchange rate, but have
resulted in the slowdown of economic growth (moving from 1.5% in
1992 to 0.5% in 1995). In 1996, GDP showed negative growth (-1.4%)
and remained negative through 1999. Serious problems include: high
interest rates; increased foreign competition; the weak financial
condition of business in general resulting in receiverships or
closures and downsizings of companies; the shift in investment
portfolios to non-productive, short-term high yield instruments; a
pressured, sometimes sliding, exchange rate; a widening merchandise
trade deficit; and a growing internal debt for government bailouts
to various ailing sectors of the economy, particularly the financial
sector. Depressed economic conditions in 1999-2000 led to increased
civil unrest, including a mounting crime rate. Jamaica's medium-term
prospects will depend upon encouraging investment in the productive
sectors, maintaining a competitive exchange rate, stabilizing the
labor environment, selling off reacquired firms, and implementing
proper fiscal and monetary policies.

@Jan Mayen





Jan Mayen    Introduction

Background: This desolate, mountainous island was named after a
Dutch whaling captain who indisputably discovered it in 1614
(earlier claims are inconclusive). Visited only occasionally by seal
hunters and trappers over the following centuries, the island came
under Norwegian sovereignty in 1929. The long dormant Beerenberg
volcano resumed activity in 1970; it is the northernmost active
volcano on earth.

@Japan




Japan    Introduction

Background: While retaining its time-honored culture, Japan rapidly
absorbed Western technology during the late 19th and early 20th
centuries. After its devastating defeat in World War II, Japan
recovered to become the second most powerful economy in the world
and a staunch ally of the US. While the emperor retains his throne
as a symbol of national unity, actual power rests in networks of
powerful politicians, bureaucrats, and business executives. The
economy experienced a major slowdown in the 1990s following three
decades of unprecedented growth.

Japan    Economy

Economy - overview: Government-industry cooperation, a strong work
ethic, mastery of high technology, and a comparatively small defense
allocation (1% of GDP) have helped Japan advance with extraordinary
rapidity to the rank of second most technologically powerful economy
in the world after the US and third largest economy in the world
after the US and China. One notable characteristic of the economy is
the working together of manufacturers, suppliers, and distributors
in closely-knit groups called keiretsu. A second basic feature has
been the guarantee of lifetime employment for a substantial portion
of the urban labor force. Both features are now eroding. Industry,
the most important sector of the economy, is heavily dependent on
imported raw materials and fuels. The much smaller agricultural
sector is highly subsidized and protected, with crop yields among
the highest in the world. Usually self-sufficient in rice, Japan
must import about 50% of its requirements of other grain and fodder
crops. Japan maintains one of the world's largest fishing fleets and
accounts for nearly 15% of the global catch. For three decades
overall real economic growth had been spectacular: a 10% average in
the 1960s, a 5% average in the 1970s, and a 4% average in the 1980s.
Growth slowed markedly in the 1990s largely because of the
aftereffects of overinvestment during the late 1980s and
contractionary domestic policies intended to wring speculative
excesses from the stock and real estate markets. Government efforts
to revive economic growth have met little success and were further
hampered in late 2000 by the slowing of the US and Asian economies.
The crowding of habitable land area and the aging of the population
are two major long-run problems. Robotics constitutes a key
long-term economic strength, with Japan possessing 410,000 of the
world's 720,000 "working robots".

@Jarvis Island




Jarvis Island    Introduction

Background: First discovered by the British in 1821, the uninhabited
island was annexed by the US in 1858, but abandoned in 1879 after
tons of guano had been removed. The UK annexed the island in 1889,
but never carried out plans for further exploitation. The US
occupied and reclaimed the island in 1935. Abandoned after World War
II, the island is currently a National Wildlife Refuge administered
by the US Department of the Interior; a day beacon is situated near
the middle of the west coast.

Jersey    Economy

Economy - overview: The economy is based largely on international
financial services, agriculture, and tourism. Potatoes, cauliflower,
tomatoes, and especially flowers are important export crops, shipped
mostly to the UK. The Jersey breed of dairy cattle is known
worldwide and represents an important export income earner. Milk
products go to the UK and other EU countries. In 1996 the finance
sector accounted for about 60% of the island's output. Tourism,
another mainstay of the economy, accounts for 24% of GDP. In recent
years, the government has encouraged light industry to locate in
Jersey, with the result that an electronics industry has developed
alongside the traditional manufacturing of knitwear. All raw
material and energy requirements are imported, as well as a large
share of Jersey's food needs. Light taxes and death duties make the
island a popular tax haven.

@Johnston Atoll





Johnston Atoll    Introduction

Background: Both the US and the Kingdom of Hawaii annexed Johnston
Atoll in 1858, but it was the US that mined the guano deposits until
the late 1880s. The US Navy took over the atoll in 1934, and
subsequently the US Air Force assumed control in 1948. The site was
used for high altitude nuclear tests in the 1950s and 1960s, and
until late in 2000 the atoll was maintained as a storage and
disposal site for chemical weapons. Munitions destruction is now
complete, and cleanup and closure of the facility is progressing.

@Jordan




Jordan    Introduction

Background: For most of its history since independence from British
administration in 1946, Jordan was ruled by King HUSSEIN
(1953-1999). A pragmatic ruler, he successfully navigated competing
pressures from the major powers (US, USSR, and UK), various Arab
states, Israel, and a large internal Palestinian population, through
several wars and coup attempts. In 1989 he resumed parliamentary
elections and gradually permitted political liberalization; in 1994
a formal peace treaty was signed with Israel. King ABDALLAH II - the
eldest son of King HUSSEIN and Princess MUNA - assumed the throne
following his father's death in February 1999. Since then, he has
consolidated his power and established his domestic priorities.

Jordan    Economy

Economy - overview: Jordan is a small Arab country with inadequate
supplies of water and other natural resources such as oil. The
Persian Gulf crisis, which began in August 1990, aggravated Jordan's
already serious economic problems, forcing the government to stop
most debt payments and suspend rescheduling negotiations. Aid from
Gulf Arab states, worker remittances, and trade revenues contracted.
Refugees flooded the country, producing serious balance-of-payments
problems, stunting GDP growth, and straining government resources.
The economy rebounded in 1992, largely due to the influx of capital
repatriated by workers returning from the Gulf. After averaging 9%
in 1992-95, GDP growth averaged only 1.5% during 1996-99. In an
attempt to spur growth, King ABDALLAH has undertaken limited
economic reform, including partial privatization of some state-owned
enterprises and Jordan's entry in January 2000 into the World Trade
Organization (WTrO). Debt, poverty, and unemployment are fundamental
ongoing economic problems.

Kazakhstan    Introduction

Background: Native Kazakhs, a mix of Turkic and Mongol nomadic
tribes who migrated into the region in the 13th century, were rarely
united as a single nation. The area was conquered by Russia in the
18th century and Kazakhstan became a Soviet Republic in 1936. During
the 1950s and 1960s agricultural "Virgin Lands" program, Soviet
citizens were encouraged to help cultivate Kazakhstan's northern
pastures. This influx of immigrants (mostly Russians, but also some
other deported nationalities) skewed the ethnic mixture and enabled
non-Kazakhs to outnumber natives. Independence has caused many of
these newcomers to emigrate. Current issues include: developing a
cohesive national identity; expanding the development of the
country's vast energy resources and exporting them to world markets;
and continuing to strengthen relations with neighboring states and
other foreign powers.

Natural hazards: earthquakes in the south, mudslides around Almaty

Environment - current issues: radioactive or toxic chemical sites
associated with its former defense industries and test ranges are
found throughout the country and pose health risks for humans and
animals; industrial pollution is severe in some cities; because the
two main rivers which flowed into the Aral Sea have been diverted
for irrigation, it is drying up and leaving behind a harmful layer
of chemical pesticides and natural salts; these substances are then
picked up by the wind and blown into noxious dust storms; pollution
in the Caspian Sea; soil pollution from overuse of agricultural
chemicals and salination from poor infrastructure and wasteful
irrigation practices

Kazakhstan    Economy

Economy - overview: Kazakhstan, the second largest of the former
Soviet republics in territory, possesses enormous fossil fuel
reserves as well as plentiful supplies of other minerals and metals.
It also is a large agricultural - livestock and grain - producer.
Kazakhstan's industrial sector rests on the extraction and
processing of these natural resources and also on a growing
machine-building sector specializing in construction equipment,
tractors, agricultural machinery, and some defense items. The
breakup of the USSR in December 1991 and the collapse of demand for
Kazakhstan's traditional heavy industry products resulted in a
short-term contraction of the economy, with the steepest annual
decline occurring in 1994. In 1995-97, the pace of the government
program of economic reform and privatization quickened, resulting in
a substantial shifting of assets into the private sector. The
Caspian Pipeline Consortium agreement to build a new pipeline from
western Kazakhstan's Tengiz oil field to the Black Sea increases
prospects for substantially larger oil exports in several years.
Kazakhstan's economy again turned downward in 1998 with a 2% decline
in GDP due to slumping oil prices and the August financial crisis in
Russia. The recovery of international oil prices in 1999, combined
with a well-timed tenge devaluation and a bumper grain harvest,
pulled the economy out of recession in 2000. Astana has embarked
upon an industrial policy designed to diversify the economy away
from overdependence on the oil sector by developing light industry.

Kenya    Introduction

Background: Revered president and liberation struggle icon Jomo
KENYATTA led Kenya from independence until his death in 1978, when
current President Daniel Toroitich arap MOI took power in a
constitutional succession. The country was a de facto one-party
state from 1969 until 1982 when the ruling Kenya African National
Union (KANU) made itself the sole legal party in Kenya. MOI acceded
to internal and external pressure for political liberalization in
late 1991. The ethnically fractured opposition failed to dislodge
KANU from power in elections in 1992 and 1997, which were marred by
violence and fraud, but are viewed as having generally reflected the
will of the Kenyan people. The country faces a period of political
uncertainty because MOI is constitutionally required to step down at
the next elections that have to be held by early 2003.

Kenya    Economy

Economy - overview: Kenya is well placed to serve as an engine of
growth in East Africa, but its economy has been stagnating because
of poor management and uneven commitment to reform. In 1993, the
government of Kenya implemented a program of economic liberalization
and reform that included the removal of import licensing, price
controls, and foreign exchange controls. With the support of the
World Bank, IMF, and other donors, the reforms led to a brief
turnaround in economic performance following a period of negative
growth in the early 1990s. Kenya's real GDP grew 5% in 1995 and 4%
in 1996, and inflation remained under control. Growth slowed after
1997, averaging only 1.5% in 1997-2000. In 1997, political violence
damaged the tourist industry, and Kenya's Enhanced Structural
Adjustment Program lapsed due to the government's failure to
maintain reform or address public sector corruption. Severe drought
in 1999 and 2000 caused water and energy rationing and reduced
agricultural sector productivity. A new economic team was put in
place in 1999 to revitalize the reform effort, strengthen the civil
service, and curb corruption. The IMF and World Bank renewed their
support to Kenya in mid-2000, but a number of setbacks to the
economic reform program in late 2000 have renewed donor and private
sector concern about the government's commitment to sound
governance. Long-term barriers to development include electricity
shortages, inefficient government dominance of key sectors, endemic
corruption, and high population growth.

Kiribati    Economy

Economy - overview: A remote country of 33 scattered coral atolls,
Kiribati has few national resources. Commercially viable phosphate
deposits were exhausted at the time of independence from the UK in
1979. Copra and fish now represent the bulk of production and
exports. The economy has fluctuated widely in recent years. Economic
development is constrained by a shortage of skilled workers, weak
infrastructure, and remoteness from international markets. Tourism
provides more than one-fifth of GDP. The financial sector is at an
early stage of development as is the expansion of private sector
initiatives. Foreign financial aid, largely from the UK and Japan,
is a critical supplement to GDP, equal to 25%-50% of GDP in recent
years. Remittances from workers abroad account for more than $5
million each year. Performance in 2000 fell short of the 2.5% growth
in 1999, which benefited from increased copra production and
exceptionally large revenues from fishing licenses.

of about 1 million. North Korea's long-range missile development and
research into nuclear and chemical weapons are of major concern to
the international community.

Korea, North    Economy

Economy - overview: North Korea, one of the world's most centrally
planned and isolated economies, faces desperate economic conditions.
Industrial capital stock is nearly beyond repair as a result of
years of underinvestment and spare parts shortages. The nation faces
its seventh year of food shortages because of weather-related
problems, including major drought in 2000, and chronic shortages of
fertilizer and fuel. Massive international food aid deliveries have
allowed the regime to escape the major consequence of spreading
economic failure, such as mass starvation, but the population
remains vulnerable to prolonged malnutrition and deteriorating
living conditions. Large-scale military spending eats up resources
needed for expanding investment and consumption goods. In 2000, the
regime placed emphasis on expanding foreign trade links, embracing
modern technology, and attracting foreign investment, but in no way
at the expense of relinquishing central control over key national
assets or undergoing market-oriented reforms.

Korea, South    Introduction

Background: After World War II, a republic was set up in the
southern half of the Korean Peninsula while a communist-style
government was installed in the north. The Korean War (1950-53) had
US and other UN forces intervene to defend South Korea from North
Korean attacks supported by the Chinese. An armistice was signed in
1953 splitting the peninsula at the 38th parallel known as the DMZ.
Thereafter, South Korea achieved rapid economic growth, with per
capita income rising to 13 times the level of North Korea. In 1997,
the nation suffered a severe financial crisis from which it
continues to make a solid recovery. South Korea has also maintained
its commitment to democratize its political processes. In June 2000,
a historic first south-north summit took place between the south's
President KIM Dae-jung and the north's leader KIM Chong-il. In
December 2000, President KIM Dae-jung won the Noble Peace Prize for
his lifeling committment to democracy and human rights in Asia. He
is the first Korean to win a Nobel Prize.

Korea, South    Economy

Economy - overview: As one of the Four Dragons of East Asia, South
Korea has achieved an incredible record of growth. Three decades ago
GDP per capita was comparable with levels in the poorer countries of
Africa and Asia. Today its GDP per capita is seven times India's, 16
times North Korea's, and comparable to the lesser economies of the
European Union. This success through the late 1980s was achieved by
a system of close government/business ties, including directed
credit, import restrictions, sponsorship of specific industries, and
a strong labor effort. The government promoted the import of raw
materials and technology at the expense of consumer goods and
encouraged savings and investment over consumption. The Asian
financial crisis of 1997-99 exposed certain longstanding weaknesses
in South Korea's development model, including high debt/equity
ratios, massive foreign borrowing, and an undisciplined financial
sector. By 1999 GDP growth had recovered, reversing the substantial
decline of 1998. Seoul has pressed the country's largest business
groups to restructure and to strengthen their financial base. Growth
in 2001 likely will be a more sustainable rate of 5%.

Kuwait    Economy

Economy - overview: Kuwait is a small, relatively open economy with
proved crude oil reserves of about 94 billion barrels - 10% of world
reserves. Petroleum accounts for nearly half of GDP, 90% of export
revenues, and 75% of government income. Kuwait's climate limits
agricultural development. Consequently, with the exception of fish,
it depends almost wholly on food imports. About 75% of potable water
must be distilled or imported. Higher oil prices put the FY99/00
budget into a $2 billion surplus. The FY00/01 budget covers only
nine months because of a change in the fiscal year. The budget for
FY01/02, which begins 1 April, contains higher expenditures for
salaries, construction, and other general categories. Kuwait
continues its discussions with foreign oil companies to develop
fields in the northern part of the country.

Kyrgyzstan    Economy

Economy - overview: Kyrgyzstan is a small, poor, mountainous country
with a predominantly agricultural economy. Cotton, wool, and meat
are the main agricultural products and exports. Industrial exports
include gold, mercury, uranium, and electricity. Kyrgyzstan has been
one of the most progressive countries of the former Soviet Union in
carrying out market reforms. Following a successful stabilization
program, which lowered inflation from 88% in 1994 to 15% for 1997,
attention is turning toward stimulating growth. Much of the
government's stock in enterprises has been sold. Drops in production
had been severe since the breakup of the Soviet Union in December
1991, but by mid-1995 production began to recover and exports began
to increase. Pensioners, unemployed workers, and government workers
with salary arrears continue to suffer. Foreign assistance played a
substantial role in the country's economic turnaround in 1996-97.
Growth was held down to 2.1% in 1998 largely because of the
spillover from Russia's economic difficulties, but moved ahead to
3.6% in 1999 and an estimated 5.7% in 2000. The government has
adopted a series of measures to combat such persistent problems as
excessive external debt, inflation, and inadequate revenue
collection.

Laos    Economy

Economy - overview: The government of Laos - one of the few
remaining official communist states - began decentralizing control
and encouraging private enterprise in 1986. The results, starting
from an extremely low base, were striking - growth averaged 7%
during 1988-97. Reform efforts subsequently slowed, and GDP growth
dropped an average of 3 percentage points. Because Laos depends
heavily on its trade with Thailand, it was damaged by the regional
financial crisis beginning in 1997. Government mismanagement
deepened the crisis, and from June 1997 to June 1999 the Lao kip
lost 87% of its value. Laos' foreign exchange problems peaked in
September 1999 when the kip fell from 3,500 kip to the dollar to
9,000 kip to the dollar in a matter of weeks. Now that the currency
has stabilized, however, the government seems content to let the
current situation persist, despite limited government revenue and
foreign exchange reserves. A landlocked country with a primitive
infrastructure, Laos has no railroads, a rudimentary road system,
and limited external and internal telecommunications. Electricity is
available in only a few urban areas. Subsistence agriculture
accounts for half of GDP and provides 80% of total employment. For
the foreseeable future the economy will continue to depend on aid
from the IMF and other international sources; Japan is currently the
largest bilateral aid donor; aid from the former USSR/Eastern Europe
has been cut sharply.

Latvia    Introduction

Background: After a brief period of independence between the two
World Wars, Latvia was annexed by the USSR in 1940. It reestablished
its independence in 1991 following the breakup of the Soviet Union.
Although the last Russian troops left in 1994, the status of the
Russian minority (some 30% of the population) remains of concern to
Moscow. Latvia continues to revamp its economy for eventual
integration into various Western European political and economic
institutions.

Latvia    Economy

Economy - overview: In 2000, Latvia's transitional economy recovered
from the 1998 Russian financial crisis, largely due to the SKELE
government's budget stringency and a gradual reorientation of
exports toward EU countries, lessening Latvia's trade dependency on
Russia. Latvia officially joined the World Trade Organization in
February 1999 - the first Baltic state to join - and was invited at
the Helsinki EU Summit in December 1999 to begin accession talks in
early 2000. Unemployment fell to 7.8% in 2000, down from 9.6% in
1999, and 9.2% in 1998. Privatization of large state-owned utilities
and the shipping industry faced more delays in 2000, and political
instability will continue to delay completion of the privatization
process over the next year. Latvia projects 6% GDP growth, 2.5%-3.0%
inflation, and a 1.7% fiscal deficit in 2001. Preparing for EU
membership over the next few years remains a top foreign policy goal.

Lebanon    Introduction

Background: Lebanon has made progress toward rebuilding its
political institutions and regaining its national sovereignty since
1991 and the end of the devastating 16-year civil war. Under the
Ta'if Accord - the blueprint for national reconciliation - the
Lebanese have established a more equitable political system,
particularly by giving Muslims a greater say in the political
process while institutionalizing sectarian divisions in the
government. Since the end of the war, the Lebanese have conducted
several successful elections, most of the militias have been
weakened or disbanded, and the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) have
extended central government authority over about two-thirds of the
country. Hizballah, the radical Shi'a party, retains its weapons.
Syria maintains about 25,000 troops in Lebanon based mainly in
Beirut, North Lebanon, and the Bekaa Valley. Syria's troop
deployment was legitimized by the Arab League during Lebanon's civil
war and in the Ta'if Accord. Damascus justifies its continued
military presence in Lebanon by citing the continued weakness of the
LAF, Beirut's requests, and the failure of the Lebanese Government
to implement all of the constitutional reforms in the Ta'if Accord.
Israel's withdrawal from its security zone in southern Lebanon in
May of 2000, however, has emboldened some Lebanese Christians and
Druze to demand that Syria withdraw its forces as well.

Lebanon    Economy

Economy - overview: The 1975-91 civil war seriously damaged
Lebanon's economic infrastructure, cut national output by half, and
all but ended Lebanon's position as a Middle Eastern entrepot and
banking hub. Peace enabled the central government to restore control
in Beirut, begin collecting taxes, and regain access to key port and
government facilities. Economic recovery was helped by a financially
sound banking system and resilient small- and medium-scale
manufacturers. Family remittances, banking services, manufactured
and farm exports, and international aid provided the main sources of
foreign exchange. Lebanon's economy has made impressive gains since
the launch in 1993 of "Horizon 2000," the government's $20 billion
reconstruction program. Real GDP grew 8% in 1994, 7% in 1995, 4% per
year in 1996 and 1997 but slowed to 2% in 1998, -1% in 1999, and 1%
in 2000. Annual inflation fell during the course of the 1990s from
more than 100% to 0%, and foreign exchange reserves jumped from $1.4
billion to more than $6 billion. Burgeoning capital inflows have
generated foreign payments surpluses, and the Lebanese pound has
remained very stable for the past two years. Lebanon has rebuilt
much of its war-torn physical and financial infrastructure.
Solidere, a $2-billion firm, has managed the reconstruction of
Beirut's central business district; the stock market reopened in
January 1996; and international banks and insurance companies are
returning. The government nonetheless faces serious challenges in
the economic arena. It has funded reconstruction by tapping foreign
exchange reserves and by borrowing heavily - mostly from domestic
banks. The newly re-installed HARIRI government's announced policies
fail to address the ever-increasing budgetary deficits and national
debt burden. The gap between rich and poor has widened in the 1990s,
resulting in grassroots dissatisfaction over the skewed distribution
of the reconstruction's benefits.

Lesotho    Economy

Economy - overview: Small, landlocked, and mountainous, Lesotho's
primary natural resource is water. Its economy is based on
subsistence agriculture, livestock, and remittances from miners
employed in South Africa. The number of such mineworkers has
declined steadily over the past several years. A small manufacturing
base depends largely on farm products that support the milling,
canning, leather, and jute industries. Agricultural products are
exported primarily to South Africa. Proceeds from membership in a
common customs union with South Africa form the majority of
government revenue. Although drought has decreased agricultural
activity over the past few years, completion of a major hydropower
facility in January 1998 now permits the sale of water to South
Africa, generating royalties for Lesotho. The pace of substantial
privatization has increased in recent years. In December 1999, the
government embarked on a nine-month IMF staff-monitored program
aimed at structural adjustment and stabilization of macroeconomic
fundamentals. The government is in the process of applying for a
three-year successor program with the IMF under its Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility.

Liberia    Introduction

Background: Seven years of civil strife were brought to a close in
1996 when free and open presidential and legislative elections were
held. President TAYLOR now holds strong executive power with no real
political opposition. The years of fighting coupled with the flight
of most businesses have disrupted formal economic activity. A still
unsettled domestic security situation has slowed the process of
rebuilding the social and economic structure of this war-torn
country.

Liberia    Economy

Economy - overview: A civil war in 1989-96 destroyed much of
Liberia's economy, especially the infrastructure in and around
Monrovia. Many businessmen fled the country, taking capital and
expertise with them. Some returned during 1997. Many will not
return. Richly endowed with water, mineral resources, forests, and a
climate favorable to agriculture, Liberia had been a producer and
exporter of basic products, while local manufacturing, mainly
foreign owned, had been small in scope. The democratically elected
government, installed in August 1997, inherited massive
international debts and currently relies on revenues from its
maritime registry to provide the bulk of its foreign exchange
earnings. The restoration of the infrastructure and the raising of
incomes in this ravaged economy depend on the implementation of
sound macro- and micro-economic policies of the new government,
including the encouragement of foreign investment. Recent growth has
been from a low base, and continued growth will require major policy
successes.

Libya    Introduction

Background: Since he took power in a 1969 military coup, Col.
Muammar Abu Minyar al-QADHAFI has espoused his own political system
- a combination of socialism and Islam - which he calls the Third
International Theory. Viewing himself as a revolutionary leader, he
used oil funds during the 1970s and 1980s to promote his ideology
outside Libya, even supporting subversives and terrorists abroad to
hasten the end of Marxism and capitalism. Libyan military adventures
failed, e.g., the prolonged foray of Libyan troops into the Aozou
Strip in northern Chad was finally repulsed in 1987. Libyan support
for terrorism decreased after UN sanctions were imposed in 1992.
Those sanctions were suspended in April 1999.

Libya    Economy

Economy - overview: The socialist-oriented economy depends primarily
upon revenues from the oil sector, which contributes practically all
export earnings and about one-quarter of GDP. These oil revenues and
a small population give Libya one of the highest per capita GDPs in
Africa, but little of this income flows down to the lower orders of
society. In this statist society, import restrictions and
inefficient resource allocations have led to periodic shortages of
basic goods and foodstuffs. The nonoil manufacturing and
construction sectors, which account for about 20% of GDP, have
expanded from processing mostly agricultural products to include the
production of petrochemicals, iron, steel, and aluminum. Climatic
conditions and poor soils severely limit agricultural output, and
Libya imports about 75% of its food requirements. Higher oil prices
in 1999 and 2000 led to an increase in export revenues, which
improved macroeconomic balances and helped to stimulate the economy.
Following the suspension of UN sanctions in 1999, Libya has been
trying to increase its attractiveness to foreign investors, and
several foreign companies have visited in search of contracts.

Liechtenstein    Introduction

Background: The Principality of Liechtenstein was established within
the Holy Roman Empire in 1719; it became a sovereign state in 1806.
Until the end of World War I, it was closely tied to Austria, but
the economic devastation caused by that conflict forced
Liechtenstein to conclude a customs and monetary union with
Switzerland. Since World War II (in which Liechtenstein remained
neutral) the country's low taxes have spurred outstanding economic
growth. However, shortcomings in banking regulatory oversight have
resulted in concerns about the use of the financial institutions for
money laundering.

Liechtenstein    Economy

Economy - overview: Despite its small size and limited natural
resources, Liechtenstein has developed into a prosperous, highly
industrialized, free-enterprise economy with a vital financial
service sector and living standards on a par with the urban areas of
its large European neighbors. Low business taxes - the maximum tax
rate is 18% - and easy incorporation rules have induced 73,700
holding or so-called letter box companies to establish nominal
offices in Liechtenstein, providing 30% of state revenues. The
country participates in a customs union with Switzerland and uses
the Swiss franc as its national currency. It imports more than 90%
of its energy requirements. Liechtenstein has been a member of the
European Economic Area (an organization serving as a bridge between
European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and EU) since May 1995. The
government is working to harmonize its economic policies with those
of an integrated Europe.

Lithuania    Introduction

Background: Independent between the two World Wars, Lithuania was
annexed by the USSR in 1940. On 11 March 1990, Lithuania became the
first of the Soviet republics to declare its independence, but this
proclamation was not generally recognized until September of 1991
(following the abortive coup in Moscow). The last Russian troops
withdrew in 1993. Lithuania subsequently has restructured its
economy for eventual integration into Western European institutions.

Lithuania    Economy

Economy - overview: Lithuania, the Baltic state that has conducted
the most trade with Russia, has been slowly rebounding from the 1998
Russian financial crisis. High unemployment and weak consumption
have held back recovery. GDP growth for 2000 - estimated at 2.9% -
fell behind that of Estonia and Latvia, and unemployment is
estimated at 10.8%, the country's highest since regaining
independence in 1990. For 2001, Lithuanians forecast 3.2% growth,
1.8% inflation, and a fiscal deficit of 3.3%. In early 2001, the
Lithuanian Government announced that it will repeg its currency, the
litas, to the euro (the litas is currently pegged to the dollar)
some time in 2002. Lithuania must ratify 25 agreements along with
other legal documents and obligations by 1 May 2001 before gaining
World Trade Organization membership. Lithuania was invited to the
Helsinki summit in December 1999 and began EU accession talks in
early 2000. Privatization of the large, state-owned utilities,
particularly in the energy sector, remains a key challenge for 2001.

Luxembourg    Introduction

Background: Founded in 963, Luxembourg became a grand duchy in 1815
and an independent state under the Netherlands. It lost more than
half of its territory to Belgium in 1839, but gained a larger
measure of autonomy. Full independence was attained in 1867. Overrun
by Germany in both World Wars, it ended its neutrality in 1948 when
it entered into the Benelux Customs Union and when it joined NATO
the following year. In 1957, Luxembourg became one of the six
founding countries of the European Economic Community (later the
European Union) and in 1999 it joined the euro currency area.

December 1999. China has promised that, under its "one country, two
systems" formula, China's socialist economic system will not be
practiced in Macau and that Macau will enjoy a high degree of
autonomy in all matters except foreign and defense affairs.

Macau    Economy

Economy - overview: The economy is based largely on tourism
(including gambling) and textile and fireworks manufacturing.
Efforts to diversify have spawned other small industries - toys,
artificial flowers, and electronics. The tourist sector has
accounted for roughly 25% of GDP, and the clothing industry has
provided about three-fourths of export earnings; the gambling
industry probably represents over 40% of GDP. More than 8 million
tourists visited Macau in 2000. Macau depends on China for most of

the main suppliers of raw materials and capital goods. Output
dropped 5% in 1998 and 3% in 1999, with a small 2% gain in 2000.
Macau reverted to Chinese administration on 20 December 1999. Gang
violence, a dark spot in the economy, probably will be reduced in
2000-01 to the advantage of the tourism sector.

@Macedonia, The Former Yugoslav Republic



Macedonia, The Former Yugoslav Republic of    Introduction Top of
Page

Background: International recognition of The Former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia's (FYROM) independence from Yugoslavia in 1991
was delayed by Greece's objection to the new state's use of what it
considered a Hellenic name and symbols. Greece finally lifted its
trade blockade in 1995, and the two countries agreed to normalize
relations, despite continued disagreement over FYROM's use of
"Macedonia." FYROM's large Albanian minority and the de facto
independence of neighboring Kosovo continue to be sources of ethnic
tension.

Macedonia, The Former Yugoslav Republic of    Economy

Economy - overview: At independence in November 1991, Macedonia was
the least developed of the Yugoslav republics, producing a mere 5%
of the total federal output of goods and services. The collapse of
Yugoslavia ended transfer payments from the center and eliminated
advantages from inclusion in a de facto free trade area. An absence
of infrastructure, UN sanctions on its largest market Yugoslavia,
and a Greek economic embargo hindered economic growth until 1996.
GDP has subsequently increased each year, rising by 5% in 2000.
Successful privatization in 2000 boosted the country's reserves to
over $700 million. Also, the leadership demonstrated a continuing
commitment to economic reform, free trade, and regional integration.
Inflation jumped to 11% in 2000, largely due to higher oil prices.

Madagascar    Economy

Economy - overview: Madagascar faces problems of chronic
malnutrition, underfunded health and education facilities, a roughly
3% annual population growth rate, and severe loss of forest cover,
accompanied by erosion. Agriculture, including fishing and forestry,
is the mainstay of the economy, accounting for 30% of GDP and
contributing more than 70% to export earnings. Industry features
textile manufacturing and the processing of agricultural products.
Growth in output in 1992-97 averaged less than the growth rate of
the population. Growth has been held back by antigovernment strikes
and demonstrations, a decline in world coffee prices, and the
erratic commitment of the government to economic reform. The extent
of government reforms, outside financial aid, and foreign investment
will be key determinants of future growth. For 2001, growth should
again be about 5%.

Malawi    Economy

Economy - overview: Landlocked Malawi ranks among the world's least
developed countries. The economy is predominately agricultural, with
about 90% of the population living in rural areas. Agriculture
accounts for 37% of GDP and 85% of export revenues. The economy
depends on substantial inflows of economic assistance from the IMF,
the World Bank, and individual donor nations. In late 2000, Malawi
was approved for relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) program. The government faces strong challenges, e.g., to
fully develop a market economy, to improve educational facilities,
to face up to environmental problems, and to deal with the rapidly
growing problem of HIV/AIDS.

Malaysia    Economy

Economy - overview: GDP grew at 8.6% in 2000, mainly on the strength
of double-digit export growth and continued government fiscal
stimulus. As an oil exporter, Malaysia also benefited from higher
petroleum prices. Higher export revenues allowed the country to
register a current account surplus, but foreign exchange reserves
have been declining - from a peak of $34.5 billion in April 2000 to
$29.7 billion by December - as foreign investors pulled money out of
the country. Despite this development, Kuala Lumpur is unlikely to
abandon its currency peg soon. An economic slowdown in key Western
markets, especially the United States, and lower world demand for
electronics products will slow GDP growth to 3%-6% in 2001,
according to private forecasters. Over the longer term, Malaysia's
failure to make substantial progress on key reforms of the corporate
and financial sectors clouds prospects for sustained growth and the
return of critical foreign investment.

Maldives    Economy

Economy - overview: Tourism, Maldives largest industry, accounts for
20% of GDP and more than 60% of the Maldives' foreign exchange
receipts. Over 90% of government tax revenue comes from import
duties and tourism-related taxes. Almost 400,000 tourists visited
the islands in 1998. Fishing is a second leading sector. The
Maldivian Government began an economic reform program in 1989
initially by lifting import quotas and opening some exports to the
private sector. Subsequently, it has liberalized regulations to
allow more foreign investment. Agriculture and manufacturing
continue to play a minor role in the economy, constrained by the
limited availability of cultivable land and the shortage of domestic
labor. Most staple foods must be imported. Industry, which consists
mainly of garment production, boat building, and handicrafts,
accounts for about 18% of GDP. Maldivian authorities worry about the
impact of erosion and possible global warming on their low-lying
country; 80% of the area is one meter or less above sea level.

Mali    Introduction

Background: The Sudanese Republic and Senegal became independent of
France in 1960 as the Mali Federation. When Senegal withdrew after
only a few months, the Sudanese Republic was renamed Mali. Rule by
dictatorship was brought to a close in 1991 with a transitional
government, and in 1992 when Mali's first democratic presidential
election was held. Since his reelection in 1997, President KONARE
has continued to push through political and economic reforms and to
fight corruption. In 1999 he indicated he would not run for a third
term.

Mali    Economy

Economy - overview: Mali is among the poorest countries in the
world, with 65% of its land area desert or semidesert. Economic
activity is largely confined to the riverine area irrigated by the
Niger. About 10% of the population is nomadic and some 80% of the
labor force is engaged in farming and fishing. Industrial activity
is concentrated on processing farm commodities. Mali is heavily
dependent on foreign aid and vulnerable to fluctuations in world
prices for cotton, its main export. In 1997, the government
continued its successful implementation of an IMF-recommended
structural adjustment program that is helping the economy grow,
diversify, and attract foreign investment. Mali's adherence to
economic reform and the 50% devaluation of the African franc in
January 1994 have pushed up economic growth to a sturdy 5% average
in 1996-2000. Growth should remain around 5% in 2001-02, and
inflation should stay less than 2%.

island has become a major freight transshipment point, financial
center, and tourist destination. It is an official candidate for EU
membership.

Malta    Economy

Economy - overview: Major resources are limestone, a favorable
geographic location, and a productive labor force. Malta produces
only about 20% of its food needs, has limited freshwater supplies,
and has no domestic energy sources. The economy is dependent on
foreign trade, manufacturing (especially electronics and textiles),
and tourism. Malta is privatizing state-controlled firms and
liberalizing markets in order to prepare for membership in the
European Union. However, the island is divided politically over the
question of joining the EU. The sizable budget deficit remains a key
concern.

Marshall Islands    Economy

Economy - overview: US Government assistance is the mainstay of this
tiny island economy. Agricultural production is concentrated on
small farms, and the most important commercial crops are coconuts,
tomatoes, melons, and breadfruit. Small-scale industry is limited to
handicrafts, fish processing, and copra. The tourist industry, now a
small source of foreign exchange employing less than 10% of the
labor force, remains the best hope for future added income. The
islands have few natural resources, and imports far exceed exports.
Under the terms of the Compact of Free Association, the US provides
roughly $65 million in annual aid. Negotiations were underway in
1999 for an extended agreement. Government downsizing, drought, a
drop in construction, and the decline in tourism and foreign
investment due to the Asian financial difficulties caused GDP to
fall in 1996-98.

Martinique    Economy

Economy - overview: The economy is based on sugarcane, bananas,
tourism, and light industry. Agriculture accounts for about 6% of
GDP and the small industrial sector for 11%. Sugar production has
declined, with most of the sugarcane now used for the production of
rum. Banana exports are increasing, going mostly to France. The bulk
of meat, vegetable, and grain requirements must be imported,
contributing to a chronic trade deficit that requires large annual
transfers of aid from France. Tourism has become more important than
agricultural exports as a source of foreign exchange. The majority
of the work force is employed in the service sector and in
administration.

Mauritania    Introduction

Background: Independent from France in 1960, Mauritania annexed the
southern third of the former Spanish Sahara (now Western Sahara) in
1976, but relinquished it after three years of raids by the
Polisario guerrilla front seeking independence for the territory.
Opposition parties were legalized and a new constitution approved in
1991. Two multiparty presidential elections since then were widely
seen as being flawed; Mauritania remains, in reality, a one-party
state. The country continues to experience ethnic tensions between
its black minority population and the dominant Maur (Arab-Berber)
populace.

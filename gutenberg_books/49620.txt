  “_It is absolutely necessary to meet them” [infidel writers of the
  modern school] “on their own ground, and fight them with their
  own weapons. And this is what the little book at the head of this
  article professes to do; and it does its work well. It is learned
  and logical, and at the same time lively and entertaining. Its irony
  is very powerful and cutting, and yet it is not open to the apparent
  objection of grave and serious subjects being treated flippantly._
  _Whilst from the nature of the subject, it might fairly be entitled_
  Theological Fragments, _from the method in which the subject is
  treated it is as interesting as a collection of scenes of society_.”

STEPHEN.--LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF FRANCE. By the Right Honourable
Sir James Stephen, K.C.B., LL.D., Professor of Modern History in the
University of Cambridge. Second Edition. 2 vols. 8vo. 24_s._ cloth.

  _“These masterly Lectures by Sir James Stephen, successor to the
  lamented Professor Smythe in the University of Cambridge, although
  they take rather new ground, will be found to cast a flood of
  light on the external and internal histories of the French people,
  discussing as they do fully and with consummate ability, as was
  to be expected from the author of _Ecclesiastical Biography_,
  the monarchical, judicial, and economical institutions of the
  Great Nation.... The present Lectures are at once profound [and]
  discriminative. They are written in a style of singular fascination,
  and even to the general reader they present historical truth in
  the attractiveness of romance. We indulge the hope that they will
  attain a large circulation, especially among those classes who are
  so latetudinarian as to ignore the painful but palpable facts of
  ecclesiastical history.”_ Electic Review.

TAYLOR.--WESLEY AND METHODISM. By Isaac Taylor. With a Portrait of
Wesley. Post 8vo. 10_s._ 6_d._ cloth.

  _“All the characteristics of early Methodism are analysed in the
  present volume with a discrimination, and described with a clearness,
  such as we might expect from the philosophical and eloquent author
  of the _Natural History of Enthusiasm...._ Of the Methodism of the
  eighteenth century, the corporeal part remains in the Wesleyan
  Connexion; the soul of it, while partly animating that body, was
  transfused into all Christian Churches. How that great movement
  became a starting-point in our modern history, and how it was the
  source of what is the most characteristic of the present time, as
  contrasted with the corresponding period of last century, not in
  religion only, but in general tone of national feeling, and manners,
  and literature, Mr. Taylor ably shews.”_ Literary Gazette.

        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all

        works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

DO AUTOR

CINZAS, 1908 (Fóra do mercado)
LUAR D'OUTONO, 1912 (Exgotado)




Encheste a minha vida d'amargura.
Encheste a minha vida de martyrios.
Enchi a tua vida de ternura,
E vou encher o teu coval de lyrios.




+Dia 13+


A sombra vae cahindo lentamente.
Cahindo, amortalhando devagar
A hostia ensanguentada do poente!
Ouvem-se ao longe as fontes soluçar...

A aragem murmura docemente.
Ha preces de novena pelo ar.
A natureza ás vezes tambem sente!
Ha tardes em que o ceu sabe chorar!

As velas assustadas, pela serra,
Paráram de moêr, fitando a Terra!
Passa um enterro... «É nova, vae tão cêdo!»

Falam maguas nos olhos de quem passa...
Anda no ar um vento de Desgraça!
Amor, as tuas mãos... eu tenho mêdo!


13--Março 1916




+A vida é uma walsa...+


Naquela walsa que dansamos, lenta e linda,
Num baile onde, ao acaso, um dia te encontrei,
Sem qu'rer, fiz-te chorar. Eu lembro-me ainda!
Foi toda a minha vida... a walsa que dansei!

Senti a tua alma entrar dentro da minha;
E ouvi teu coração falar muito baixinho.
E ainda pressenti que a tua alma tinha
Anceios de contar soluços de carinho.

Sentindo as tuas mãos nas minhas a queimar,
Eu disse-te orações... e ouvi-te murmurar
Palavras que de cór meu peito diz ainda!

Vejo-te assim; juntinha a mim, d'olhos fechados...
Eu sinto que nós dois andamos abraçados,
Dansando devagar, aquela walsa linda!


1916




+Fria+


Qu'importa o teu olhar sêja tão lindo,
E tenha a côr da luz que tem o dia?
Qu'importa o teu sorriso doce, infindo,
Se és fria, como a pedra, fria, fria!

Qu'importa esse teu corpo, se não sente!?
A alvura do teu colo sempre a arfar,
Se não tem o calor que dá á gente,
A força p'ra viver e para amar?!

Amor, no teu olhar eu tenho lido aos poucos,
Anceios exquisitos, sonhos loucos...
E és fria como a louza em cemiterio!

Envolta nesse manto de Beleza,
Quando olho dos teus olhos a frieza,
Eu quedo-me a scismar nesse misterio!


1916




+Teus olhos falam maguas...+


Os teus olhos maguados dizem tanto!
Aos meus olhos, sem qu'rer, teem contado
As maguas, os sorrisos, mais o pranto,
Que teus olhos maguados tem chorado.

Teus olhos maguados vão no berço
Do meu peito, e dormem de mansinho.
Teus olhos,--Padre-Nossos--são d'um terço,
Contas d'Amor, que eu rezo tão baixinho...

Teus olhos maguados são dois beijos.
São promessas, sonhos, são desejos...
E eu trago os olhos teus no coração.

São a luz da minh'alma entristecida;
Teus olhos maguados são a Vida,
E o sol da minha vida tambem são!


1916




+Violetas rôxas+


Inda tenho as florinhas inquietas,
Que beijaram teus seios pequeninos,
Atravez d'essas rendas indiscretas,
Sob entremeios brancos e tão finos!

Flor's que dos teus labios coralinos
Ouviram confidencias tão secretas,
E que teus dedos brancos, peregrinos,
Deitaram fóra... Pobres Violetas!

Perdidas pela sala e desatadas,
Encontrei-as, as pobres, requeimadas,
Ainda cheias desse teu encanto!

Mas lá 'stão inquietas e viçosas,
As que olharam teus seios vergonhosas...
Reviveram nas aguas do meu pranto.


1916




+A minha alma já morreu...+


Eu não te disse, Amôr? Minh'alma já morreu
Cançada de esperar teus olhos num anceio!
Cançada de rezar baixinho o nome teu.
A noite era tão linda! E o teu olhar não veio!

E o teu olhar não trouxe a sombra dum carinho
Á minha pobre alma exausta de sofrer!
Luar! Tanto Luar havia no caminho...
E a luz do teu olhar não quiz vê-la morrer!

O teu olhar matou-a! E não quizeste vir
Trazer-lhe uma grinalda branca do teu rir.
Ao menos murmurar baixinho uma oração!

Amor, sempre julguei que as tuas mãos pequenas,
Branquinhas como duas açucenas,
Viessem ageitar minh'alma no caixão!


1917




+Vendida+


Vendeste a tua boca, aquela que beijára
Purinha e a sorrir, meus versos a chorar.
Vendeste as tuas mãos, febris que eu apertára,
E outr'ora já por mim se ergueram a rezar.

Vendeste o teu olhar, e o corpo airoso e lindo,
Enlevo do meu sonho, a luz do meu viver.
Vendeste o teu sorrir, sorriso doce, infindo...
Que fôra para mim alivio de sofrer!

E nem sequer tens pena! És d'el' que te comprou!
Vender's a tua boca, aquela que beijou
Meus versos a chorar por ti n'uma paixão!

És minha? És d'ele? És minha á luz do sentimento!
Tu vives d'este amor. É meu teu pensamento.
És minha! Não vendeste ainda o coração.


1917




+Um peccado+


Silhuete do Amor, corpinho d'anfora, esguia!
Olhar sonhando a rir, promessas e desejos.
Braza a queimar, a arder, acesa á luz do dia...
Boca tão linda... e boca virgem dos meus beijos!

És a esfinge da Graça! O sonho do Noivado!
Uma oração trazida á Terra, pela Virgem!
E és tambem ainda um mixto do Pecado...
A figura do Amor na tela da Vertigem!

Tu sabes quem eu sou; e crê, quando te vejo,
Eu tenho a impressão do que seria um beijo,
Em frente do Senhor, á luz do coração!

Mas tu, sorris, e ris... e eu quêdo-me a scismar,
Como seria bela a vida a recordar,
Um longo beijo teu--Peccado, e Oração!


1920




+Envôlta no "manton" das rosas vermelhas...+


Hasde ser minha, eu quero, é quanto basta!
Um dia, quando fôr, não o procuro.
E é o desejo ardente que me arrasta,
Aquel' que hade fazer vibrar-te, eu juro!

Um dia, quando fôr... heide deixar
Nos seios que tu tens, beijos aos molhos!
Nodoas de lyrios roxos a sangrar...
E olheiras côr da noite nos teus olhos!

Não tenhas ilusões! Nunca a tua Raça
Me vencerá a mim por mais que faça!
Quero-te. Eu sinto a ancia de beijar!

Queimada pelo fogo dos meus beijos
Heide sentir-te louca de desejos...
Um dia, quando fôr... sem eu te amar!


1920




+Na Praia-Mar do Sonho+


Decerto tu já viste ao sol-poente,
O mar beijar a areia de mansinho.
Parado, a olha-la docemente,
Num grande sonho, louco, de carinho.

Depois é densa a treva. O mar é louco.
E briga com a areia, encapelado.
Embravecido cança, e pouco a pouco,
Soluça a grande dôr dum revoltado!

Assim, houve luar e noite escura,
N'aquela doce noite de amargura,
Misterio indefinido que profundo!

Assim, é a tu'alma p'ra minh'alma,
--Ó minha maré-viva e maré-calma,
Do grande mar, da Dôr em que me afundo!


1920




+A mascara loira+


Ó minha viciosa, esterica e perversa,
De linhas sensuaes; teu corpo éthérisado,
Tem frases de requinte, em lubrica conversa!
Tem lume de cigarro, loiro e opiado!

Teus olhos a boiar, são taças d'absynto.
E a tua silhuete loira e desgrenhada,
Tem risos de cristaes partidos, que eu bem sinto,
Em noites de volupia, á luz da madrugada!

Á noite, as tuas mãos, são gumes de punhal,
Depois de terem morto--alguem sem fazer mal...
Tua voz é o Fado... eu ouço-o quando passa!

No Mundo és o Drama, a Farça, és a Comedia!
Ás vezes tambem és--palhaço--na Tragedia!
És a figura loira e linda da Desgraça!


1921




+Abandono+


Decerto tu sentiste o abandono,
Que vae acompanhando o sol-poente,
Nas tardes tristes, lividas, do outono,
E quando chora o coração da gente!

Tardes pedindo ao sol a Extrema-Uncção,
Numa ancia doentia de mais luz!
Decerto tu sentiste a sensação,
De ajoelhar's em frente d'uma cruz!

Tu entraste á tarde na Egreja,
Á hora de resar's--bemdita seja,
A côr tão doentia do Outono!--

Tudo sentiste... e os olhos rasos d'agua!
Que pena não sentir's a minha magua!
A vaga incompreensão d'este abandono!


1921




+13 lyrios+

Atei-os com os fios d'oiro daquela taça de
crystal «bohème» que partiste...


Encheste a minha vida d'amargura.
Encheste a minha vida de martyrios.
Enchi a tua vida de ternura,
E vou encher o teu coval de lyrios.

São 13 os lyrios roxos que levei.
--Meus versos de saudade são p'ra ti.
Amor, num dia 13 te encontrei!
Num dia 13, Amor, eu te perdi.

Meu doce Amor perdido... heide te vêr,
Na luz que tem o céo ámanhecer,
Na côr do sol-poente em que reparo!

E o nome que tiveste, ó loira e linda,
Que certa rosa branca fala ainda...
Será p'la vida fôra o meu amparo!

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

INCIPIT PROLOGUS

IN VIRGILII ENEADOS.


  Lawd, honour, praysyngis, thankis infynyte
  To the and thy dulce ornat fresch endyte,
  Maist reuerend Virgill, of Latyn poetis prynce,
  Gem of engyne and flude of eloquens.
  Thou peirles perle, patroun of poetry,                               5
  Roys, regester, palm, lawrer, and glory,
  Chosyn charbukkil, cheif flour, and cedyr tre,
  Lantarn, laid stern, myrrour, and A per se,
  Maister of masteris, sweit sours, and spryngand well,
  Wyde quhar our all rung is thyne hevynly bell;                      10
  I meyn thy crafty warkis curyus,
  Sa quyk, lusty, and maist sentencyus,
  Plesand, perfyte, and feilabill in all degre,
  As quha the mater beheld tofor thar E;
  In every volume quhilk the lyst do wryte,                           15
  Surmontyng fer all other maner endyte,
  Lyke as the roys in June with her sweit smell
  The mary guld or dasy doith excell.
  Quhy suld I than, with dull forhed and vayn,
  With rude engyne and barrand emptyve brayn,                         20
  With bad harsk spech and lewit barbour tong,
  Presume to write quhar thy sweit bell is rung,
  Or contyrfate sa precyus wordys deir?
  Na, na, noth swa, bot kneill quhen I thame heir.
  For quhat compair betwix myd day and nycht,
  Or quhat compair betwix myrknes and lycht,
  Or quhat compair is betwix blak and quhyte,                          5
  Far grettar difference betwix my blunt endyte
  And thy scharp sugurate sang Virgiliane,
  Sa wysly wrocht, with nevir a word invane.
  My waverand wyt, my cunnyng febill at all,
  My mynd mysty, thir may nocht mys a fall;                           10
  Stra for thys ignorant blabryng imperfyte,
  Besyde thy polyst termys redymyte.
  And netheles with support and correctioun,
  For naturall lufe and frendely affectioun,
  Quhilkis I beir to thy warkis and endyte;                           15
  All thocht, God wait, tharin I knaw full lyte;
  And that thy facund sentence mycht be song
  In our langage alsweill as Latyn tong,
  Alsweill, na, na, impossibill war, per de;
  Ȝit with thy leif, Virgill, to follow the,                          20
  I wald, into my rurall wlgar gros,
  Wryte sum savoryng of thyne Eneados.
  Bot fair I dreid forto disteyn the quyte,
  Throu my corruppit cadens imperfyte;
  Disteyn the, nay forsuyth, that may I nocht,                        25
  Weill may I schaw my burall bustuus thocht,
  Bot thy wark sall endur in lawd and glory,
  But spot or falt, condyng etern memory.
  Thocht I offend, onwemmyt is thy fame,
  Thyne is the thank, and myne salbe the schame.                      30
  Quha may thy versis follow in all degre,
  In bewtie, sentence, and in grauite?
  Nane is, nor was, ne ȝit salbe, trow I,
  Had, has, or sal haue sic craft in poetry.
  Of Helicon so drank thou dry the flude                               5
  That of thy copios fouth or plenitude,
  All mon purches drynk at thy sugurit tun;
  So lamp of day thou art and schynand son,
  All otheris on fors mon thar lycht beg or borrow,
  Thou art Vesper and the day stern at morow;                         10
  Thou Phebus lightnar of the planetis all,
  I not quhat dewly I the clepe sall,
  For thou art all, and sum, quhat nedis more,
  Of Latyn poetis that sens was, or before.
  Of the writis Macrobius, sans faill,                                15
  In hys gret volume clepit Saturnaill.
  Thy sawys in sic eloquens doith fleit,
  So inuentive of rethorik flowris sweit
  Thou art, and has so hie profund sentens
  Tharto perfyte but ony indigens,                                    20
  That na lovyngis ma do incres thy fame,
  Nor na reproche dymynew thy gud name.
  Bot sen I am compellit the to translait,
  And not only of my curage, God wait,
  Durst interpryse syk owtrageus foly,                                25
  Quhar I offend the les reprefe serve I;
  And that ȝe knaw at quhais instans I tuke
  Forto translait this maist excellent buke,
  I meyn Virgillis volume maist excellent,
  Set this my wark full febill be of rent,                            30
  At the request of a lord of renown
  Of ancistry nobill and illustir baroun,
  Fader of bukis, protectour to sciens and lair,
  My speciall gud lord Henry lord Sanct Clair,
  Quhilk with gret instance, diuers tymys seir,                        5
  Prayt me translait Virgill or Homeir;
  Quhais plesour suythly, as I undirstude,
  As neir conjunct to his lordschip in blude,
  So that me thocht hys request ane command,
  Half disparit this wark I tuke on hand,                             10
  Nocht fully grantand nor anys sayand ȝee,
  Bot only to assay quhou it mycht be.
  Quha mycht gaynsay a lord so gentill and kynd,
  That euer had ony curtasy in thar mynd,
  Quhilk, besyde hys innatyve pollecy,                                15
  Humanyte, curage, fredome and chevalry,
  Bukis to recollect, to reid and se,
  Has gret delyte as euer had Ptholome?
  Quharfor to hys nobilite and estait,
  Quhatso it be, this buke I dedicait,                                20
  Writtin in the langage of Scottis natioun,
  And thus I mak my protestatioun.
    Fyrst I protest, beaw schirris, be ȝour leif,
  Beis weill avisit my wark or ȝhe repreif;
  Consider it warly, reid oftar than anys,                            25
  Weill at a blenk sle poetry nocht tayn is;
  And ȝit forsuyth I set my bissy pane,
  As that I couth, to mak it braid and plane,
  Kepand na sudron bot our awyn langage,
  And spekis as I lernyt quhen I was page.                            30
  Nor ȝit sa cleyn all sudron I refus,
  Bot sum word I pronunce as nyghtbouris doys;
  Lyke as in Latyn beyn Grew termys sum,
  So me behufyt quhilum, or than be dum,
  Sum bastard Latyn, Franch, or Inglys oys,                            5
  Quhar scant was Scottis, I had nane other choys.
  Nocht for our tung is in the selwyn skant,
  Bot for that I the fowth of langage want,
  Quhar as the cullour of his properte
  To kepe the sentens tharto constrenyt me,                           10
  Or than to mak my sayng schort sum tyme,
  Mair compendyus, or to lykly my ryme.
  Tharfor gude frendis, for a gymp or a bourd,
  I pray ȝou note me nocht at euery word.
  The worthy clerk hecht Lawrens of the Vaill,                        15
  Amang Latynys a gret patron sans faill,
  Grantis quhen twelf ȝheris he had beyn diligent
  To study Virgill, skant knew he quhat he ment;
  Than thou or I, my frend, quhen we best weyn
  To haue Virgil red, vnderstand, and seyn,                           20
  The rycht sentens perchance is fer to seik;
  This wark twelf ȝheris first was in makyng eyk,
  And nocht correct quhen the poet gan deces;
  Thus for small faltis my wys frend hald thy pes.
    Adherdand to my protestatioun,                                    25
  Thocht Wilȝame Caxtoun, of Inglis natioun,
  In proys hes prent are buke of Inglis gros,
  Clepand it Virgill in Eneados,
  Quhilk that he says of Franch he did translait,
  It has na thing ado tharwith, God wait,                             30
  Ne na mair lyke than the devill and Sanct Austyne;
  Haue he na thank tharfor, bot loys hys pyne,
  So schamefully that story dyd pervert;
  I red hys wark with harmys at my hart,
  That syk a buke, but sentens or engyne,                              5
  Suldbe intitillit eftir the poet dyvyne;
  His ornate goldyn versis, mair than gilt,
  I spittit for dispyte to se swa spilt
  With sych a wyght, quhilk trewly, be myne entent,
  Knew neuer thre wordis at all quhat Virgill ment:                   10
  Sa fer he chowpis I am constrenyt to flyte.
  The thre first bukis he has ourhippyt quyte,
  Salfand a litill twychyng Polidorus,
  And the tempest furth sent by Eolus,
  And that full sempilly on hys awyn gys;                             15
  Virgill thame wrait all on ane other wys.
  For Caxton puttis in hys buke out of toyn,
  The storm furth sent by Eolus and Neptune;
  Bot quha sa redis Virgill suythfastly,
  Sall fynd Neptune salf Eneas navy.                                  20
  Me lyst nocht schaw quhou thystory of Dydo,
  Be this Caxtoun is haill pervertit so,
  That besyde quhar he fenys to follow Bocas,
  He rynnys sa fer from Virgill in mony place,
  On sa prolixt and tedyus fasson,                                    25
  So that the ferd buke of Eneadon,
  Twichand the lufe and ded of Dido queyn,
  The twa part of his volume doith conteyn,
  That in the text of Virgill, trastis me,
  The twelt part scars contenys, as ȝe may se.                        30
  The fyfte buke of the festis funerall,
  The lusty gammys, and plays palustrall,
  That is ourhippit quyte and left behynd,
  Na thing tharof ȝhe sall in Caxtoun fynd.
  The saxt buke eyk, he grantis, that wantis haill,                    5
  And, for tharof he vnderstude nocht the taill,
  He callis it fenȝeit, and nocht for to beleif;
  Sa is all Virgill perchans, for by his leif
  Juno nor Venus goddessis neuer war,
  Mercure, Neptune, Mars, nor Jupiter,                                10
  Of Fortune eik, nor hir necessite,
  Sik thingis nocht attentik ar, wait we,
  Nor ȝit admittis that quent philosophy
  Haldis sawlys hoppys fra body to body,
  And mony thingis quhilkis Virgill dyd rehers,                       15
  Thocht I thame write furthfollowand hys vers.
  Nor Caxtoun schrynkis nocht siclyke thyngis to tell
  As nocht war fabill, bot the passage to hell;
  But trastis weill, quha that ilke saxt buke knew,
  Virgill tharin ane hie philosophour hym schew,                      20
  And, vnder the clowdis of dyrk poetry,
  Hyd lyis thar mony notabill history.
  For so the poetis, be ther crafty curys,
  In similitudes, and vndir quent figuris,
  The suythfast materis to hyde and to constreyn;                     25
  All is nocht fals, traste weill, in cace thai feyn,
  Thair art is so to mak thar warkis fair,
  As in the end of Virgill I sall declair.
  Was it nocht eik als possibill Eneas,
  As Hercules or Theseus tyll hell to pas?                            30
  Quhilk is na gabbyng suythly, nor na lie,
  As Jhone Bocas in the genealogie
  Of Goddys declarys, and lyke as ȝhe may reid
  In the recolles of Troy, quha lest tak hed.
  Quha wait gyf he in visioun thydder went                             5
  By art magike, sorcery, or enchantment,
  And with his faderis sawle dyd speke and meyt,
  Or in the lyknes with sum other spreit,
  Lyke as the spreit of Samuell, I ges,
  Raysit to King Saul was by the Phitones?                            10
  I will nocht say all Virgill beyn als trew,
  But at syk thyngis ar possibill this I schew;
  Als in tha days war ma illusionys,
  By dewillich warkis and coniurationis,
  Than now thar beyn, so doith clerkis determ;                        15
  For, blissit be God, the faith is now mair ferm.
  Enewch tharof, now will I na mor sayn,
  Bot onto Caxtoun thus I turn agane.
    The namys of pepill or citeis beyn so bad
  Put by this Caxtoun, that, bot he had beyn mad,                     20
  The flude of Touyr for Tibir he had nocht write;
  All men may knaw thar he forvayt quyte.
  Palente the cite of Evander kyng,
  As Virgill playnly makis rehersyng,
  Stude quhar in Rome now stant the cheif palyce;                     25
  This sam buke eyk, in mair hepit malyce,
  On the self ryver of Touyr says playnly
  Eneas dyd hys cyte edify.
  Thus ay for Tibir Touyr puttis he,
  Quhilk mony hundreth mylis syndry be;                               30
  For sykkyrly, les than wys authoris leyn,
  Ene saw nevir Touyr with hys eyn;
  For Touyr diuidis Grece from Vngary,
  And Tibir is cheif flude of Italy;
  Touyr is kend a grayn of that ryver                                  5
  In Latyn hecht Danubium or Hyster,
  Or gyf it be Tanais he clepis sa,
  That flude diuidis Europ from Asia.
  In lyke wys eik this Caxtoun, all invane,
  Crispina clepis Sibilla Cumane,                                     10
  That in the text of Virgill, trastis ws,
  Hait Deiphebe douchtir of Glawcus,
  Quhilk was Eneas convoyar to hell.
  Quhat suld I langar on hys errouris dwell?
  Thai beyn so playn, and eik sa mony fald,                           15
  The hundreth part tharof I leif ontald.
  The last sax bukis of Virgill all inferis,
  Quhilk contenys strang batalis and werys,
  This ilk Caxtoun so blaitly lattis ourslip,
  I hald my tung for schame, bytand my lyp.                           20
  The gret afferis of athir host and array,
  The armour of Eneas fresch and gay,
  The quent and curyus castis poeticall,
  Perfyte symylitudis, and exempilis all
  Quharin Virgill beris the palm of lawd,                             25
  Caxtoun, for dreid thai suld hys lippis scald,
  Durst nevir twich. Thus schortly for the namys,
  A twenty devill way fall hys wark atanys,
  Quhilk is na mair lyke Virgill, dar I lay,
  Than the nycht owle resemblis the papyngay.                         30
  Quharfor ȝou gentill redaris I besich
  Traste on na wys at this my wark be sich,
  Quhilk dyd my best, as the wyt mycht atteyn,
  Virgillis versys to follow and no thing feyn.
  Ȝhe worthy noblys redis my wark for thy,                             5
  And cast this other buke on syde far by,
  Quhilk, vndir cullour of sum strange Franch wycht,
  Sa franchly leys, oneith twa wordis gais rycht.
  I nold ȝhe trast I said this for dispyte;
  For me lyst with nane Inglis bukis flyte,                           10
  Na with na bogill nor browny to debait,
  Nowder ald gaistis nor spretis ded of lait,
  Nor na man will I lakkyn nor dispys,
  My warkis till authorys be sik wys,
  Bot twichyng Virgillis honour and reuerens,                         15
  Quha euer contrary, I mon stand at defens;
  And bot my buke be fundyn worth sik thre,
  Quhen it is red, do warp it in the see,
  Thraw it in the fyre, or rent it euery crum,
  Twichand that part lo heir is all and sum.                          20
    Syne I defend and forbiddis euery wight
  That can nocht spell thar Pater Noster rycht,
  Fortill correct or ȝit amend Virgill,
  Or the translatar blame in hys wlgar stile;
  I knaw quhat payn was to follow hym fut hait,                       25
  Albeit you think my sayng intricate.
  Traste weill, to follow a fixt sentens or mater
  Is mair practik, deficill, and far strater,
  Thocht thyne engyne beyn eleuate and hie,
  Than forto write all ways at liberte.                               30
  Gif I had nocht bene to a boundis constrenyt,
  Of my bad wyt perchance I couth haue fenyt
  In ryme a ragment twys als curyus,
  Bot nocht be twenty part so sentencyus.
  Quha is attachit ontill a staik, we se,                              5
  May go na ferthir bot wreil about that tre,
  Rycht so am I to Virgillis text ybund,
  I may nocht fle, les than my falt befund;
  For thocht I wald transcend and go besyde,
  His wark remanys, my schame I may nocht hyde;                       10
  And thus I am constrenyt, als neir I may,
  To hald hys vers and go nane other way,
  Les sum history, subtell word, or the ryme
  Causith me mak digressioun sum tyme.
  So thocht in my translatioun eloquens skant is,                     15
  Na lusty cast of oratry Virgill wantis;
  My studyus brayn to comprehend his sentens
  Leit me nevir taist hys flude of eloquens;
  And thus forsuyth becaus I was nocht fre,
  My werk is mair obscur and gros per de,                             20
  Quharof, God wait, Virgill has na wyte,
  Thocht myne be blunt, hys text is maist perfyte.
  And ȝit persave I weill, be my consait,
  The kyng of poetis ganys nocht for rurall estait,
  Nor hys fresch memor for bowbardis; he or scho                      25
  Quha takis me nocht go quhar thai haue ado:
  The sonnys lycht is neuer the wers, traiste me,
  All thocht the bak hys brycht bemys doith fle.
  Greyn gentill ingynys, and breistis curageus,
  Sik ar the pepill at ganys best for ws;                             30
  Our werk desiris na lewyt rebalddaill,
  Full of nobilite is thistory all haill,
  For, euery vertu belangand a nobill man,
  This ornate poet, bettir than ony can,
  Payntand discryvis in person of Eneas;                               5
  Not forto say, sikane Eneas was,
  Ȝit than by hym perfytly blasons he
  All wirschip, manhed, and nobilite,
  With euery bonte belangand a gentill wycht,
  Ane prynce, ane conquerour, or a valȝeand knycht;                   10
  In luffis cuyr eneuch heir sall ȝhe fynd;
  And schortly, Virgill left na thing behynd
  That mycht hys volume illummyn or crafty mak;
  Reid quha hym knawys, I dar this vndertak,
  Als oft as ȝe hym reid, full weill I wait,                          15
  Ȝhe fynd ilke tyme sum mery new consait.
    Thoght venerabill Chauser, principal poet but peir,
  Hevynly trumpat, orlege, and reguler,
  In eloquens balmy, cundyt, and dyall,
  Mylky fontane, cleir strand, and roys ryall,                        20
  Of fresch endyte, throu Albion island braid,
  In hys legend of notabill Ladeis, said
  That he couth follow word by word Virgill,
  Wisar than I may faill in lakar stile;
  Sum tyme the text mon haue ane expositioun,                         25
  Sum tyme the cullour will caus a litill additioun,
  And sum tyme of a word I mon mak thre,
  In witnes of this term _oppetere_;
  Eik, weill I wait, syndry expositouris seir
  Makis on a text sentens diuers to heir,                             30
  As thame apperis, according thar entent,
  And for thar part schawis ressonys euident.
  All this is ganand, I will weill it swa be;
  Bot a sentens to follow may suffice me:
  Sum tyme I follow the text als neir I may,                           5
  Sum tyme I am constrenyt ane other way.
  Besyde Latyn our langage is imperfite,
  Quhilk in sum part is the caus and the wyte
  Quhy that of Virgillis vers the ornate bewte
  Intill our tung may nocht obseruyt be;                              10
  For thar be Latyn wordis, mony ane,
  That in our leyd ganand translatioun has nane,
  Les than we mynys thar sentens and grauyte,
  And ȝit scant weill exponyt; quha trewis nocht me
  Let thame interprit _animal_ and _homo_,                            15
  With many hundreth other termys mo,
  Quhilkis in our langage suythly, as I weyn,
  Few men can tell me cleirly quhat thai meyn;
  Betweyn _genus_, _sexus_, and _species_
  Diuersite in our leid to seik I ces;                                20
  For _obiectum_ and _subiectum_ alsswa
  He war expert couth fynd me termys twa,
  Quhilkis ar als ryfe amangis clerkis in scuyll
  As evir fowlis plungit in laik or puyll.
  Logicianys knawys heirin myne entent,                               25
  Vndir quhais boundis lurkis mony strange went,
  Quharof the proces, as now, we mon lat be.
  Bot ȝit twychyng our tungis penuryte,
  I meyn into compar of fair Latyn,
  That knawyn is maste perfite langage fyne,                          30
  I mycht also, percace, cum lyddir speid
  For _arbor_ and _lignum_ intill our leid
  To fynd different proper termys twane,
  And tharto put circumlocutioun nane;
  Rycht so, by about spech oftyn tymys                                 5
  And semabill wordis we compile our rymys.
  God wait, in Virgill ar termys mony a hundir
  Fortill expone maid me a felloun blundir;
  To follow alanerly Virgilis wordis, I weyn,
  Thar suld few vndirstand me quhat thai meyn;                        10
  The bewte of his ornate eloquens
  May nocht al tyme be kepit with the sentens.
  Sanct Gregor eik forbyddis ws to translait
  Word eftir word, bot sentens follow al gait.
  Quha haldis, quod he, of wordis the properteis                      15
  Full oft the verite of the sentens fleys.
  And to the sammyn purpos we may apply
  Horatius in hys art of poetry;
  Pres nocht, says he, thou traste interpreter,
  Word eftir word to translait thi mater.                             20
  Lo he reprevis, and haldis myssemyng,
  Ay word by word to reduce ony thing.
  I say nocht this of Chauser for offens,
  But till excus my lewyt insufficiens;
  For as he standis beneth Virgill in gre,                            25
  Vndir hym alsfer I grant my self to be.
  And netheles into sum place, quha kend it,
  My mastir Chauser gretly Virgill offendit.
  All thoch I be to bald hym to repreif,
  He was fer baldar, certis, by hys leif,                             30
  Sayand he followit Virgillis lantern toforn,
  Quhou Eneas to Dydo was forsworn.
  Was he forsworn? Than Eneas was fals;
  That he admittis, and callys hym traytour als.
  Thus, wenyng, allane Ene to haue reprevit,                           5
  He has gretly the prynce of poetis grevit.
  For, as said is, Virgill dyd diligens,
  But spot of cryme, reproch, or ony offens,
  Eneas for to loif and magnyfy;
  And gif he grantis hym maynsworn fowlely,                           10
  Than all hys cuyr and crafty engyne gais quyte,
  Hys twelf ȝheris laubouris war nocht worth a myte.
  Certis, Virgill schawys Ene dyd na thing,
  From Dydo of Cartage at hys departyng,
  Bot quhilk the goddis commandit hym beforn;                         15
  And gif that thar command maid hym maynsworn,
  That war repreif to thar diuinyte,
  And na reproch onto the said Enee.
  Als in the first, quhar Ilioneus
  Spekis to the queyn Dido, says he nocht thus,                       20
  Thar curs by fait was set tyll Italy?
  Thus mycht scho not pretend na just caus quhy,
  Thocht Troianys eftir departis of Cartage,
  Sen thai befor declaryt hir thar vayage.
  Reid the ferd buke quhar queyn Dido is wraith,                      25
  Thar sal ȝhe fynd Ene maid nevir aith,
  Promyt, nor band with hir fortill abyde:
  Thus hym tobe maynsworn may nevir betyde,
  Nor nane onkyndnes schew forto depart
  At the bydding of Jove with reuthfull hart,                         30
  Sen the command of God obey suld all,
  And vndir his charge na wrangwys deid may fall.
    Bot sikkyrly, of resson, me behufis
  Excus Chauser fra all maner repruffis,
  In lovyng of thir ladeis lylly quhyte                                5
  He set on Virgill and Eneas this wyte;
  For he was evir, God wait, all womanis frend.
  I say na mair, bot, gentil redaris heynd,
  Lat all my faltis with this offens pas by.
  Thou prynce of poetis, I the mercy cry,                             10
  I meyn thou kyng of kyngis, lord etern,
  Thou be my muse, my gydar, and laid stern,
  Remittyng my trespas and euery mys
  Throu prayer of thy moder queyn of blys!
  Afald godhed, ay lestyng, but discrepans,                           15
  In personys thre, equale of a substans,
  On the I call and Mary Virgyn myld;
  Calliope nor payan goddis wild
  May do to me na thing bot harm, I weyn,
  In Criste is all my traste and hevynnys queyn.                      20
  Thou virgyn moder and madyn be my muse,
  That nevir ȝit na synfull lyst refus
  Quhilk the besocht deuotly for supple;
  Albeit my sang to thy hie maieste
  Accordis nocht, ȝit condiscend to my write,                         25
  For the sweit liquor of thy pappis quhite
  Fosterit that prynce, that hevynly Orpheus,
  Grond of all gude, our Saluyour Ihesus.
  Bot forthirmor, and lawar to discend,
  Forgeif me Virgill gif I the offend,                                30
  Pardon thy Scolar, suffir hym to ryme,
  Sen thou was bot ane mortal man sum tyme;
  In cace I faill haue me not at disdenȝe,
  Thocht I be lewit, my leill hart can nocht fenȝe:
  I sall the follow, suld I therfor haue blame,                        5
  Quha can do bettir, sa furth in Goddis name.
  I schrynk nocht anys correkkit for tobe
  With ony wight grundit on cherite,
  And glaidly wald I baith inquire and leir,
  And till ilke cunnand wight la to my myne eyr;                      10
  Bot laith me war, but owther offens or cryme,
  Ane brimell body suld intertrike my ryme.
  Thocht sum wald swer that I the text haue vareit,
  Or that I haue this volume quyte myscareit,
  Or threpe playnly that I come nevir neir hand it,                   15
  Or at the wark is wers than evir I fand it,
  Or ȝit argue Virgill stude weill befor,
  As now war tyme to schift the werst our scor;
  Ellis haue I said, thar may be na compar
  Betwix his versis and my stile wlgar.                               20
  All thocht he stant in Latyn maist perfyte,
  Ȝit stude he nevir weill in our tung endyte,
  Les than it be by me now at this tyme.
  Gyf I haue falȝeit, baldly reprufe my ryme;
  Bot first, I pray ȝou, grape the mater cleyn,                       25
  Reproche me nocht quhill the wark be ourseyn.
  Beis not our studyus to spy a moyt in myne E,
  That in ȝour awyn a ferry boyt can nocht se,
  And do to me as ȝhe wald be done to.
  Now hark schirris, thar is na mair ado;                             30
  Quha list attend, gevis audiens, and draw neir,
  Me thocht Virgill begouth on this maner:

    I the ilk vmquhile that in the small ait reid
  Tonyt my sang; syne fra the woddis ȝeid,
  And feildis about taucht tobe obesand,                               5
  Thocht he war gredy, to the bissy husband,
  Ane thankfull wark maid for the plewchmanis art:
  Bot now the horribill stern dedys of Mart,
  The batalys and the man I will discryve.

CAP. I.

  _The Poet first proponyng hys entent
  Declaris Junois wreth and mailtalent._


  The batalis and the man I wil discrive,
  Fra Troys boundis first that fugitive
  By fait to Ytail come and cost Lavyne;
  Our land and sey kachit with mekil pyne,
  By fors of goddis abufe, from euery steid,                           5
  Of cruell Juno throu ald remembrit fede.
  Gret pane in batail sufferit he alsso,
  Or he his goddis brocht in Latio,
  And belt the cite, fra quham, of nobill fame,
  The Latyne pepill takyn heth thar name,                             10
  And eik the faderis, princis of Alba,
  Cam, and the wallaris of gret Rome alswa.
    O thou my muse, declare the causis quhy,
  Quhat maiestie offendit, schaw quham by,
  Or ȝit quharfor of Goddis the drery Queyn                           15
  Sa feil dangeris, sik travell maid susteyn
  A worthy man, fulfillit of piete:
  Is thare sik greif in hevynly myndis on hie?
    Thare was ane ancyant cite, hecht Cartage,
  Quham hynys of Tyre held intill heritage,
  Ennymy to Itail, standand fair and plane                             5
  The mouth of lang Tibir our forgane,
  Myghty of moblys, full of sculys seyr,
  And maist expert in crafty fait of weir:
  Of quhilk a land Juno, as it is said,
  As to hir special abuf al otheris maid;                             10
  Hir native land for it postponyt sche
  Callit Samo; in Cartage sett hir see;
  Thar war hir armys, and here stude eik hir chair.
  This Goddes ettillit, gif werdis war nocht contrar,
  This realme to be superior and mastres                              15
  To all landis; bot certis, netheles,
  The fatale sisteris reuolue and schaw, scho kend,
  Of Troiane blude a pepill suld discend,
  Wailliant in weir, to ryng wydquhar, and syne
  Cartage suld bryng ontill finale rewyne,                            20
  And clene distroy the realme of Lybia.
  This dredand Juno, and forthirmor alswa
  Remembring on the ancyant mortell weir
  That for the Grekis, to hir leif and deir,
  At Troy lang tyme scho led befor that day;                          25
  For ȝit the causys of wreth war nocht away,
  Nor cruell harm forȝet ne out of mynd;
  Ful deip engravyn in hir breist onkynd
  The jugement of Parys, quhou that he
  Preferrit Venus, dispisyng hir bewte;                               30
  Als, Troiane blude till hir was odyus,
  For Jupiter engendrit Dardanus,
  Fra quham the Troianys cam in adultry,
  And Ganymedes revist abuf the sky,
  Maid him his butler, quhilk was hir douchteris office.               5
  Juno inflambit, musyng on thir casis nyce,
  The quhile our sey that salit the Troianys,
  Quhilkis had the ded eschapit, and remanys
  Onslane of Grekis or of the fers Achill,
  Scho thame fordryvis, and causys oft ga will                        10
  Frawart Latium, quhilk now is Italy,
  By fremmyt werd ful mony ȝeris tharby,
  Cachit and blaw wydquhar all seys about.
  Lo quhou gret cure, quhat travell, pane, and dowt,
  Was to begyn the worthy Romanys blude!                              15
    And as the Troianys frakkis our the flude,
  Skars from the sycht of Sysilly the land,
  With bent sail full, rycht merely saland,
  Thar stevynnys scowrand fast throu the salt fame,
  Quhen that Juno, till hir euerlestand schame,                       20
  The etern wound hyd in hir breist ay greyn,
  Ontill hir self thus spak in propir teyn;
  Is this ganand, that I my purpos faill
  As clene ourcum, and may nocht from Itaill
  Withhald thys kyng of Troy and his navy?                            25
  Am I abandonyt with sa hard destany,
  Sen Pallas mocht on Grekis tak sik wraik,
  To byrn thar schippis, and all, for anys saik,
  Drowne in the sey, for Aiax Oilus wrang?
  From Jupiter the wild fyre down sche slang                          30
  Furth of the clowdis, distroyt thar schippis all,
  Ourquhelmyte the sey with mony wyndy wall;
  Aiax breist persit, gaspand furth flawmand smoke,
  Sche with a thud stikkit on a scharp roke.
  Bot I, the quhilk am clepit of godis queyn,                          5
  And onto Jove baith spous and sistir scheyn,
  With a pepill sa feill ȝheris weir sall lede;
  Quha sal from thens adorn in ony stede
  The power of Juno, or altaris sacryfy,
  Gif I ourcummyn be thus schamefully?                                10




CAP. II.

  _Quhou Dame Juno tyll Eolus’ cuntre went,
  And of the storm on the Troianys furth sent._


  And on this wys, wyth hart byrnyng as fyre,
  Musyng alone, full of malyce and ire,
  Tyll Eolus’ cuntre, that wyndy regioune,
  A brudy land of furyus stormy sowne,
  This Goddes went, quhar Eolus the kyng,                             15
  In gowsty cavys, the wyndis lowde quhissilling,
  And braithly tempestis by hys power refrenys,
  In bandis hard schet in presoun constrenys;
  And thai, heirat havand full gret disdeyn,
  Quhill all the hill resoundis, quhryne and plene                    20
  About thar closouris brayng with mony a rare.
  Kyng Eolus set hie apon his chare,
  With ceptour in hand, thar muyd to meys and still,
  Temperis thar ire, les thai suld at thar will

  Thus the hie fader almychty in cavis dyrk                            5

  And, at command also, mycht quhen he wald                           10
  Lat thame go fre at large to blaw out braid.
  To quham as than lawly thus Juno said;

  Salis the sey Tuscane, cariand to Italy
  Thar venquyst hamehald goddis and Ilion;                            15
  Bot, sen the fader of goddis euery one
  And kyng of men gave the power, quod sche,
  To meys the flude, or rays with stormys hie,

  Or skattir widquhar into cuntreis seir,                             20
  Warp all thar bodeis in the deip bedeyn.

  With the for to remane for euermar;
  Quhilk propir spous and eik thi lady myld
  Sal mak the fader to mony fair child.
    Eolus answeris, O thou my lady queyn,
  Quhat thou desiris to the it doith perteyn                          30
  Forto devys, and me behuffis thi command
  Obey; for thou the ceptour gevis me in hand
  Of all this realme, quhat so it be, and oft

  Causis me feist amang the goddis at rest,                            5
  And makis me master of wyndis and tempest.
  Be this was said, a grondyn dart leit he glide,
  And persit the bos hill at the braid syde;
  Furth at the ilke port wyndis brade in a rout,
  And with a quhirl blew all the erth about.                          10
  Thai ombeset the seys bustuusly,
  Quhil fra the deip, til euery cost fast by,

  The skyis oft lychtnyt with fyry levin,
  And schortly bath ayr, sey, and hevin,
  And euery thing mannasit the men to de,                             25

  Belive Eneas membris schuk for cald,
  And murnand baith his handis vp did hald
  Towart the sternys, with petuus voce thus gan say;
  O sevin tymys quhou happy and blissit war thai,
  Vnder hie wallis of Troy, by dynt of swerd,                          5

  O thou of Grekis maist forcy Diomed,
  Quhy mycht I not on feldis of Troy haue deit,
  And by thi rycht hand ȝaldin furth my sprete?
  Quhar that the valiant Hectour losit the swete                      10
  On Achillis speir, and grisly Sarpedon,
  And ondyr the flude Symois mony one
  With schelde and helm stalwart bodeis lyis warpit.
  And al invane thus quhil Eneas carpit,
  A blastrand bub, out from the north brayng,                         15
  Gan our the forschip in the bak saill dyng,
  And to the sternys vp the flude gan cast;
  The aris hechis, and the takillis brast;
  The schippis stevin frawart hyr went gan wryth,
  And turnyt hir braid syde to the wallis swyth.                      20
  Heich as a hill the jaw of watir brak,
  And in ane hepe cam on thame with a swak.
  Sum hesit hoverand on the wallis hycht,
  And sum the swowchand sey so law gart lycht,

  The stour vp bullyrrit sand as it war wode.
  The sowth wynd Nothus thre schippis draif away

  Amyd the sey, Italianys altaris callis;                              5
  And othir thre Eurus from the deip wallis
  Cachit amang the schald bankis of sand:
  Dolorus to se thame chop on grond, and stand
  Lyke as a wall with sand warpit about!
  Ane othir, in quham salit the Lycianys stowt,                       10
  Quhilum fallowis to kyng Pandor in weir,

  Smate furth the skippar clepit Lewcaspis,                           15
  His hed doune warpit; and the schip with this
  Thrys thar the flude quhirlit about round,
  The sowkand swelth sank vnder sey and drond.
  On the huge deip quhoyn salaris dyd appeir;
  The Troianys’ armour, tabillis, and othir geir                      20
  Flet on the wallis: and the strang barge tho

  And scho quharin ancyant Alethes was,
  The storm ourset, raif rovis and syde semys;                        25
  They all lekkit, the salt watir stremys
  Fast bullerand in at euery ryft and boyr.
  In the meyn quhile, with mony rowt and royr
  The sey thus trublit, and this tempest furth sent

  Lukand about, behaldis, the sey our all,

  And at the cost of Lyby arryvit he.
  Ane havyn place with a lang hals or entre
  Thar is, with ane ile enveronyt on athir part,
  To brek the wallis and storm of euery art;
  Within, the watir in a bosum gays.                                   5

  For hycht that semys pyngill with hevin; and vndir.

  Of all his navy thidder Eneas brocht
  Bot sevin schippis. With gret desyre and thocht
  Tobe on grund Troianys sped thame to land,
  As thai desyrit set softly on the sand;
  Thare lethis and lymmys in salt watir bedyit,                       25
  Strekit on the cost, spred furth, bekit and dryit.
  Bot first Achates slew fyre of the flynt

  Syne stikkis dry to kyndil thar about laid is,
  Quhil al in flambe the bles of fyre vp bradis.                      30
  Than was the quhete with fludis chaffit and wet,
  And instrumentis to purge it, swith out set.
  For skant of vittal, the cornys in quernys of stane

  In the meyn quhile, Eneas the bank on hie                            5

  On the greyn gers sat doune, and fillit thaim syne

  Quhen hungir thus with metis was chasit away,
  And dischis drawin, than, with lang sermond, thai

  Regratis oft the hard fortoune and cace                             10
  Of stern Orontes new drownyt in the sey,
  And now Amycus harm complenys he,
  Now hym alone the cruel fate of Lycus,
  Now strang Gyan, now stalwart Cloanthus.

  Gone was the day, and all thar lang sermoun,                        15

  The cays of arrowis tachit by hir syde,

  Of men and land onknaw we ar drive will

  And mony fair sacrifice and offerand

  Sik honour certis, quhilk feris me nocht to haue;
  Forto the madynnys of Tyre this is the gyis,
  To beir a cays of arowis on this wys,
  With rede botynys on thar schankis hie.
  This is the realm of Punyce quhilk ȝe se,                           10

  Hydder, for hir brodir, fled from the realm of Tyre:
  Lang war the iniuris, the dowtis lang tobe tald,
  Bot I the vmaste of the mater sall hald.
  Ane husband, quhilk Sycheus hecht, had sche,
  Rychast in all the ground of Phenyce,                               20
  And strangly luffit of the silly Dido;
  For be hir fader, as was the maner tho,
  By chans scho was in cleyn virginite

  In heretage held Pigmalyon hir brodir,                              25
  In wikkitnes cruel abufe all othir,
  Quhilk, but offence or occasioun of greif,
  For blynd cwatyce of gold throu his myscheif.
  Befor the altar, slely with a knyfe,
  Or he was war, reft Sycheus the lyfe;                               30
  And, of the gret luf of hys systir suyr,
  Concelyt this cruel deid lang vndir cuyr;
  That fals man, by dissaitfull wordis fair,
  With vaynhope trumpit the wofull luffar.
  Bot of hir husband bygravit the ymage                                5
  To hir apperis in sleip, with pail vissage,

  And all the hyd cryme of hir hows manyfest:                         10
  Syne in gret haist exortis hir to fle,
  And leif hir native land, and tak the see;
  And, forto help hir onwart by the way,
  Vnder the erth quhar ald hurdis hyd lay,
  Of siluer and gold revelit a huge weght.                            15
  Dido heirat commovit, I ȝou hecht,
  For hir departing falloschip reddy maid;

  The schippis that on cays war reddy thar

  The tresour of the wrachit Pigmaleon
  Is thus caryit our the sey onone:
  A woman captane is of all this deid.                                25
  To ȝone place ar thai cummyn, thou may tak heid,

  And now by fortoune to cost of Lybia

  Of all our floyt, from wynd and wallys, skant

CAP. VII.

  _Eneas, at his moderys commandment,
  Cled with the mysty clowd, to Cartage went._


  Thai, in the meyn tyme, hastit furth thar way
  As the rod led thame, quhil ascend ar thai                          20
  The hill fer rysand abuf the town on hycht,
  Quhar all the Cite forgane thame se thai mycht.
  Eneas wondrit the gretnes of Cartage,
  Quhilk lait tofor had beyn ane smal cotage;
  The fair portis alsso he ferleit fast,
  And of the brute of pepill tharat inpast,
  The large stretys paithit by and by,                                 5
  The byssy Tyrryanys lauborand ardently.
  Ane part haistis to beild the wallys wight;
  And sum to rays the gret castell on hyght,
  And welt vp stanys to the wark on hie;
  Sum grathis fast the thak and rufe of tre;                          10
  And sum about delvys the fowsy deip;
  Sum chesis officeris the lawys forto kepe,
  With counsalouris and senatouris, wys folkis;
  Ȝonder other sum the new havyn holkis;
  And heir alsso, ane other end fast by,                              15
  Lays the fundament of the theatry;
  And otheris eik the huge pillaris grete
  Out of the querrellys gan do hew and bete,
  Fortill adorn that place in all degre,
  In tyme cummyng quhar gret triumphe suldbe.                         20
  Lyke to the beys, in feildis floryst new,
  Gaderyng thar wark of mony diuers hew,
  In soft somyr the brycht son hait schynyng,
  Quhen of thar kynd thame list swarmys furth bryng,
  Or in camys inclus thar hwny cleyn,                                 25
  And with sweit liquour stuffis thar cellis scheyn,
  Or ressavys the byrdyngis from othir tharowt,
  Or fra thar hyve togyddir in a rowt
  Expellis the bowbart beist, the faynt drone be:
  Thar labour is bissy and fervent forto se,                          30
  The hwny smellys of the sweit tyme seid.
  O, quod Ene, full happy ar ȝhe in deid,
  Quhais large wallis rysys thus on hie!
  A quhile he visseit the boundis of this cite,
  Ane wonder thyng, coverit with a clowd about;                        5
  He entrys syne amyd the thikast rowt,
  Amang the men he thrang, and nane hym saw.
    Amyd the cite stude ane semly schaw,
  With hys maist plesand sobir schaddowis, quhar,
  As the Punycianys first vpwarpit war,                               10
  Efter the stormys blastis and seys rage,
  Thai, delvand, fand the takynar of Cartage,
  Ane mekill hors hed that was, I weyn,
  As Juno had schaw tofor, of goddis queyn,
  That signyfyit the cite excellent in batale,                        15
  And plentuus eik al tymys of vittale.
  In the ilke place, the Sydonas Dido
  Begouth to byg a prowd tempill of Juno,
  With dowreis seir and gyftis of ryches,
  And eik the goldyn statw of the goddes.                             20

  With bras alsso the cupplys festynyt was;
  The brassyn durris jargis on the marbill hirst.
  In this tempill, seir novelteis first
  Schawin till Eneas mesyt gretly hys feir;                           25
  The first assurance of comfort was heir,
  And hope of releif eftir aduersite:
  For as he went diuers thingis to se,
  Rowmyng about the large tempill scheyn,
  Forto behald the cummyng of the queyn,                              30
  And of the cite the gret prosperite,
  The mony warkmen, and thar craftis sle
  In dew proportioun, as he woundrit for joy,
  He saw per ordour all the sege of Troy,
  The famus batellis, wlgat throu the warld or this,                   5
  Of kyng Pryam and athir Attrides,
  And, baldar than thame baith, the fers Achill.
  He styntis, and wepand said Achates tyll;
  Quhou now, quhilk place is this, my frend, quod he,
  Quhat regioun in erd may fundyn be                                  10
  Quhar our mysforton is nocht fully proclame?
  Allace! behald, se ȝondir king Priam,
  Lo, heir his wirschip is haldin in memor;
  Thir lamentabyll takynnys passit befor
  Our mortal myndis aucht to compassioun steir.                       15
  Away with dreid, and tak na langar feir;
  Quhat! wenys thou na this fame sall do the gude?
  Thus said he, and fed hys mynd, quhar he stude,
  With thir plesand fenȝeit ymagery,
  Murnand sair, and wepand tendyrly,                                  20
  The flude of terys halyng our hys face;
  For as he lukit on the wark percace,
  He saw porturate quhar, in sik a place,
  The Grekis fled and Troianys followis the chace
  Abowt the wallys of Troy as thai dyd fyght:                         25
  At ȝondir part the Troianys tak the flycht,
  With creste on hed Achillis in hys chair
  Persewand strangly. Not far thens saw he, quhar,
  The quhite tentis of kyng Rhesus, evill kepe,
  Betraisit war apon the first sleip;                                 30
  Quhar, with gret slauchter bludy Diomeid
  Distroyt all, and till hys tent gan leid
  The mylk quhite horssis, fers, swift and gude,
  Or evir thai taistit ony Troiane fude,
  Or drunkyn had of the flude Exanthus.                                5
  And ȝondir, lo! beheld he Troilus
  Wantyng his armour, the fey barn fleand,
  Fortill recontyr Achilles onganand,
  The hors hym harland behynd the void cart
  Hyngand wyde oppyn, and hys hed dounwart;                           10
  Suppos he held the renȝeis fast, but faill,
  Hys nek and harys on the erd gan traill,
  The speir ourturnyt in the duste dyd write.
  The sammyn tyme, the Troian madynys quhite,
  With hair doun skalit, all sorofull gan pas                         15
  Onto the tempill of the grevit Pallas
  To ask supple, with thame a wympill bair thai,
  With handis betand thar breistis by the way:
  This fremmyt goddes held hir eyn fixt fast
  Apon the grund, nocht a blenk list thame cast.                      20
  Abowt the wallis of Troy he saw quhat wys
  Achilles harlyt Hectoris body thrys;
  The ded corps syne for gold he saw hym sell.
  Law from his breist murnand he gave a ȝell,
  Seand the void cart, and spulȝe of the knycht,                      25
  And the corps of his derrest frend sa dight.
  Priam onarmyt streke furth handis dyd he spy
  From Achilles hys sonnys body to by.
  Hym self alsswa, mydlit, persavit he,
  Amang princis of Grece in the melle.                                30
  The orient hostis knew he one by one,
  And Vlcanus armour on blak Memnon.
  The madynnys cum fra Amason saw he soyn,
  With crukit scheildis schapyn like the moyn,
  Led by thar furyus queyn Pantissylle;                                5
  Amyd the thowsandis egyrly feghtis sche,
  And quhar hir pap was for the speir cut away,
  Of gold tharon was belt a rych tyschay:
  Ane worthy weriour suythly thai mycht hir ken,

  _Quhou Eneas with all his rowt bedene
  War thankfully ressauyt of the queyn_.


  With thir wordis the spreit of Eneas
  And of the strang Achates reiosyt was,
  Gretly desyryng the clowd to brek in tway:
  Bot first Achates till Enee gan say;                                20
  Son of the goddes, quhat purpos now, quod he,

  And scarsly haith he all thir wordis spokkyn,                        5
  Quhen that the clowd abowt thame swith was brokkyn,
  And vanyst tyte away amang the ayr.
  Vp stude Enee, in cleir lycht schynyng fair,
  Lyke till ane god in body and in face;
  For his moder grantit hir son sik grace;                            10
  Hys crysp harys war plesand on to se,
  Hys favour gudly, full of fresch bewte,
  Lyke till ane ȝongker with twa lauchand eyn;
  Als gracyus for to behold, I weyn,

  Quhen thai beyn circulit about with gold sa fyne.
  Or evir thai wist, befor tham all in hy,
  Onto the queyn thus said he reuerently;                             20
  Hym quham ȝe seik behald now present heir,
  Enee the Troian, delyverit from danger
  Of storm and wallys of the Libiane see.
  O thou only, quhilk rewth hes and piete
  On the ontellabill pyne of the Troianys,                            25
  Quhilk ws, the Grekis levyngis and remanys,

  And to famyliar frendschip and ally;                                30
  To quyte the, rendring ganand thankis rycht,
  That lyis nocht, Dido, intill our mycht,
  Nor all the laif of the Troian menȝe,
  Throw out this warld skatterit quhar euer thai be:

  To thame at petuus beyn and pacient,
  For justice eik gif euer reward beis get,
  And rychtwys myndis ramembrit and nocht forȝet.
  Thai ilke goddis mot dewly reward the

  Quhou happy and joyus was that tyme serene
  That the producit hes, sa nobill a queyn!

  Quhill fludis rynnys in the sey but dowt,                           15
  Quhil sonnys schaddow circlys hillis about,
  And the firmament starris doith conteyn,

  And thy renown remane perpetualy,
  Throu all realmys quharto that drevyn am I.                         20
  Thus sayand, til his frend Ilioneus
  Hys rycht hand gave he, and to Serestus
  Gave his left hand; syne welcumit euery man,
  The strang Cloanthus and the stowt Gyan.
    The queyn Dido, astonyst a litill wie                             25
  At the first syght, behaldand his bewte,

  Onto him thus scho said with myld face;
  Son of the goddes, quhat hard aduersite

  Quhat fors and violens drave the hyddir till ws,
  Apon thir costis that beyn so dangerus?
  Art thou not theilk compacient Eneas,
  That apon haly Venus engendrit was
  Be the Troian Anchises, as thai say,                                 5
  Besyde the flude Symois in Phrigia?
  Weill I remembir, to Sydon the cyte
  Sen Tewcer com, banyst from his cuntre,
  Sekand supple at Belus, and sum new land.
  My fader than, Belus, I vndirstand,                                 10
  The rich realm of Cipir wastit by weir,
  And wan it syne, and gave it to Tewcer;
  And evir syne of Troy, that gret cyte,
  The distructioun has beyn weill knaw to me,
  Thy name alsso, and pryncis of Grece sans faill,                    15
  With quham thou faught seir tymys in batale.
  This ilke Tewcer hys ennemys of Troy
  Rusyt and lovit, and with excellent joy
  Full oft him self extoll and vant he wald
  Of Troiane blude tobe discend of ald.                               20
  Tharfor haue done, gallandis, cum on ȝour way,
  Entir within our lugyng, we ȝou pray:
  Siclike fortoun, throu mony feill danger,
  At last onto this land has dryve me heir;
  Thus, nocht mysknawand quhat payn is ennoy to dre,                  25
  I lernyt to help all tholis aduersyte.
  Rehersyng this, convoys sche Eneas
  Towart the place quhar hir ryche palyce was,
  And tharwith eik commandis halyday,
  Throwe owt the cyte all suldbe game and play.                       30
  And netheles, the sammyn tyme, sendis sche
  Down to his folkis, at the cost of the see,
  Twenty fed oxin, large, gret and fyne,
  And ane hundreth bustuus bowkis of swyne,
  Ane hundreth lammys and thar moderis tharby,                         5
  With other presandis, and wyne habundandly.
  The place within maist gloriusly and gay
  Adornyt was all our with ryall array:
  Amyd the hie rufe of the mekill hall,
  For the banket, mony rich claith of pall                            10
  Was spred, and mony badkyn wonderly wrocht;
  Of siluer playt ane huge weght furth was brocht
  To set on burdis; and veschell forgit of gold,
  Quharin was grave, maste curyus to behold,
  The valȝeant dedis of forfaderis past by,                           15

  In haist Achates to the schippis send,
  To schaw Ascaneus all fra end till end,
  Onto the cite that he onon war brocht;
  On ȝong Ascaneus was haill the faderis thocht.

  To do his charge, Achates bissely
  The way towart the schippis socht in hy.

  Of cruell Juno the dreid brynt hir inwart,
  With mony thocht ran hastely tyll hir hart.

  For thy scho spak, and said on this maner;

  O thou my son, quhilk only art so wight
  That thou the dartis of Jupiter dar ganestand,
  Quharwith he slew Typhon, the fell gyand,
  To the I cum, to the I seik, quod sche,

  This beand said, the cowpe with the rich wyne

CAP. I.

  _Quhou the Grekis withdrew thame of the raid,
  And of the mekill subtile hors thai maid._


  The Grekis chiftanys, irkit of the weir
  Bypast or than sa mony langsum ȝeir,
  And oft rebutyt by fatale destany,
  Ane huge hors, lyke ane gret hil, in hy
  Craftely thai wrocht in wirschip of Pallas;                          5
  Of sawyn beche the ribbis forgyt was;
  Fenȝeand ane oblacioune, as it had be
  For prosper returnyng hame in thair cuntre:
  The voce this wys throu owt the cite woyk.
  Of choys men syne, walit by cut, thai tuke                          10
  A gret numbyr, and hyd in bylgis dern
  Within that best, in mony huge cavern;
  Schortly, the belly was stuffit euery deill
  Ful of knychtis armyt in plait of steill.
    Thair standis into the sycht of Troy ane ile,                     15
  Weil knawin by name, hecht Tenedos vmquhile,
  Myghty of gudis quhil Priamus ryng sa stude;
  Now is it bot a fyrth in the sey flude,
  A raid onsikkyr for schip or ballyngare.
  In desert costis of this iland thar
  The Grekis thame ful secretly withdrew;                              5
  We wenyng thame hame passit and adew,
  And, with gude wynd, of Myce the realm had socht.
  Quharfor al thai of Troy, blyth as thai mocht,
  Thair langsum duyl and murnyng dyd away,
  Kest vp the portis and yschit furth to play,                        10
  The Grekis tentis desyrus forto se,
  And voyd placis quhar thai war wont tobe,
  The cost and strandis left desert al cleyn.
  Heir stude the army of Dolopeis, sum wald meyn,
  Cruel Achil heir stentit his pailȝeon;                              15
  Quhar stude the navy, lo the place ȝonder down;
  Heir the ostis war wont to joyn in feild.
  And sum, wondring, the scaithfull gyft beheld
  Suldbe offerit to the onweddit Pallas,
  Thai mervellit fast the hors samekil was:                           20
  Bot Tymetes exortis first of all
  It forto leid and draw within the wall,
  And forto set it in the cheif palyce;
  Quhidder for dissait, I not, or for malyce,
  Or destany of Troy wald sa suldbe.                                  25
  Bot Capis than, with are othir menȝe
  Quhilk bettir avys thar myndis set apon,
  Bad cast or drown into the sey onone
  That suspek presand of the Grekis dissait,
  Or kyndill tharvndir flambe of fyris hait,                          30
  Or forto rype that holkit huge belly,
  And the hyd hyrnys to sers and weil espy.
  Quhat nedis mair? the onstabill common voce
  Diuidit was in mony seir purpos.
  Quhen thidder come befor thame al onone,                             5
  Followand a gret rowt, the prest Laocon
  From the cheif tempil rynnand in ful gret hy;
  On far, O wrachit pepil, gan he cry,
  Quhou gret wodnes is this at ȝe now meyn,
  Ȝour ennymyis away salit gif ȝe weyn,                               10
  Or gif ȝe traist ony Grekis gyftis be
  Withowt dissait, falshed and subtelte!
  Knaw ȝe na bettir the quent Vlixes slycht?
  Owder in this tre ar Grekis closit ful rycht,
  Or this engyne is byggit to our skaith,                             15
  To wach our wallis and our byggynys bath,
  Or to confound and ourquhelm our cite;
  Thar lurkis sum falshed tharin, trastis me;
  Lippyn nocht, Troianys, I pray ȝou, in this hors;
  Quhow euer it be, I dreid the Grekis fors,                          20
  And thame that sendis this gyft always I feir.
  Thus sayand, with al his strenth a gret speir
  At the syde of that bysnyng best threw he,
  And in jonyngis of the thrawyn wame of tre
  Festynnyt the lance, that trymlyng gan to schaik;                   25
  The braid belly schudderit, and with the straik
  The boys cavys sowndit and maid a dyn.
  And had nocht beyn that owder his wit was thyn,
  Or than the fatis of goddis war contrary,
  He had assayt, but ony langar tary,                                 30
  Hyd Grekis covert with irne to haue rent owt;
  Than suld thou, Troy, haue standyn ȝit, but dowt,
  And the prowd palyce of Kyng Priamus
  Suld haue remanyt ȝit ful gloryus.




CAP. II.

  _The takyng of the tresonabill Synon,
  And of hys fenȝeit wordis mony one._


  Lo, the ilk tyme, harland onto the kyng                              5
  Troiane hyrdis with gret clamour dyd bryng
  A ȝong man, baith his handis behynd his bak
  Hard bundyn, that wilfully forto be tak
  Rendrit hym self, onknawyn the caws quhy,
  Forto perform his deid mair secretly;                               10
  By stowt curage reddy to athir of tway,
  Owder to bryng hys slycht to gude assay,
  Or faillyng tharof, dowtles reddy to de

  Fast flokkis about a multitude ȝong Troianys,
  Byssy to knak and pul the presoneir.
    Now the dissait of Grekis may ȝe heir,
  And all thar falshed lern by this a slycht.
  For, alsso fast in myddis of al our sycht                           20
  As that drery onarmyt wyght was stad,
  And with eyn blent about, semyng ful rad,
  Behaldand Troiane rowtis on athir hand,
  Alace, quod he, wald God some erd, or sand,
  Or sum salt sey dyd swelly me alyve!
  Quhat other thing now restis to me catyve,
  Quhamto sal nevir amang Grekis agane                                 5
  A place be fundyn suythly to remane?
  And maratour, Troianys, offendyt eik,
  To sched my blude by paynful deth dois seik.
  With this regrait our hartis sterit to piete,
  All molestatioune cessit and lattyn be,                             10
  We hym exort rehers, and tobe bald,
  Of quhat lynnage he was, and quhat he wald,
  And to ramembir, gude hope of ferm supple
  Happynnys oft to presoneris in captiuite.
  He, at the last, this fenȝeit dreid dyd away,                       15
  And on this wys onone begouth to say;
  Forsuyth, Schir kyng, I sal, quhat euer betyde,
  Grant to the all the verite, and nocht hyde,
  Nor, be na ways, me lyst nocht to deny
  That of the Grekis menȝe ane am I.                                  20
  Thys principaly I wald thou vndyrstude;
  Thocht frawart fortoun miserabill and bayr of gude
  Has maid Synon, sche sal nocht mak hym als,
  Quhat euer he says, nowder lear nor fals.
  Gyf euer onto ȝour eris come the name,                              25
  The hie wirschip, and the renownyt fame
  Of Palamedes, from Belus blude discend,
  Quham Grekis by fals traysoun, as weil is kend,
  Throw corrupt witnes stanyt to ded, but les,
  For he the weir forbad and procurit pes;                            30
  Now murn thai for his dede; and with hym heir
  In falloschip, my puyr fader in weir
  Send me of ȝouth, as to hym neir of blude.
  Quhil in prosperite of the realm he stude,
  And Grekis ryng by counsale was rewlit wysly,                        5
  Sum name of wyrschip and autorite bair I:
  Bot efter that by envy and haitrent
  Of the fals flechand Vlixes sa quent,
  I iape not, for that I say weyll I knaw;
  Fra he was slane, allace, and brocht of daw,                        10
  Dolorus my lyfe I led in sturt and pane,
  Hevyly weyand my innocent frende thus slane.
  Ses couth I nocht, bot in my franacy,
  Gyf euer I happit my tyme forto espy,
  And victour haue returnyt onto Arge,                                15
  I hecht to be revengit: with wordis large
  Thus I prouokit scharp feid and malyce baith.
  To me this was fyrst apperans of skaith.
  From thens fordwart, Vlixes mair and mayr
  With new crymys begouth affray me sair,                             20
  And dangerus rumour amang the commonys hedis
  Skalit and sew of me in diuers stedis,
  And, knawyng hym self gylty, by hys consait
  Grathit hys wapynys of slycht and fals dissait;
  Nor cessit he neuer his purpos to persew                            25
  Quhil the solysting of Calcas I mycht rew:
  Bot quharto tell I or rehersis this,
  That be na ways displesis ȝou, I wys?
  Quhy tary I my deth? and ȝe lyst, stryke;
  Gyf that ȝe favour all the Grekis elyke,                            30
  This is enewch at ȝe haue hard of me:
  Now haist my pane, sen algatis I mon de.
  Vlixes, quhilk is kyng of Ithacy,
  Wald it war swa, and with gret price wald by
  My deth Agamemnon als, and Menalay.                                  5
  Than hastit we, and brynt to heir hym say,
  Desyrus all the maner forto heir,
  Mysknawyng the gret iniquiteis seir
  And sle craftis of Grekis in euery deid.
  He quakand than, as it had bene for dreid,                          10
  Begouth forto tell furth the remanent,
  Sayand on this wys, with ful dissemlyt entent:
  The Grekis oft in purpos war and will
  To fle from Troy and leif it standand still,
  And, wery of thar lang weir, pas away;                              15
  Wald God swa thai had done syne mony a day!
  The seys rage and storm thame stoppit oft,
  And from thar passage the north wynd onsoft
  Held thame abak, in angwys and in feir;
  And principaly now, sen this hors was heir                          20
  Of hattyr gestis beldit vp, but dowt,
  The stormy clowdis our al the ayr gan rowt.
  We, dowtyng heiron, send the preste Erypilus
  Answer to seik at the tempill of Phebus,
  And from the secret oratory, suyth to sayn,                         25
  Thir soroful tythyngis he ws brocht agane:
  With blude and by the slauchtir of a maid,
  Grekis, ȝe mesyt the wyndis first, he said,
  Quhen that ȝe come of Troy to the cuntre;
  Ȝour haym passage by blude mon fundyn be,                           30
  And haue ȝour askyn by deth of a Gregyoun.
  Quhen to the commonys eris ran the sown
  Of thir wordis, with myndis affrayit, atanys
  The cauld dreid ran in throu thar banys,
  For feir quhamto was schape this destanye,                           5
  Or quho it was Apollo desyrit to die.
  Vlixes than, amang thame, with gret dyn,
  Calcas the gret dyvynour has brocht in,
  And bissely at hym inquiris he,
  By respons of the goddis, quha suld de.                             10
  Than mony ane demyt to me, ful rycht,
  The cruel wraik of that dissaitful slycht,
  And quyetly persavit how it wald wend.
  This Calcas held his tong ten days to end,
  Kepand secret and cloys al his entent,                              15
  Refusyng with his word ony to schent,
  Or to pronunce the deth of ony wyght:
  Skars at the last, throu gret clamour and slyght
  Of Vlixes constrenyt, but mair abaid,
  As was devisit, the laith word furth braid,                         20
  And me adiudgit to send to the altare.
  Tharto alhail the Grekis assentit are,
  And sufferit glaidly so the mater pas;
  Quhar as tofor eueryane tobasyt was
  For hym selwyn, tho blyth was page and knycht                       25
  The chance returnyt on a catyfe wyght.
  Cummyn was the duylful day that doith me grys,
  Quhen that of me suld be maid sacryfyce,
  With salt meldir, as weil the gyis is kend,
  Abowt my heide a garland or a bend.                                 30
  I grant that from the deth my self I fred,
  The bandis I brast, and fast away syne fled
  Ontil a muddy marras, quhar, the dyrk nycht,
  Amang the rysp and redis out of sycht
  Full law I lurkit, quhil vp salys drew thai,                         5
  Gif thai perchance be ȝit passit away.
  Now restis thar na hope; allace, fell me!
  My natyve cuntre sal I neuer se,
  Nor deir childryng, nor fader weil belovit,
  Quham, as I traist, the Grekis, all ammovit                         10
  For myne eschaping, turment sal with pane;

  Quharfor, Schir king, be the hie goddis abufe,
  And thar mychtis that trewth best knawis and lufe,
  And by the faith onfylit, and leil lawte,                           15
  Gyf it with mortale folkis may fundyn be,
  Haue rewth and piete on sa feil harmys smart,
  And tak compassioune in thi gentill hart;

  Lo! twa gret lowpit edderis, with mony thraw,
  Fast throu the flude towart the land gan draw.
  My spreit abhorris this mater to declare;

  Onto the cheif tempil fled ar thai,
  Of stern Pallas to the hallowit place,
  And crap in vnder the feit of the goddes,

  And clerar wolx the rumour and the dyne:
  So that, suppos Anchysis my faderis In

  So bustuus grew the noys and furyus fray,
  And ratlyng of thar armour on the streit,                           15

  And dryvis on swyftly stokkis, treis and stanys:

  The lattir day is cummyn of Dardanus end,
  The fatale tyme quham na walyng may mend;

  So that sum Grekis victoris war smyte ded.
  Cruel womenting occupyit euery steid;

  And of the deth feil gastly schaddowis thair.                       10
    Bot first enconteris ws Androgeus,
  With a gret cumpany of the Gregyus,
  Onwarly wenyng his fallowis we hadbe;
  In haymly wordis to ws thus carpis he:
  Haist ȝou, matis, quhat slewth tareit ȝou thus lait?                15
  Our other feris rubbis, tursyng away, fut hait,
  The spreith of Troy, quhilk now is brynt to gledis,
  And ȝe, fyrst from ȝour schippis now ȝou spedis.
  Thus said he, quhen that, suddanly and onone,
  He felt hym self happynnyt amyd his foyn,                           20
  For we hym gave answer not traist enewch.
  Estonyt with the word, abak he drewch:
  As quha onwar tred on a rowch serpent
  Lyggyng in the bus, and for feir bakwart sprent,
  Seand hir, reddy to stang and to infek,                             25
  Set vp hir vennamus ȝallo boldyn nek;
  On the sammyn wys, Androgeus, of our syght

  Tha fey Gregionys, on ilk syde heir and thair,
  With dreid ourset, and wist not quhar thai war.
  The first lawbour thus lukkit weil with ws.
  Joyus in hart of this chance Chorebus,
  O ȝe feris, hald furth this way, quod he,                            5
  Quhar forton first has schawyn ws sik supple;

  Thai sal ws rendir thir harnes of thar bakkis.
  And sayand thus, Androgeus cristit helm

  And hang a Gregioun swerd down by his the.
  Syklyke dyd Rypheus, my self eik, and Dymas,
  And all the other ȝong men at thar was;
  Ful glaidly in that recent spulȝe warm

  Amang the Grekis mydlit than went we,
  Not with our awyn takyn nor deite;
  Mony debatis and onsettis haue we done,
  And, throu the silens of the nycht, ondone
  Feil of the Grekis, and send to hell adown.                         25
  Ane other menȝe fled fast out of town
  To thar schippis, and tha traist costis nyce;

  And hyd thame in that belly weilbeknaw.                             30
    Allace! onleifull is ony man to weyn,
  Contrar the plesour of goddis, ocht may sustene.
  Lo! Priamus dochtir, the virgyne Cassandra,
  Was, from the tempill and sete of Mynerva,

  A miserabil slauchtir thar begouth that nycht.

  And ombesettis cruelly and sayr;

  And al the rowtis clepit Dolopes.
  Lyke as, sum tyme, the fers wyndis ȝe se,                           25

  And first of all, down smyte is Chorebus
  By the rycht hand of Greik Peneleus,
  Befor the altare of armipotent Pallas:
  Rypheus down fell, ane the maist just man was,
  Amang Troianys best kepand equite;                                  15
  Bot other ways the goddis thocht suldbe:

  Nor ȝit the, Panthus, quhen that thou fell down,

  Nor habyt of Apollo hyd from skayth.
    O ȝe cald assys of Troy, and flawmys baith,
  And extreme end of cuntre folkis, heir I
  Drawis ȝow to witnes, and doys testify,
  Quhen that ȝe fell to grund thus and war slane,                     25
  I nowder sparit wapynnys, strenth, nor pane,
  Nor nane onset eschewit of Grekis mycht;
  And gif fatis wald I had fallyn in fyght,
  Thar with my handis wrocht I worth my ded.
  Bot with the pres we war relit of that sted:                        30
  Only with me Hyphitus and Pelyas;
  For age Hyphitus waik and febill was,
  And Pelyas slawly mycht onethis go,
  By Vlixes for he was woundit so.

  The prowd and ryall werkis of faderis ald.
  And other sum, law down within that hald,
  With drawyn swerdis stude reddy to kepe the ȝet;                     5
  In a thik rowt tharat was mony set.
  Our spretis war restoryt, and curage grew
  The kyngis palyce to succur, and reskew
  The men tharin with all help and supple,
  To strenthing thame war venquyst neyr, we se.                       10
    A small wykket thar was, or entre dern,
  A litil ȝet clepit a postern,
  On the bak half Priamus palyce almaist,

  Quharat was wont alane Andromocha                                   15
  To entir oft to Priam and Hecuba,
  And Astyanax, hir ȝong son, with hir bring

  Threw down dartis, thocht all was bot in waist.
  We start ontil a hie turate in haist,
  The top vpstrekand to the starnys hie,
  Quharon we wont war al Troy forto se,
  The Grekis schippis, and thar tentis eik.                           25
  With instrumentis of irne we pyke, and seik
  Round al about quhar the jonyngis war worn,
  Reddy to fall, and corbalys al to torn;
  We holk and mynd the corneris for the nanys,
  Quhil down belive we tumbil it al atanys;                           30
  A fellon rusch it maid, and sownd with all,
  And large on breid our Grekis rowtis dyd fall;
  Bot sone ane other sort start in thar stedis:
  Nowder stanys, nor quarellis with scharp hedis,
  Nor na kynd of wapynnys war sparit than.                             5
  And first of al, befor the porch inran
  Hard to the entre, in schynyng plait and mail,
  Pyrrus, with wapynnys fersly to assaill:
  Lyke to the edder, with schrewit herbis fed,
  Cummyn furth to lycht, and on the grond lyis spred,                 10
  Quham wynter lang hyd vnder the cald erd;
  Now slippit hir slowch with schynand skyn new brerd,

  Heich vp hir nek strekand forgane the son,
  With forkit tong intyll hir mouth quytterand.                       15
  To the assalt with Pyrrus come at hand
  Periphas, and Automedon his squyer
  Was wont to govarn Achilles cart in weir,
  And al the sensabill men of Scyrrya
  Bownys our the wallis and howsis hedis alswa,                       20
  And fyre blesis abuf the rufe garris fle.
  Bot first of al, ane stalwart ax hynt he,
  The stern Pyrrus, to hew and brek the ȝet,
  And furth of har the stapillis has he bet,
  And bandis all of bras yforgyt weill:                               25
  Be that in twa the master bar ilk deill
  Is al tofruschit; syne the hard burdis he hakkis,
  And throu the ȝet are large wyndo makkis,
  By the quhilk slop the place within apperis,
  The wyde hallys wolx patent al infeiris                             30
  Of Priamus and ancyant kyngis of Troy;
  Secret throwgangis ar schawyn wont to be quoy;
  Armyt men se thai stand at the first port.
  Bot than throw owt the inner palyce, at schort,
  With duylful scryke and walyng al is confoundit;                     5
  The holl howsis ȝowlit and resowndit
  For womentyng of ladeis and wemen;
  The clamour vpstrak to the starnys then.
  The woful moderis ran frayit on athir syde
  Ful lamentabill throw out the chawmeris wyde,                       10
  Brasand the postis in armys, and durris cald,
  And feil sys with mowthis kys thame wald.
  Instantly Pyrrus assailȝeis with al his mycht,
  By naturale strenth of his fader the wight,
  That nowder closeris, nor barryt ȝettis stowt,                      15
  Nor ȝit the keparis may hald thame langar owt.
  Oft wyth the ram the port is schaik and duschit,
  Down bet ȝet chekis, and bandis al tofruschit;
  The way is maid by fors, and entre brokkyn;
  Grekis insprent, the formaste haue thai stokyn                      20
  And slane with swordis; the large hald heir and thar
  Was fyllit full of Grekis our alquhar.
  Not sa fersly the fomy ryver or flude
  Brekkis our the bankis, on spait quhen it is wode,
  And, with hys brusch and fard of watir brown,                       25

  Our al the feildis that thai may row a bayt,
  Quhil howsys and the flokkis flyttis away,
  The corn grangis, and standand stakkis of hay.                      30
  I saw my self thair Neoptolemus
  Mak fellon slauchtir, wod and furyus,
  And athir brodir of Atrides alswa:
  Eldmodir to ane hundreth thar saw I Hecuba,
  And Priamus, at the altar quhar he stude,                            5
  All our bysprent and sperklyt ful of blude
  Of sacryfice, quhamto he bet the fyre.
  Fyfty chawmeris held that rial syre,
  Quhar warryn his gude dochteris, ladeis ȝyng,
  Syk fayr beleif is lost of his ofspryng!                            10

  Of barbary wark, and hungyn mony fold
  With riches and spulȝe of seyr nationys,
  Sa far as from the fyre onbet adoune is,
  The Grekis occupyis haly; al is tharis;                             15

  _Into this nixt cheptour ȝe may attend
  Of Priam Kyng of Troy the fatale end._


  Peraventur, of Priamus wald ȝe speir
  Quhou tyd the chance, hys fait gif ȝe lyst heir
  Quhen he the cite saw takyn and downbet,
  And of his palyce brokyn euery ȝet,                                 20
  Amyd the secret closettis eik hys fays,
  The auld grayth, al for nocht, to hym tays
  Hys hawbryk quhilk was lang furth of vsage,
  Set on his schulderis trymlyng than for age;
  A sword, but help, about hym beltis he,
  And ran towart hys fays, reddy to de.
  Amyd the clos, vnder the hevyn al bayr,                              5
  Stude thar that tyme a mekil fair altare,
  Neyr quham thar grew a rycht ald lawrer tre,
  Bowand towart the altare a litill wie,
  That with his schaddow the goddis did ourheld.
  Hecuba thydder, with hir childer, for beild                         10
  Ran al invane, and about the altare swarmys,
  Brasand the godlyke ymage in thar armys,
  As for the storm dowis flokkis togidder ilkane:
  Bot quhen scho saw how Priamus has tane
  His armour, so as thocht he hald beyn ȝyng;                         15
  Quhat fulych thocht, my wrachit spows and kyng,
  Movis the now syk wapynnys forto weld?
  Quhidder hastis thou? quod sche; of na sik beld
  Haue we now mystir, nor syk deffendouris as the,
  The tyme is nocht ganand tharto we se.                              20
  In cace Hector war present heir, my son,
  He mycht nocht succour Troy, for it is won:
  Quharfor, I pray the, syt doune and cum hydder,
  And lat this altare salue ws al togidder,
  Or than atanys al heir lat ws de.                                   25
  Thus said scho, and, with sik sembland as mycht be,
  Hym towart hir has brocht, but ony threte,
  And set the auld doune on the haly sete.
    Bot lo! Polytes, ane of Priamus sonnys,
  Quhilk from the slauchter of Pyrrus away run is,                    30
  Throw wapynnys fleyng and his ennemys all,
  By lang throwgangis and mony voyd hall;
  Woundit he was, and come to seik reskew;
  Ardently Pyrrus gan him fast persew,
  With grondyn lance at hand so neir furthstrekit,                     5
  Almaist the hed hym twichit and arekit.
  Quhil at the last, quhen he is cummyn, I weyn,
  Befor his faderis and his moderis eyn,
  Smate hym down ded in thar sycht, quhar he stude,
  The gaist he ȝald with habundans of blude.                          10
  Priamus than, thocht he was halfdeill ded,
  Mycht nocht conteyn his ire nor wordis of fed,
  Bot cryis furth: For that cruell offens,
  And owtragyus fuyl hardy violens,
  Gif thar be piete in the hevin abone                                15
  Quhilk takis heid to this at thou has done,
  The goddis mot condyngly the forȝeld,
  Eftir thi desert rendring sik gaynȝeld,
  Causit me behald myne awyn child slane, allace!
  And with hys blude fylit the faderis face.                          20
  Bot he, quhamby thou fenys thi self byget,
  Achil, was not to Priam sa hard set;
  For he, of rycht and faith eschamyt eik,
  Quhen that I come hym lawly to beseik,
  The ded body of Hector rendrit me,                                  25
  And me convoyit hame to my cite.
  Thus sayand, the ald waykly, but fors or dynt,
  A dart dyd cast, quhilk, with a pyk, gan stynt
  On his harnes, and in the scheild dyd hyng,
  But ony harm or other dammagyng.                                    30
  Quod Pyrrus, sen always thou saist swa,
  To Pellyus son, my fader, thou most ga:
  Beir hym this message, ramembir weil thou tell
  Him al my warkis and dedis sa cruell;
  Schaw Neoptolemus is degenerit cleyn.                                5
  Now salt thou de: and with that word, in teyn,
  The ald trymlyng toward the altare he drew,
  That in the hait blude of his son, sched new,
  Fundrit; and Pyrrus grippis hym by the hayr
  With his left hand, and with the tother al bayr                     10
  Drew furth his schynand swerd, quhilk in his syde
  Festynnyt, and onto the hyltis dyd he hyde.
    Of Priamus thus was the finale fait;
  Fortone heir endit his gloryus estait,
  Seand Ilion al byrn in fyris brown,                                 15
  And Troys wallis fall and tumlyt down;
  That ryal Prince, vmquhile, our Asya,
  Apon sa feil pepil and realmys alswa
  Ryngnyt in welth, now by the cost lyis ded,
  Bot as a stok, and of hakkit his hed;                               20
  A corps, but lyfe, renown, or other fame,
  Onknawyn of ony wight quhat was his name.

  Of Dardane eik the strandis and the flude

  Na, na, nocht swa, I wys, that sal scho nocht:
  And, set it be nocht lovabill nor semly thocht

  Na victory, bot lak followyng alswa;

  And, forto eik the myscheif of hir ded

  In sik form of quantite and estait

  Bot the wroth of the goddis has down beft
  The city of Troy from top onto the grond.
  Behald! (for I, within a litil stound,
  The clowd of dyrknes from thi sycht so cleir,
  That on ȝour mortell eyn, quhil ȝe beyn heir,                       20

  Maist cruel Juno has, or this, alsswa

  And from the schippis the ostis in scho callis,

  All occupyis, schynyng in weirlyke weid,

  And eik the goddis ire prouokis he

  Fle thou, my son, in haist away thou wend,
  And of this laubour onprofitabil mak ane end;

  Quhil to thi faderis ȝet I the convoy.
    Thus sayand, scho hir hyd in the cloys nycht.
  Than terribil figuris apperis to my sycht
  Of gret goddis, semand with Troy agrevit;
  And tho beheld I al the cite myschevit,                             20
  Fayr Ilion all fall in gledis down,
  And, fra the soyll, gret Troy, Neptunus town,
  Ourtumlyt to the grond: so as ȝhe se
  The lauboreris, into the montanys hie,
  With steil axis byssely hak and hew                                 25
  A mekil ayk that mony ȝeir thar grew;
  The tre branglis bostyng to the fall,
  With top trymlyng, and branchis schakand all;
  Quhil finaly it get the lattyr straik,
  Than, with a rair, down duschis the mekil aik,                      30
  And with his fard brekis down bewis about.
    Furth of that sted I went, and throu the rowt
  Of ennemyis and flambis I me sped;
  The fyre and wapynnys gave me place, and fled.
  So happely the goddes gydit me,                                      5
  Quhil that within the portis and entre

  Bot he reffusys or euer to leif in joy
  Eftir the rwyne and distructioun of Troy:
  To suffir exile he said that he ne couth.
  O ȝe! quod he, in blude and florist ȝouth,
  That has ȝour strenth ȝit, and ȝour forcy mycht,                    15

  It is eneuch, eneuch, and mair, I weyn,
  A distructioun of Troy that we haue seyn,                           20
  Remanyng alyve eftyr the cite tane.
  So, so, hald on, leif this ded body alane;
  Say the last quething word, adew, to me.

  To get my spulȝe; quhat of the body na cure;
  The corps is sone warpit in sepulture.

  Ay sen the fader of goddis and kyng of men
  With thunderis blast me smate, as that ȝe ken,
  And with his fyry levin me omberauch,
  That we intill our langage clepe fyreflauch.
    Rehersyng this, fermly he dyd remane                               5
  At his first purpos fixt, and we agane

  And not be wilful to perys all atanys,                              10
  And to escheif the chance as it was went:
  Plat he reffusys, anherdyng to his entent,
  The fyrst sentence haldyng euer ane.
  To start to harnes I am compeld agane,
  And, as maste wrachit and miserabil catyve,                         15

  For by na wysdome, nor chance, persave I mycht

  Quhen suddanly, a wonder thing to tell,
  A feirful takyn betyd of gret mervell.
  For lo! the top of litill Ascanyus hed,                              5

  Of his parentis, from the sched of his crown,

  Abasit, trymlyng for the dreidfull feir,

  With ony prayeris inclynyt gif thou may be,
  Tak heid to ws, and gif we haue deseruyt,
  For our piete and rewth, tobe conseruyt,                            20
  Haly fader, send ws thi help als ȝoir,
  And conferm al thir takynnys seyn befor.
    Scarsly the auld thir wordis had warpit owt,
  Quhen sone the ayr begouth to rumbill and rowt
  On our left hand, towart the north ful rycht,
  And from the hevin fell, in the dyrk nycht,
  A fayr brycht starn, rynnand with bemys cleir,
  Quhilk on the top of our lugyng, but weir,
  First saw we lycht, syne schynyng went awa                           5
  And hyd it in the forest of Ida,
  Markand the way quhidder at we suld spur;
  Thar followis a streym of fyre, or a lang fur,
  Castand gret lycht about quhar that it schane,
  Quhil al enveron rekit lyke bryntstane.                             10
  With that, my fader venquyst start on fute,
  And to the goddis carpis tobe our bute,
  The haly starn adornyt he rycht thar:
  Now, now, quod he, I tary na langar;

  O natyve goddis, ȝour awyn kynrent defend,
  Salwe ȝour nevo; ȝouris is this oracle,
  In ȝour protectioun is Troy, for this myracle
  I wil obey, and grantis onto ȝour will:
  My deir son, quhidder euer thou wend will,                          20

    Thus sayd he, and be than, thar and heir,
  Throw out the wallis the rerd of fyris grew
  Ay mair and mair, and the heit nerrar drew.
  Have done, quod I, fader, clym vp anone,                            25
  And set the evyn abuf my nek bone;
  Apon my schuldris I sal the beir, but weyr,
  Nor this lawbour sal do to me na deir:
  Quhat euer betyde, a weilfair and a skaith
  Salbe common and equale to ws baith.                                30
  Lytil Iulus salbeir me cumpany;

  And ȝe, my seruandis, tak held quhat I say;
  As ȝe pas furth of the cite this ilk way,
  Thar is a mote, quhar ane ald tempil, but les,                       5
  Now standis desert of the goddes Ceres,
  Besyde quham growis a sypir tre full auld,
  With forfaderis, feil ȝeris, in wirschip hald;
  In that place lat ws meit on athir syde.
  Fader, sen that we may na langar byde,                              10
  Tak vp tha haly rellykis in thi hand,
  And our penates or goddis of this land:

  From sa gret slauchter, blude schedding, and melle
  Newly departit, to twich thame, for the blude,                      15
  Quhil I be weschyn into sum rynnand flude.
    And sayng thus, I spred my schulderis brayd,
  Syne our my nek, abuf the wedis, laid
  A ȝallow skyn was of a fers lyoun,
  And tharapon gart set my fader down;                                20
  Lytil Iulus grippis me by the hand,
  With onmeit pays his fader fast followand;
  Neir at our bak Crevse, my spows, ensewys:

  And alkyn sterage affrayt, and causyt grow,

  Quhen we war cummyn almaist to the ȝet,                             30
  And al danger we thocht eschapit neyr,

  Cryis on me fast, fle son, fle son in hy!
  Thai cum at hand; behynd me I gat a sycht                            5
  Of lemand armour and schynand scheildis brycht,
  Thar knaw I nocht quhat fremmyt god onkynd
  So me astonyst, and rest fra me my mynd:
  For throu the secrete stretis fast I ran
  Befor the laif, as weil bekend man;                                 10
  Allace to me, catyve! I wait neuer quhydder
  My spows Crevse remanyt or we come thydder,
  Or by sum fait of goddis was reft away,
  Or gif scho errit, or irkit by the way;
  For nevir syne with eyn saw I hyr eft,                              15
  Nor neuer abak, fra scho was lost or reft,
  Blent I agane, nor perfyte mynd has nummyn,
  Quhil to the mote of Ceres war we cummyn.
  And fynaly, quhen we beyn gadderit thidder,

  Scho was away, and betrumpit suythly
  Hyr spows, hir son, and all the cumpany.
  Than wod for wo, so was I quyte myscaryit

  For quhat mair hard myschance, quhen Troy down fell,                25
  Apperit to me as that, or sa cruell?

  And eik our Troiane goddis penates,
  Onto my feris betauch I, for to keip,
  And hyd thame darn within a valy deip.                              30
  To town agane I sped with al my mycht,
  Claspit ful meit into fyne armour brycht,
  Wilful al aventuris newlyngis to assay,
  And forto sers Troy, euery streit, and way,
  And eik my hed agane in perrell set.                                 5

  Haldyng bakwart ilk futstep we had gane,
  Lukand and sersand about me as I myght.

  In euery place my spreit maid sayr agast.
  Fra thyne ontil our lugyng hame I past,
  To spy perchance gif scho had thidder returnyt;

  Alhail the hows with thame sa occupyit:                             15
  Belyve the fyre al waistand I espyit

  About the hals hir fortil haue belappit,
  And thrys, al waist, my handis togidder clappit:
  The figur fled as lycht wynd, or the son beym,
  Or maist lykly a waverand swevyn or dreym.                          30
    Thus finaly, the nycht al passit and gane,

  Of men and women gadderit al infeir,
  And ȝong pepil to pas in exile abill,
  And of commonys a sort sa miserabill,

  The Grekis than we se in the mornyng

  And thus, quhen na hope of reskew, at schort, is,

  And careit my fader to Ida hyll on hie.                             20

  I dreid men clepe thame fablis now on days;

CAP. I.

  _Quhou Eneas fra Troy has tane hys rays,
  And Polidorus graf has fund in Trace._


  Eftyr that seyn and thocht expedient
  Was by the goddys to dystroy and schent
  Of Asya the empyre, and down to bryng,
  But offens, Priamus pepil and ofspryng,
  And prowd Ilion was brokyn and bet down,                             5
  And from the soyl al Troy, Neptunus town,
  Ybrynt in smoke of flambis and in reik;
  Syndry landis and cuntreis forto seik,
  And wend exile in diuers nationys,
  Of the goddis by reuelacionys,                                      10
  We war admonyst feil syth, as is said.
  Schippis we graith, and navy reddy maid,
  Betwix Anthandros and the mont of Ida,
  Oncertane quhidder the fatis wald we suld ga,
  Or quhar we suld remane ȝit fynaly;                                 15
  Our men togidder gadderit we in hy.
  And skant begunnyn was the fresch veir,
  Quhen that Anchises, myne awyn fader deir,
  Bad ws mak sail and follow destany.
  Than, weping sayr, my native cost left I,
  The havynnys, and the feildis dissolait                              5
  Quhar Troys ryall cite stude of lait:
  Furth sail I banyst throw the deip see,
  With my ȝong son Ascanyus and our menȝe,
  And with our frendly goddis, Penates hait,
  And eik our gret Goddis of mair estait.                             10
    Thar lyis a weirly cuntre weil far thens,
  With large feildis lauborit ful of fens;
  Of Trace the pepill ar thar inhabityng,
  Quhar that vmquhile strang Lycurgus was kyng:
  Ane ancyant and ane tendir herbry place                             15
  To Troianys, quhil we stude in fortonys grace,
  Our pepil togidder confederate and aly.
  By schip thiddir, our sey, careit was I,
  Quhar, at the bayand costis syde of the see,
  Begouth I first set wallis of a cite,                               20
  Althocht my foundment was mysfortunat:
  The towne I nemmyt efter myne estait,
  And fra my name it clepit Eneadas.
  Onto my moder, of Dyona douchter was,
  Sacrifice I maid, and to the goddis all                             25
  Quham for new warkis men happy helparis call;
  And to the kyng of hevinly wightis, that tyde,
  A quhite bull slew I by the costis syde.
    On cace, thar stude a litil mote neir by,
  Quhar hepthorn buskis on the top grew hie,                          30
  And evin saplynnys of myrthus, the tre funerale.
  Thiddir I went, greyn bewis doune to haill,
  Hard by the grond myne altare forto dycht
  With burgyonys and with branchis al at rycht:
  A grysly takyn, feirful to tell, I se.                               5
  As from the soyll vprent was the first tre
  By the rutys, the blak droppis of blude
  Distillit tharfra, that al the erth quhar it stude
  Was spottit of the fylth, and stenyt, allaik!
  The cald dreid maid all my membris quaik,                           10
  And for effeir my blude togidder fresyt.
  Ane other smal twyst of a tre I chesit
  Forto brek down, the causys to assay
  Of this mater, that war onknawyn alway;
  And ȝit the blude followit on the sam maneir                        15
  Furth of the bark of that other, but weir.
  Than in my mynd of mony thingis I musyt,
  And to the goddessis of wildyrnes, as is vsyt,
  Quhilk Hamadriades hait, I wirschip maid;
  Onto Gradyus fader, that ryngnys glaid                              20

  Besekyng this avisioun worth happy,
  And the oracle prosperite suld signyfy.

  Quhilk was his son, to Polynestor kyng
  Of Trace, to kepe and haue in nurysyng,
  Quhen first of Troiane defens begouth he dowt,
  And saw the town besegyt all abowt.                                 20

  Al faith and frendschip brak he than in hy,                         25
  And Polydorus slane hes cruelly,
  And thus, be fors, the tresour he doith withhold.
  O cursyt hungyr of this wrachit gold!
  Quhat wikkytnes or myscheif may be do

  And set our navy to the wynd, but weir.

  _Quhou Eneas socht answer at Apollyne,
  And quhou he to the land of Crete is salyt syne._


  Syne, quhen we se our tyme to sail maist habill,
  The blastis mesit, and the fludis stabill,
  The softe piping wynd callyng to see,
  Thar schippis than furth settis our menȝe:
  Ȝe mycht haue sene the costis and the strandis                       5
  Fillit with portage and pepil tharon standis.
  Furth of the havin we salit al onone;
  The sicht of land and cite sone is gone.

  Quham the cheritabil archer, Appollo,
  Quhen it flet rollyng from costis to and fro,

  Quhilk clepit ar Mycone and Gyara,
  Stablisyng so that it mycht lauborit be,
  And comptis nowthir the wynd nor storm of see.
  Thidder ar we careit, and, in that plesand land,

  Al wery beyn we yschit furth of schip

  The kyng tharof, yclepit Anyvs,

  With bendis baith and haly lawrer crown
  Set on his hed, met ws withowt the town;
  His agit frend Anchises knew this kyng.
  Handis we schuke with hartly welcumyng,
  And to his palyce al with hym we went,                               5
  Quhar that I wirschip, as wes myne entent,

  Or tempil beldyt al of stanys ald.

  Geif ws thine answer quharon we sal depend;

  Quhar sall we set our lugyng to remane?
  Condiscend in our myndis, and schaw this plane.                     20
    Scars war thir wordis said, quhen that I se
  Al thingis trymmyl and schaik neir abowt me,
  The durris and the lawrer tre, but dowt,
  And al the montane movit rownd about:
  A murmur or a rumysyng hard we haue                                 25
  Within the courtyng and the secret cave;
  The quyet closettis oppynnyt with a rerd,
  And, we plat law gruflyngis on the erd,
  A voce com til our erys, sayand thus;
  O ȝe dowr pepil discend from Dardanus,                              30

  And thar sonnys, and sonnys sonnys syne,
  And al that evir succedis of thar lyne.
    Thus said Phebus; and than, our folkis amang,
  Mixt with blithnes a fellon dyn vpsprang:                           10
  Quhat place was this, euery ane fast gan frane,

  And leyr at me ȝour weilfair, I ȝou pray.
  The ile of Crete lyis amyd the see,
  The native land of Jupiter maist hie;
  Thar is the first hyll, yclepit Ida,
  Thar our forbearis first in thar credlys lay;                       20
  The land maist plentevs of wyne, oyl, and quhete,
  Inhabyt with a hundreth citeis gret,
  Quharfra thar com, gif I remembir rycht,

  First to the cost of Rethea in Phrygy,                              25
  And for his cite chesit the set fast by:
  For ȝit than was not Ilion vpbeld,
  Nor the strang wallis of Troy; bot on the feld
  Thai dwelt in lugys and mony litil cave.
  The adornar eik of our realm we haue                                30
  From that land, the moder of goddis Cybele,
  And blast of brasyn trumpettis, as ȝe se:
  From thens com eik the wod of Idea,
  And the traist serymonys of sacrifice alswa:
  The fasson eik and gys we lernyt thar                                5
  Quhou the lyonys suld draw the ladeis char.

  Thidder quhar the goddis oracle haith ws kend.
  The wynd first lat ws meys, or that we ga,
  Syne seik the realm of Crete and Gnosia:                            10
  It is not thens lang cowrs nor vyage far;
  Our navy sall, with help of Jupiter,
  The thrid morow be at the cost of Crete.
  This beand said, ganand offerandis ful mete
  Befor the altaris he slew in sacrifyce;                             15
  A bul first to Neptune, as is the gys,
  A bull to brycht Appollo for his beheist,
  And to the god of tempestis a blak beist,
  And to the chancy wyndis ane mylk quhite.
    The fame was than, of Crete the cost stude quyte                  20
  Dissolate, but prince; for Idomeneus the kyng
  Was by the pepil expellit from his ryng,
  The lugyngis voyd and reddy to thar fays,
  The sete left waist til ony it vptais.
  The porte tharwith, Ortygia, leif we,                               25
  And with swift cowrs flaw throu the salt see;
  By the iland swepit we onon
  With hillis ful of wynys, hait Naxon,
  By Donysa quhar growis the marbill greyn,
  And by Paron with his quhite marbill scheyn,                        30
  By Olearon, and mony ilis, but les,

  To speid thame fast towart the realm of Crete,
  With thar forfaderis and progenitouris to mete.
  The followand wynd blew strek in our tail,
  Quhill finaly arrive we, with bent saill,                           10
  Apon the ancyant cost of Curetanys,
  A kynd of pepill quhilk into Crete remanys.
  And sone I me enfors with diligence
  To byg a wallit cite of defens;
  Pargamea I namyt it, but baid:                                      15
  Our folkis than, that warryn blyth and glaid
  Of this kowth surname of our new cite,

  And rays on hycht the strenth and fortales.

  And I thar statutis and seyr lawis thame tawcht,                    25
  Assyngnand ilkane propir howsis and aucht.

  So that cornys and frutis goith to wraik,

  Delyvs Apollo, certis, as thou thocht,

  A land thar is, in Grekis langage plane

  A fructuus grond of corn and riches seir,

  Bot in our days laitly, the fame is syne,
  Eftir thar duke it is namyt Italy:
  Thar beyn our propir setis and our herbry;                          30

  And from that ilk prince, Schir Dardanus,

  For the feldis in Crete neyr Dycteus

    Of this visioun estonyst quhar I lay,
  And of tha wordis quhilkis the goddis gan say,                      10
  (For this wes nowthir dreym nor fantasy;

  Furth of my bed on fute son sprent I than,
  And, strekand vp my handis towart hevyn,

  And of our clan the dowbill stok full weill:

  Of ancyant placis, quhilk he not persavit.
  Syne said he, son, thou irkit art al gatis
  By the contrarius frawart Troiane fatis;                            30
  Now I remembir only quhou Cassandra
  Ful oft maid mensioun of Hesperya,
  And oft als of the realm hait Italy,

  Lat ws obey Phebus, and wend awa,                                   10
  As we bene monyst, follow our chance, but pleys.
  Thus said he, and we glaid al hym obeys:
  A few folkis thar left to kepe the town,
  This sted alsso leif we, and sail maid bown;
  In bowit bargis throu the large streym we slyde.                    15

  On far the land appeir, and hillis rys,
  The smoky vapour vpcasting on thar gys.

  _Quhou till Ene the harpyes dyd gret wo,
  And of the drery prophete Celeno._


  Strophades in Grew leid ar nemmyt so,
  In the gret sey standing ilis two;
  The quhilk sey clepit is Ionium;
  And, in thir ilandis quhidder we ar becum,
  Dwelt and inhabit the cruel Celeno,
  With all the otheris harpeys mony mo,
  Evir sen thai war expeld from the land                               5
  Of Arcad, quhar kyng Phyneus was dwelland,
  And for dreid at his tabil durst not remane.
  Mair wikkit monstreis than thai kan be nane,
  Nor nane mair cruel pestilens is fund,
  Nor fury of goddis that cummys from hellis grund,                   10
  Furth of the flude of Stix that sory place.
  Thir fowlis hes a vyrgynys wlt and face,
  With handis like to bowland byrdis clewis;

  And pail al tyme thar mowthis miserabill
  For wod hungyr and gredy appetite.
    At this ilke cost as we arryvit, als tyte,
  And in the port entrit, lo! we se
  Flokkis and herdis of oxin and of fe,                               20
  Fat and tydy, rakand our alquhar,
  And trippis eik of gait, but ony kepar,
  In the rank gyrs pasturyng on raw;
  With wapynnys thame we brittyn, but dreid or aw:
  To goddis syne and Jupiter we pray,                                 25
  And thame distribut a party of our pray.
  Syne eftir, endlang the sey costis bay,
  Vp sonkis set, and desys dyd array;
  To meit we sat with habundans of cheir:
  Quhen suddanly, with horribill dyn and beir,                        30
  From the montanys the harpeis on vs fell,
  With huge fard of weyngis and mony a ȝell.
  Our mesis and our mete thai reft away,
  And with thar laithly twich al thing fyle thai;

  With sa corruppit flewyr nane mycht byde neir.
  From that place syne ontil a caif we went,
  Vndir a hyngand hewch, in a dern went,
  With treys clos bilappit rownd about,
  And thik harsk granyt pikis standing owt:                           10
  Thar, vp agane, our tabillis haue we dicht,
  And on the altaris bet the fyris bricht.
  Bot, of the hevin agane from syndry artis,
  Out of quyet hyrnys, the rowt vpstartis
  Of thai birdis, with byr and mony a bray,                           15
  And in thar crukyt clawis grippis the pray:
  Evir as thai fle about fra sete to sete,
  With thar vyle mowthis infek thai al our mete.
  Quhen I saw this, our feris command I than
  Tak thar wapynnys, and bargane euery man                            20

  And darnly eik thar targis al ourheildis;                           25
  So that, quhen the sey costis and the feildis
  Resoundis at down come of thir harpeys,

  And, with his trumpet, thame a takyn maid.
  Our falloschip thir fowlys gan invayd,                              30
  And onkouth kynd of batail dyd assay,

  Becaus ȝe have our oxin reft and slane,                             15

  But ony offens, furth of thar faderis ryng?
  Ressave for that, and in ȝour brestis enprent

  Schawis ȝou; that thing quhilk Jupiter maist hie

  I knaw ȝe set ȝour cowrs to Italy:
  Ȝe cal eftir gude wyndis and prospir sky:
  To Itale sal ȝe wend, and thar tak land.                            25

  Quhilk by the goddis is ȝou predestinate,
  For strang hungir sal ȝe stand in sik state,
  In wraik of our iniuris and bestis slane,

  And runge ȝour tabillis al and burdis, quod sche;

  In cace gif thai war goddessis or fowlis,

  Bot our fader, hevand vp his handis,
  The gret goddis dyd call, and on the sandis

  Salve petuus folkis, ameys ȝour wrath and greif,

  And followit furth the sammyn went we have,

  And Neritos with his rochis hie;
  By craggis and hewys of Itachia,
  That was Laertes realm, we slyde alswa,
  And fast we wary and cursyt oft, but les,

CAP. V.

  _Eneas arryvis at Epyria,
  And how he spak thar with Andromacha._


  Be this the son had circulit his lang ȝer,
  And frosty wyntir scharpit the watir cleir
  With cald blastis of the northin art.
  Quhen sesson come that tyme was to depart,
  Apon a post in the tempyl I hang
  A bowand scheild of plait, quhilk Abas strang
  Bair vmquhile, and, the maner to rehers,                             5
  I notyfy and tytillis with this vers,
  _Eneas hec de Danais victoribus arma;_
  That is to say, Eneas festnyt thus
  This armour of the Grekis victorius.
  Syne, to depart of that havyn, I command                            10
  Syt down on hechis, and span aris in hand.
  Byssely our folkis gan to pyngil and stryve,
  Swepand the flude with lang rowthys belyve,
  And vp thai welt the stowr of fomy see;
  Quhil sone the citeis of Corsyra tyne we,                           15
  And vp we pyke the cost of Epyrus,
  And landit thar at port Chaonyus:
  Syne to the hie town of Butrot ascendit;
  Quhar tythingis, oncredibill to thame not kend it,
  Come to our erys, schawyng that Helenus,                            20
  The lauchful son of the kyng Priamus,

  Berand tharof the ceptre and the wand,
  By resson of his spows adionyt, but les,

  And that Andromacha wes wed agane
  Onto ane other husband and man Troiane.
  Heirof awondrit, with breist hait as fyre,
  Be fervent luf kendillit in gret desyre

  To knaw thir strange casys, on I stalk
  From the port, my navy left in the raid.
    That ilke sesson, percace, as I furth glaid,
  Befor the cite, in a schaw, I wys,
  Besyde the fenȝeit flude of Symois,
  Andromache maid anniuersar sacrifyce                                 5
  And funerale servyce, on ful dolorus wys,

  Quhilk scho vpbeildit had of herbis greyn,
  With twa altaris; and oft with wepyng eyn
  Bewalis scho that hard dissyverance.
  And alssone as scho me aspyis perchance,
  And Troiane armour and ensenȝeis with me saw,                       15
  Affrayit of the ferly, scho stude syk aw,
  And at the fyrst blenk become so mait,

  Quhil to the grond half mangit fel scho down,
  And lay a lang tyme in a dedly swown                                20

  And, with that word, scho bryst furth mony a teir,
  And walit so that piete was to heir,
  Quhil al about dynnys of hir womentyng.
  A few wordis skars as I mycht furth bryng,                          30
  For to comfort that maist lamentabill wight,
  With langsum speche said, quhispirand, as I mycht;

  Or quhat fortune mycht sufficient happyn the,

  Art thou, or na, to Pirrus ȝit bywed?
    Hyr vissage down scho kest, for schame adred,
  And, with a bas voce, thus said, as scho mycht;
  O thou alane, befor al madynnys bricht,
  Happy was, virgyne douchtir of Priam kyng,                          15
  Quhilk, vnder the wallis hie of Troys ryng,
  Apon thine ennemeis grafe was maid to de;

  Nor in bondage away was thou nocht led,
  Nor ȝit twichit na victour lordis bed.                              20
  Bot we, quhen that ybrynt war our kynd landis,

  In bondage, vndir the prowd Pyrrus ȝyng,

  Quhil he at last ensewit ane othir may,

  In fey wedlok at Lachidemonya;
  Than send he me, his seruand, hiddir thus,
  Tobe spowsit with his seruand Helenus.                              30

  Thus, by deces of Neoptolymus,
  Of the realm a part fell to Helenus;
  The quhilk boundis and feildis braid alsswa

  And on thir motis a strenth hait Ilion.
  Bot quhat wyndis thi cowrs has hydder gone?
  And quhat aventur has the hyddir dryve?                             15
  Or of the goddis quha maid the heir arrive

CAP. VI.

  _Quhou Helenus declaris tyll Ene
  Quhat dangeris he suld thoill on land and see._


  Thus drave we our in solace day be day,
  Quhil at the weddir prouokis ws to assay                            20
  Our salis agane; for the sowth wyndis blast
  Our piggeis and our pynsalis wavit fast.
  Onto the prophet Helenus tho went I,
  And with syk wordis besocht hym reuerently;
  O gentil Troiane, dyvyne interpretur,
  Quhilk the respons of Phebus hes in cur;
  Quhilk knawist eik the reuelationys                                  5

  Vndir hys trestis and burdis at Delphois schene,
  And into Claryus vndir the lawrer grene
  That vnderstandis the cowrs of euery star
  And chyrm of euery byrdis voce on far,                              10
  And euery fowle on weyng fleyng in the sky,
  Quhat thai betakyn, and quhat thai signyfy;
  Say me, I pray the, quhat dangeris principaly
  In to my cowrs and vayage eschew sall I,
  Or how I may, or be quhat meyn, eschaip                             15
  Sa gret aduersiteis quhilkis beyn to me schaip.
  For as to me al devote godly wightis
  Schew we suld haue a prospir rays at rychtis,
  And euery oracle of goddis admonyst eik
  That we the realm of Italy suld seik,                               20
  Ensew tha landis quhilkis war for ws provyde
  Alanerly newlyngis on that other syde;

  Spays onto ws a feirful takyn of wo;
  A vengeans from the goddis pronuncis sche,                          25
  With schameful hungir sal happyn our menȝe.
    Helenus than, eftir the rytis and gyis,
  The ȝong bestis slew in sacryfys,
  Purchesyng favour of goddis to stanch thar fed,
  And lowsit the garlandis of his haly hed:                           30
  Syne me, Phebus, he ledis by the hand
  Onto thi tempil, on seyr materis musand;
  Quhar this gret preist gan spekyn and declar
  To me thir wordis of the goddis answar:
    Son of the goddes, sen traist is manifest                          5
  That throu deip seys thi wayage is addrest,
  And eik, of forton by the boundis hie,
  The purviance dyvyne wil so it be;
  The kyng of goddis so distributis the fatis,
  Rollyng the chancis, and turnyng thame thusgatis;                   10
  Of mony wordis, schortly, a quhoyn sall I
  Declare, at thou mayr sovirly tharby
  May seik out throu the strange stremys onkend.
  And at a port of Itale arryve at end:
  The remanent heirof, quhat evyr be it,                              15
  The werd Systeris defendis that suld be wyt,
  And eik the douchtir of auld Saturn, Juno,
  Forbyddis Helenus to speik it, and cryis, ho!

  And Avernus, clepit the layk of hell,
  And Aheie, the ile quhar Circes dwell,                              30
  Or euer thou may sovirly vpbeild

  And of ȝour travell ferm hald to rest in le.

  And, neir the hill that Salentynus hecht,
  The feildis all ar occupyit full meit                               25
  Be Idomeneus the kyng expellit from Crete;
  Thar is alsso the litil cite, but les,
  Of the Duke of Melyboy, Phyloctetes,
  Clepit Petilya, closyt with a wall:
  Eschew thir citeis and thyr costis all.                             30
  Forthir, quhen that beȝond the sey sall stand

  Tha leiffis remanys onsterit of thar place,
  Ne partis not furth of rewle, quhil per cace

  And dryve the leiffis, and blaw thaim out of har

  Ne forto put thame into rewle agane,
  Nor jone hir writis as thai dyd first remane.
  Thus oft the pepil but answer gays thar ways,
  And wareis the set of Sybil al thar days.

  Bot thou pas to that prophetes, thocht the tyde

  Of thi devote son by the godly estate.
  Bot quharto suld I mak langar delay?

  And, onto Juno of Arge, our sacryfys

  Onon the nokkis of our rays we writh;
  Down fallys the schetis of the salys swith:                         30
  The Gregionys herbry and fronteris suspek

  Quhar as the swelch had the rolkis thyrlyt;
  And thrys the fame furth spowt, that so hie quhirlyt

  Than suddanly, furth of the woddis ronk,

  At the first sicht he styntit and stude aw,
  And fra hys pays begouth abak to draw;                              10
  Bot sone eftyr cummys rynnyng in a rays

  And on this wys begouth to carp and say;
    Of the realm Itachia I am, but les,
  And of the cumpany of fey Vlixes,

  A gowsty hald within, laithly to se,
  Ful of vennom and mony bludy meys.

  For sammyn as that horribyll fendlich wight

  Raw lumpys of flesch and blude blandyt with wyne.

  And, with a scharpyt and brynt steyng of tre,
  Out dyd we boyr and pyke hys mekil E,

  Als braid as is a Gregioun scheild or targe,                        20

  And thus at last haue we ravengit soyn

  Bot ȝhe, onhappy men, fle from this sted,

  For quhou grysly and how gret I ȝou sayn

  And al thar pappis mylkis throuch and throuch,

  In desert hyrnys and seyr wild beistis den,
  And far out from my cavern dyd aspy

  And eik stamping of thar feyt maid me trymmyl.

  _Of Poliphemus, and mony strange cost,
  And how Ene hys fader in Sycill lost._


  Skars this wes sayd, quhen sone we gat a sycht
  Apon ane hyll stalkand this hydduus wight,
  Amang hys beystis, the hyrd Poliphemus,
  Down to the costis bekend draw towartis ws:
  A monstre horribyll, onmesurabill and myschaip,
  Wanting hys syght, and gan to stab and graip
  With hys burdon, that wes a gret fyr tre,                            5
  Fermand his steppis, becaus he mycht not se;
  The wollyt scheip him followyng at the bak,
  Quharin his plesur and delyte gan he tak.
  About hys hals a quhissil hung had he,
  Wes all his solace for tynsell of hys E;                            10
  And, with his staf fra he the deip flude
  Twichit, and cummyn at the seysyde stude,
  Of hys E dolp the flowand blude and attir
  He wysch away al with the salt wattir,
  Grassilland his teith, and rummysand full hie.                      15
  He wadis furth throu myddis of the see,
  And ȝit the wattir wet not hys lang syde.
    We, far from thens affrayt, durst not abyde,
  Bot fled onon, and within burd hes brocht
  That faithful Greik quhilk ws of succurs socht,                     20
  And prevyly we smyte the cabill in twane;
  Syne, kempand with aris in al our mane,
  Vp weltris watir of the salt sey flude.
  He persauyt the sownd, quhar that he stude,
  And towart the dyn movis hys pays onon:                             25
  Bot quhen he felt at we sa far war gone,
  Sa that his handis ws areke ne mycht,
  Nor the deip sey Ionium, for all hys hycht,
  Ne mycht he waid equale ws to arest,
  A fellon bray and huge schowt vp he kest,                           30
  Quharthrou the sey and al the fludis schuke;
  The land alhail of Itail trymlyt and qwoyk;
  And holl cavernys or furnys of Ethna rownd
  Rummyst and lowyt, fordynnyt with the sound.
  Bot than, furth of the woddis and hillys hie,                        5
  Walkynnyt with the cry, a huge pepill we se
  Of Ciclopes cum hurland to the port,
  And fillyt all the cost sydis at schort.

  Or than thir cipressis berand heich thar bewys,                     15
  Growand in the woddis or hie vp on hewis,
  In schawys ald, as men may se from far,
  Hallowyt to Dyane or ȝit to Jupiter.
  The scharp dreid maid ws so to cach haist,
  Withdrawand fast, as thocht we had bene chaist,                     20
  And for to set our sail quhidder we best mycht,
  To follow the wynd, and hald na courssis rycht.

  For, bot we hald that cours, for owtyn fail,

  And sone we swepyt by, at the fyrst bront,

  For we return the sammyn went agane
  Quhar thar navy had waverit by thar rays.
    Within the fyrth of Sycill, forgane the face                      10
  Of the flude Plemyrion full of wallis,
  Thar lyis ane Iland, quhilk our elderis callis

  Of the cite of Elys in Archaid,                                     15
  Vndir the sey gan thyddir flow and wayd

  At command of my fader; and fra thyne
  The fertill grond of Helory passyt syne,

  For on blynd stanys and rolkis hyrslit we,                          25

  Havand the surname fra the flude fast by:
  Syne heich Agragas far of we gan aspy,

  Quhar vmquhile bred war the maist weirlyke hors:

  Ressauyt me, quhar that, allace, allace!

  Anchises, desolate quhy left thou me heir

  O weilaway! for nocht wes all, I fand,

  Quhen horribill thingis seir he dyd aduert,
  Schew not befor to me thir harmys smert,
  Nor ȝit the fellon and akwart Celeno.
  This wes extreme laubour of pane and wo;
  Thys was the end of all hys lang vayage:                            25
  And hyddir syne, warpyt with seys rage,

  O luf, quhidder art thou joy or fulychnes,
  That makis folk sa glaid of thar distres?

  Salomonys wyt, Sampson thou rubbist hys fors,
  And Dauid thou byreft hys prophecy;
  Men says thou brydillyt Aristotyll as ane hors,                     10
  And crelyt vp the flour of poetry:
  Quhat sal I of thi myghtis notyfy?
  Fair weil, quhar that thy lusty dart assalis,
  Wyt, strenth, ryches, na thyng bot grace avalis.

  Thou cheyn of luf, ha benedicite!                                   15
  Quhou hard strenys thi bandis euery wyght!
  The god abuf, from his hie maieste,
  With the ybond, law in a maid dyd lycht;
  Thou venquyst the strang gyant of gret mycht;
  Thou art mair forcy than the ded sa fell;                           20
  Thou plenyst paradyce, and thou heryt hell.

  Thou makist febill wight, and lawyst the hie;
  Thou knyttis frendschyp quhar thar beyn na parage;
  Thou Jonathas confederat with Davy;
  Thou dantyt Alexander for all his vaslalage;                        25
  Thou festnyt Jacob fourteyn ȝheir in bondage;
  Thou techit Hercules go lern to spyn,
  Reke Dyomeir hys mays and lyoun skyn.

  For luf Narsysus perysyt at the well;
  For luf thou stervyst most douchty Achill;
  Thesyus, for luf, hys fallow socht to hell;
  The snaw quhyte dow oft to the gray maik will.
  Allace! for luf how mony thame self dyd spill!                       5
  Thy fury, luf, moderis taucht, for dispyte,
  Fyle handis in blude of thar ȝong chyldering lyte.

  O Lord, quhat writis myne author of thi fors,
  In hys Georgikis! quhou thyne ondantyt myght
  Constrenys so sum tyme the stonyt hors                              10
  That, by the sent of a meyr far of syght,
  He bradis brays onon, and takis the flyght;
  Na brydill may hym dant nor bustuus dynt,
  Nowther bra, hie roch, nor brayd fludis stynt.

  The bustuus bullys oft, for the ȝong ky,                            15
  With horn to horn wyrkis othir mony a wound,
  So rumysyng with hydduus lowand cry
  The feildis all doith of thar rowstis resound:
  The meyk hartis, in bellyng, oft ar fond

  Baris twyte thar tuskis, and fret otheris skyn.

  Quhilk thar he writis of Leander ȝyng,
  Quhou for thi luf, Hero, allace, allace!
  In fervent flambe of hait desyre byrnyng,                           25
  By nychtis tyde, the hevynys lowd thundering,
  And, all with storm trublyt, the seys flude
  Bettand on the rolkis, and rowtand as it war wod;

  Set he hym not to swym our, wallaway!
  The fyrth betwix Sestos and Abydane,
  In Europe and in Asya citeis tway;
  Hys fader and moder mycht hym not call agane:
  O God, quhat harm! thar wes he drynt and slane;                      5
  And quhen his lufe saw this myscheif, atanys
  Out our the wall scho lap, and brak hir banys.

  Lo, quhou Venus kan hir seruandis acquyte!
  Lo, quhou hir passionys onbridillis al thar wyt!
  Lo, quhou thai tyne thame self for schort delyte!                   10
  Lo, from all grace quhou to myscheif thai flyt,
  Fra weil to sturt, fra payn to ded! and ȝyt
  Thar beyn bot few exempil takis of othir,
  Bot wilfully fallys in the fyre, leif brothir.

  Be nevir our set, myne author techis so,                            15
  With lust of wyne nor warkis veneryane;
  Thai febill the strenth; revelys secrete bath two
  Stryfe and debait engendris, and feil hes slane;
  Honeste, prowes, dreid, schame and luk ar gane
  Quhar thai habound; attempyr thame for thy.                         20
  Childir to engendir oys Venus, and not invane;
  Hant na surfat, drynk bot quhen thou art dry.

  Quhat? is this lufe, nys luffaris, at ȝe meyn,
  Or fals dissait fair ladeys to begile?
  Thame to defowle, and schent ȝour self betweyn,                     25
  Is al ȝour lykyng, with mony suttel wyle.
  Is that trew lufe, gude faith and fame to fyle?
  Gyf luf be vertu, than is it lefull thing;
  Gif it be vyce, it is ȝour ondoyng.

  Lust is na lufe, thocht ledis lyke it weill;
  This furyus flambe of sensualite
  Ar nane amouris bot fantasy ȝe feill:                                5
  Carnale plesance, but syght of honeste,
  Hatis hym self forsuyth, and luffis nocht the:
  Thare beyn twa luffis, perfyte and imperfyte,
  That ane leful, the tother fowle delyte.

  Lufe is a kyndly passioun, engendryt of heyt                        10
  Kyndlyt in the hart, ourspredyng al the cors:
  And, as thou seys sum person waik in spreyt,
  Sum hait byrnyng as ane onbridillyt hors;
  Lyke as the pacient hes heyt of our gret fors,
  And in ȝong babbys warmnes insufficient,                            15
  And into agyt failȝeis, and is out quent;

  Rycht so in luf thou may be excessyve,
  Inordinatly luffand ony creature;
  Thi luf alsso it may be defectyve,
  To luf thine awin and geif of otheris na cure:                      20
  Bot quhar that lufe is rewlyt by messure,
  It may be lyknyt to ane hail mannis estait,
  In temperat warmnes, nowthir to cald nor hait.

  Than is thi lufe inordinat, say I,
  Quhen ony creatur mair than God thou luffis,                        25
  Or ȝit luffis ony to that fyne, quharby
  Thi self or thame thou frawartis God remufis:
  Fortil attempir thine amouris the behuffis:
  Lufe euery wyght for God, and to gude end,
  Thame be na wys to harm, bot to amend.

  That is to knaw, lufe God for his gudnes,                            5
  With hart, hail mynde, trew servyce, day and nycht;
  Nixt luf thi self, eschewand wykkytnes;
  Lufe syne thi nychtburris, and wyrk thame nane onrycht,
  Willyng at thou and thai may haue the syght
  Of hevynnys blys, and tyste thame not tharfra,                      10
  For, and thou do, syk luf dowe nocht a stra.

  Faynt lufe, but grace, for all thi fenȝeit layis,
  Thy wantoun willis ar verray vanyte;
  Grasles thou askis grace, and thus thou prayis;
  Haue mercy, lady, haue reuth and sum piete!                         15
  And scho, reuthtles, agane rewys on the:
  Heir is na paramouris fund, bot all haitrent,
  Quhar nowthir to weill nor resson tak thai tent.

  Callys thou that reutht, quhilk of thar self ne rakkis?
  Or is it grace to fall fra grace? nay, nay;                         20
  Thou sekis mercy, and tharof myscheif makkis:
  Renown and honour quhy wald thou dryfe away?
  A brutale appetyte makis ȝong fulys forvay,
  Quhilk be resson lyst not thar heyt refreyn,
  Haldand opynyon deyr of a boryt beyn.                               25

  Says nocht ȝour sentens thus, skant worth a fas,
  Quhat honeste or renoun is to be dram?
  Or forto drowp lyke a fordullyt as?
  Lat ws in ryot leif, in sport and gam;

  Fra nobylnes, welth, prudens and temperance,                        15

  So wes in lufe thi frawart destane:

  Smytyn so deip with the blynd fyre of lufe
  Hir trublyt mynd gan fra all rest remufe.
  Compasing the gret prowes of Ene,                                    5

  Now, certis, war it not determyt with me,
  And fixit in my mynd onmovabilly,

  For euermair with hym he sal thame haue,
  And he most keip thame with hym in his grave.

  As Phebus rays, fast to the ȝettis thringis
  The chos gallandis, and huntmen thame besyde,
  With ralys and with nettys strang and wyde,
  And huntyng sperys styf with hedis braid:                            5
  From Massillyne horsmen thik thiddir raid,
  With rynnyng hundis, a full huge sort.
  Nobillys of Cartage, hovand at the port,
  The Queyn awatys that lang in chawmyr dwellys:
  Hyr fers steyd stude stampyng, reddy ellys,                         10
  Rungeand the fomy goldyn byt gynglyng;
  Of gold and pal wrocht hys rych harnasyng:
  And scho, at last, of palyce yschit owt,
  With huge menȝe walking hir abowt,
  Lappyt in a brusyt mantill of Sydony,                               15
  With gold and perle the bordour al bewry,
  Hyngand by hir syde the cays with arowis grund;
  Hir bricht tressis envolupyt war and wond
  Intil a quayf of fyne gold wyrin threid;
  The goldyn button claspyt hir purpour weid:                         20
  And furth scho passyt with all hir cumpany.
  The Troiane pepill forgaderit by and by,
  Joly and glaid the fresch Ascanyus ȝyng.
  Bot first of all, maist gudly, hym self thar kyng
  Enee gan entir in falloschip, but dout,
  And onto thame adionyt hys large rowt.
  Lyke quhen Apollo list depart or ga

  And leif the flude Exanthus for a quhile,                            5
  To vissy Delos, his moderis land and ile,
  Renowand ryngis and dansys, mony a rowt;
  Mixt togiddir, hys altaris standing about,
  The pepil of Creit, and thame of Driopes,
  And eik the payntit folkis Agathirces,                              10
  Schowtand on thar gys with clamour and vocis hie:

  Hys wavand haris, sum tyme, doyng doun thryng
  With a soft garland of lawrer sweit smellyng;
  And vmquhile thame gan balmyng and enoynt,                          15
  And into gold addres, at full gude poynt;
  Hys grundyn dartis clattering by hys syde.
  Als fresch, als lusty dyd Eneas ryde;
  With als gret bewte in hys lordly face.
    And eftyr thai ar cummyn to the chace,                            20
  Amang the montanys in the wild forest,
  The rynnyng hundis of cuppillys sone thai kest,
  And our the clewys and the holtis, belyve,
  The wild beistis doun to the dail thai dryve.
  Lo! thar the rays, rynnyng swyft as fyre,                           25
  Drevyn from the hyghtis, brekkis out at the swyre:
  Ane othir part, syne ȝondyr mycht thou se
  The herd of hartis with thar hedis hie,
  Ourspynnerand with swyft cours the plane vaill,
  The hepe of duste vpstowryng at thair taill,                        30
  Fleand the hundis, levand the hie montanys.
  And Ascanyus, the child, amyd the planys,
  Joyus and blith hys startling steid to assay,
  Now makis his rynk ȝondir, and now this way
  Now prekis furth by thir, and now by thame;                          5
  Langyng, amang faynt frayt beistis ontame,
  The fomy bair, doun from the hyllis hycht,
  Or the dun lyoun discend, recontyr he mycht.
    In the meyn quhile, the hevynnys al about
  With fellon noys gan to rummyll and rowt.                           10
  A bub of weddir followyt in the tayll,
  Thik schour of rayn myddillit ful of haill.
  The Tyriane menȝe skales wydequhar,
  And al the gallandis of Troy fled heir and thar;
  And eik with thame the ȝong Ascanyus,                               15
  Nevo to kyng Dardan and to Venus.
  For feir, to diuers stedis throu the feildis,
  Thai seik to haldis, howsis, hyrnys and beildis:
  The ryveris rudly ruschit our hillis bedene.
  Within a cave is entrit Dido queyn,                                 20
  And eik the Troiane duke, al thame alane,
  By aventur, as thai eschewyt the rane.
  Erth, the first moder, maid a takyn of wo,
  And eik of wedlok the pronuba Juno,
  And of thar cuplyng wittering schew the ayr:                        25
  The flambe of fyreslaucht lychtnyt heir and thar
  And on the hillys hie toppis, but les,
  Sat murnand nymphis, hait Oreades.
  This wes the formaste day of hir glaidnes,
  And first morrow of hir wofull distres.                             30
  For nother the fasson nor the maner sche
  Attendis now, nor fame, ne honeste;
  Ne, from thens furthwart, Dido ony mor
  Musis on lufe secrete, as of befor,
  Bot clepis it spousage; and, with that fayr name,                    5
  Clokyt and hyd hir cryme of oppyn schame.

  Of hard Atlas, baryng on his crown the hevyn;                       30
  The mysty clowdis cirkilland his hed about,
  Quharon of fyrryn treis stant mony rowt,
  With wynd and storm full oft to schaik and blaw;

  Lyke till a fowle that, endlang the cost syde,
  About the strandis, of fysch plentuus, and wyde,

  Betwix the hevyn and erth, the sam wys, flaw

  Discendyng from hys moder granscher thus;
  The sandy costis and desertis of Lyby,
  And eik the wyndis, persyng by and by.
    And, with the weyngit solys of hys feyt,

  And garrand beild new lugyngis byssyly:

  Bet of a purpour claith of Tyre glittering,

  Of mychty Didois gift wrocht all his wedis.
  Mercur recontris hym, and said onon:

  Quhat beildis thou heir in Lyby or Cartage?
  Or to quhat fyne or beleif takis on hand

  Furth of this mortale syght, in the schyre ayr.




CAP. VI.

  _Quhou Eneas hym grathys to depart,
  To quhom Dido heir carpys with sayr hart._


  Bot than Ene half mad and dum stude als,
  Vpstart his hair, the voce stak in his hals.
  Sayr he langis to fle and to depart;
  And that sweit cuntre, on the tother part,
  To leif ful laith wes hym, or go at large.
  Astonyst he wes to syt sa hie a charge,
  Or dysobey the gret godis beheste.                                   5
  Allace! quhat suld he do? oneth he wist;
  Or with quhat wordis suld he now assay
  The amorus queyn forto requir and pray,
  Or on quhat wys hys taill he mycht begyn;                           10
  Baith to and fra compasyng, hys breist within,
  Feill purpossys for euery part about.
  And, at the last, thus as he stude in dout,
  Thys resson hym semyt fynaly the best:
  He callys to hym Mynestheus and Sergest,                            15
  And strang Cloanthus; and bad thai suld, in hy,
  Do graith hys schyppys and navyn secretly,
  And gaddir hys folkis towart the cost togydder;
  Armour and al thyng necessar bring thyddir,
  And to dissymyll, gif ony axit quhy                                 20
  Thai thus addressyt thar geyr sa suddanly:
  Hym self, he said, the meyn quhile, suld assay
  To purches leif to pas and go away,
  And wait hys tyme to speke tharof maist habill,
  Quhen that the queyn Dido, maist honorabil,                         25
  Suld not beleif sa sone he kouth depart,
  Nor sa gret luf dissyvir mycht be na art.
  At hys command thai al glaidly furth went,
  And bissely begouth speid hys entent.
    Bot sone the queyn persavyt al the slycht:
  Quhay may begile a luffar, day or nycht?                            30
  Thar departing at hand fyrst scho aspyis,
  Dredyng all sovir thing, as is the gys
  Of euery luffar al tyme to stand in feir.
  This ilke cursyt Fame, we spak of eyr,
  Bair to the amorus queyn noys, and gan rown,                         5
  The schippis ar grathand, to pas thai mak thaim boun.
  Quharfor, inpacient, and myndles in hir rage,
  Scho wyskis wild throu the town of Cartage;
  Syk wys, as quhen thir nunnys of Bachus
  Ruschis and relis our bankis, brays, and bus,                       10
  Quhen, euery thryd ȝeir, on thar payane gys,
  Thar goddis feist thai hallow with lowd cryis,
  That, al the nycht, the mont of Cytheron
  Resoundis of thar clamour, quhar thai gone.
  And at the last, ȝit thus, of hir fre will,                         15
  Eftir lang musyng, scho spak Eneas tyll:
    With dissymulance wenyt thou, onfaithfull wight,
  Thou mycht haue hyd fra me sa fals a slycht,
  And, myne onwyttyng, steill furth of my land?
  That nothir our gret lufe, promys, nor rycht hand                   20
  Gevyn me vmquhile, may the heir withhald,
  Nor cruel deth of Didois cors so cald!
  Gif thou depart, and forthir quhat wald thou do,
  In wyntir sesson pres graith thi navy, lo!
  And the addres to pas throu the wod see,                            25
  Myd tyme quhen stormys and wyndis blaw maist hie;
  Art thou sa cruel? I put the cace, alsso,
  That to nane onkouth landis the list go,
  Nother to fremmyt place, nor stedis will,
  Bot that auld Troy war ȝyt vpstandand still;                        30
  Aucht thou, ȝit than, leif this weilfair and joy,
  And in sik perrell seik throu the sey to Troy?
  Quhat! wilt thou fle from me? allace! allace!
  Be all thir teris trygland our my face,
  And be that rycht hand vmquhile thou me gave;                        5
  Sen to my self nocht ellis left I have,
  Now wrachit catyve; be our treuth plychting eyk,
  And be our spowsage begunnyn, I the beseik,
  Gif euer ony thank I deservit towart the,
  Or ocht of myne to the wes leif, quod sche,                         10
  Haue mercy of our lynnage reddy to spill;
  Gif tyme remanys ȝit thou heir prayeris will,
  This fremmyt mynd, I pray ȝou, do away.
  For the I haue beyn hatyt, this mony a day,
  With all the pepill of Affrik, and with the kyng                    15
  That rewlys the land of Numyda and ryng;
  For the myne awyn Tyrianys ar with me wraith;
  For the is womanheid went and wirschip baith,
  And my first fame, lavd, and renownye,
  Quharby I wes rasyt to the starnys hie.                             20
  Reddy to de, and my selvyn to spill,
  My sweit gest, quhamto thou me leif will?
  My gest, ha God! quhou al thyng now invane is,
  Quhen of my spows nane othir name remanys!
  Bot quharto suld I my ded langar delay?                             25
  Sal I abyde quhil thou be went away,
  And quhil myne awyn brothir, Pigmaleon,
  Bet down the wallis of my cite onon,
  Or stern Hyarbas, kyng of Getule,
  Led me away into captiuite?                                         30
  Bot, at the leist, tofor thi wayfleyng,
  Had I a child consavyt of thyne ofspryng,
  Gif I had ony ȝong Eneas small,
  Befor me forto play within my hall,
  Quhilk representit by symylitude thi face;                           5
  Than semyt I nocht, thus wys, allace! allace!
  Aluterly dissauyt nor dissolate.
    Thus said the queyn Dido, in febil estate.
  Bot, apon Jovis message fermly he
  Stude musyng so, he movit nocht ane E;                              10
  Refrenyt his will, hydand in hart his thocht,
  And, at the last, thir few wordis hes furth brocht:
  O gentil queyn, that sall I nevir deny,
  Thy gude deid and desart is mair worthy
  Than thou with wordis or tong may expreme;                          15
  Nor it sal nevir me irk, na ȝit mysseym,
  The worthy Dido to hald in fresch memory,
  So lang as that my self remembir may I,
  Or quhil the spreit of lyfe this body steris.
  As the mater requiris, a litil heris:                               20
  I purposyt nocht forto hyde thyftuusly
  My vayage, nor, as ȝe weyn, secretly
  Away to steil; quhat nedis ȝou sa to feyn?
  For I pretendit nevir, be na meyn,
  With ȝou to mak the band of mariage,                                25
  Nor in that ȝok, ne frendschip in Cartage,
  Ȝyt come I nevir: bot gif the fatis, but pled,
  At my plesour sufferit me lyfe to led,
  At my fre wil my warkis to modyfy,
  The cite of Troy than first agane suld I                            30
  Restore, and of our deir frendis remanys
  Gaddir togiddir, and to the venquist Troianys
  Raparal with my handis agane thar wallis,
  And beild vp Priamus palyce at now fallis.
  Bot sen Appollo, clepit Gryneus,                                     5

  To Itale eik oraclys of Lycia

  Thar is my lust now, and delyte at hand,
  Thar is my cuntre, and my natyve land.                              10
  Gif the, of Cartage the burgh and towris swa,
  Quhilk art a woman of Phenycia,
  And the aspect of citeis Affricane
  Delytis, and withhaldis heir to remane,
  Quhat wrang is it, caus of envy or schame,                          15
  Thocht Troianys seik to Itale for thar hame?
  Or is it nocht als lesum and ganand
  That fynaly we seik to onkouth land?
  Als oft as day is gone, and the dyrk nycht
  With hir donk schaddow hydis of the erth the sycht,                 20
  Als oft as schynyng starnys doith vprys,
  My faderis gost, Anchises, als feil sys
  Into my sleip mannasis me tharto fast,
  And oft his feirfull ymage doith me agast;
  And, in lyke wys, the child Ascanyus,                               25
  Quhais deir hed suffir iniurys is hard to ws,
  Quham of the realm of Itail I defraud,
  And fra the grond to hym promyst withhawd.
  Be athir of our hedis this I sweir;
  Now laitly eik of goddis the messynger,                             30
  From hie Jupiter in hasty message sent,
  Down throu the ayr brocht the ilk commandment:
  On fair day lycht, myne awyn self dyd I se

  And his wordis with thir sam eris hard I.                            5

  _Of the scharp wordys queyn Dydo dyd say,
  And how Eneas bownys fast away._


  Dydo, aggrevit ay quhil he his tayl tald,
  With acquart luke gan to wart hym behald,                           10
  Rollyng vmquhile hir eyn, now heir, now thar,
  With syght onstabil waverand our alquhar;
  And all enragyt thir wordis gan furth braid:
    Nothir wes a goddes thy moder, as is sayd,
  Nor ȝyt kyng Dardanus cheif stok of thi kyn,                        15
  Thou treuthles wyght; bot, of a cald hard quhyn,

  Bot of sum cruel tygir of Araby
  The pappys the fosterit in the wod Hyrcany.                         20
  To quhat effect suld I hym langar perswaid,
  Or quhat bettir may beleve than he hes said?
  Quhiddir gif he murnyt quhen we wepit and walyt?
  Quhiddir gif he steryt his eyn, as ocht hym alyt?
  Quhidder gif, for rewth, he furthȝet anys a teyr,
  Or of hys lufe had piete? na, not to ȝeir.
  Quhou sal I begyn, quhat first, quhat last to say?                   5
  Now, now, nothir gretast Juno, wallaway!
  Nor Saturnys son, hie Jupiter, with just eyn
  Hes our querrell considerit, na ourseyn;
  For no quhar now faith nor lawte is fund.
  I ressavyt hym schyp brokkyn fra the sey grund,                     10

  And hys feris fred from the deth alhaill.
  Allace! enragyt or enchantit am I;                                  15
  Quhen now Appollo, with hys sossery,
  And quhilis, he says, the kavillys of Lycia,
  And quhilis, fra Jupiter down sent alsswa,
  The messynger of goddis bryngis throu the skyis

  Lyke as the goddis abufe nocht ellys rocht,

  Forsuyth, gif reuthfull goddis may ony thing,
  Amyd thi way, I traist, on rolkis blak
  Thou sal deir by thy treuth thou to me brak,
  And clepe oft my richt name, Dido, Dido!
  With fyre infernale, in thine absens alsso,                         30

  Nor ȝyt him pray go not to Italy,

  And hys benyng eris the goddis dyttit,

  The sammyn wys was this gentil baroun,

  And in his stout breist, ful of thochtis het,
  Of reuth and amouris felt the perturbance.

  Forto behald the hevynnys firmament.
  Tharfor, in takyn hir purpos to fulfill,
  And leif the lycht of lyfe, as was hyr will,
  As on the altaris byrnand ful of sense
  The sacrifyce scho offerit, in hir presence,                        30
  A grisly thyng to tell, scho gan behald

  Nor ȝyt to An, hir deir systir, it tald.
  In wirschip eik, within hir palyce ȝet,
  Of hir first husband, was a tempil bet
  Of marbill, and hald in ful gret reverens,
  With snaw quhite bendis, carpettis, and ensens,                     10
  And festuale burgeonys arrayt, on thar gys:
  Tharin was hard vocis, spech, and cryis
  Of hir said spous, clepand hir ful lowd,
  Evir quhen the dyrk nycht dyd the erth schrowd;
  And oft with wild scryke the nycht owle,                            15
  Heich on the rufe, alane, was hard ȝowle
  With langsum voce and a ful petuus beir.
  And eik bygane the feirful sawis seyr
  Of the dyvynys, with terribil monysyngis,
  Affrayt hir by mony grysly syngis.                                  20
  And in hir sleip, wod wroth, in euery place
  Hir semyt cruel Eneas gan hir chace;
  And evir, hir thocht, scho was left al alane,
  And, but cumpany, mony far way had gane,
  To seik hir folkis in a wilsum land.                                25
  Lyke kyng Pentheus, in his wod rage dotand,
  Thocht he beheld gret rowtis stand in staill
  Of the Ewmenydes, fureys infernale,
  And in the lyft twa sonnys schynand cleir;
  The cite of Thebes gan dowbil to hym appeir:                        30
  Or lyke Orestes, son of Agamenon,
  On theatreis, in farcis mony one,
  Rowpyt and sung how he his moder fled,
  With fyre brondis and blak serpentis ourcled,
  And saw the furyis, and grisly goddis fed,                           5
  Sittand in the tempill port to wrek hir ded.

  And fellon stormys of ire gan hir to schaik

  For amang kynd folkis this is na dreid,

  Sal I thame cach agane our seys lycht?

  And, al forvayit, takis nothir cuyr nor keyp
  For to behald quhat perrellys about the standis,                    15

  _Heir followis of the famus queyn Dydo
  The fatale dynt of deth and mortale wo._

  With chekis freklyt, and al of tythirris bysprent,                   5
  Quakyng throu dreid, ruschit furth, or scho wald stent,
  Onto the innar wardis of hyr place,

  And sone as sche beheld Eneas clething,
  And eik the bed bekend, a quhile wepyng,

  So lang as God lyst suffir and destane,
  Ressaue my blude, and this sawle that on flocht is,
  And me delyvir from thir hevy thochtis.
  Thus lang I levyt haue, and now is spent
  The term of lyfe that forton heth me lent;                          20
  For now my gret gost vndir erth mon go.

  And, with that word, rave hir self to the hart.                     10
  Now lat ȝon cruel Troiane swelly and se

  _Ene fra Cartage salys, and quhon belyve
  He with the tempest was in Sycill dryve._


  In the meyn quhile tho gan Eneas hald

  Hys navy with north wynd scherand the seys:
  Towart Cartage he gan behald, and seys

  Of the onhappy Dydoys funeral fyre.
  Quha had this gret fyre maid, and to quhat end,

  Bot by the sorofull takynyng, not the les,
  The Troianys in thar breistis tuke a ges                            10
  Quharfor it was; for weil wyst Eneas
  In violait lufe quhat strenth of dolour was,
  And knew alsso quhat thyngis mycht be controvyt
  By women in fury rage that strangly luffyt.
    Bot fra the schippys held the deyp see,                           15
  That now na mair sycht of the land thai se,
  Salve hevyn abufe, and fludis all about,
  A watry clowd, blak and dyrk, but dout,
  Gan our thar hedis tho appeir ful rycht,
  And down a tempest sent als dyrk as nycht;
  The streym wolx vgsum of the dym sky.                                5
  Palynurus, the maistir, gave a cry
  From the eft castell heich, thar as he stude;
  Quharfor, allace! samony clowdis onrude,
  Quod he, bylappyt hes the hevynnys, lo?

  This beyng said, commandis he euery feir
  Do red thar takillis, and stand hard by thar geir,
  And wightly als thar arys vp to haile:
  Hymself infangis the le schete of the saill,
  And eftir said; maist curageus Ene,                                 15
  Althocht our helpar, gret Jove, wald hecht it me,

  The wynd is contrar, brayand in our bak saill,
  Hard in our berd vpblawand wondir fayr,
  And al with bubbys ombesett is the ayr;                             20
  Nor we may nocht stryve nor infors sa fast

  Consavyt hym and bayr, as it is said.

  Of thar return was he, and myrrely                                  25

  Gave thame of rural metis with glaid semlance,
  And cherysyt thame with frendly purvyance.

  Hald to the crag agane, Meneyt, fast by.
  And tharwith, lo! Cloanthus he dyd behald

  For, rycht betwix the rolk and Gyas schyp,

  And wan befor the formast schip in hy:

  The ancyant treuth of Meneyt forȝettis he,                           5
  And swakkyt hym our schipburd in the see:
  Hym self, as skyppar, hynt the steir in hand,
  Hym self, as mastir, gan maryneris command,
  And threw the ruddyr to the costis syde.
  Be than the auld Meneyt our schipburd slyde,                        10

  And, hym behaldand swym, thai keklyt all;

  Now, now, ȝe vailliant feris of worthy Hector,
  Hail stoutly vp ȝour arys; thynk on ȝour glor;

  Quhamto Neptune lyst grant at hys devyce;

  Quhil in thar dry throtis the aynd worth skant,
  And swait down triglys in stremys our alquhar.
    Betyd a chance that ilk tyme fell thame fair,
  And grantyt thame that honour tha desyryt:
  For as Sergest, with fers mynde half enfyryt,                       30
  Turnyt hys stevyn towart the rolk our neir,
  Ontil a wykkyt place hys schip dyd steir,

CAP. VI.

  _Into this nixt cheptour followys heir
  The fut mennys rynkis and rewardis seir._


  Gentyll Ene, this sport endyt and done,
  Ontyl a fayr plane greyn passyt sone,
  Quhilk was enveronyt al with hyllys hie,
  Schaddowyt with woddys rank, and mony a tre:
  Amyd the vale, in maner of cyrkyl rownd,                            15
  A playng place was markyt on the grond,
  Syk as that clepyt beyn a theatry.
  Thiddir the heir with mony thousand gan hy,
  And evyn amydwart in hys troyn grete,
  For hym arayt, takyn hes hys sete:                                  20
  Quhar, with rewardis seir, he dyd provoke
  The curage and myndis of ȝong foke;
  Syk as lykkyt swyftly on fute to ryn,
  Cum bayr the pryce away, and wageour wyn.
  On athir half than gadderis hym about
  Of Troianys sammyn and Sycilyanys a rowt;
  And first come Nysus and the fresch Evrille:                         5
  Ewrillyus in grene ȝouth and luf sylle,
  Maist eligant of person, for quhays frendschip
  And tendyrnes come Nisus in falloschip:
  Quham followis nixt nobyl Dyores the gude,

  And eftir hym thar followys sone onon
  Twa othirris sammyn, Salyus and Patron,
  Of quham the tane born of Epyria,
  And the tother was of Archadya,
  Cummyn of the blude of Tegea that cite:                             15
  Twa othir ȝong men syne of Sycille,

  Hantyt to ryn in woddis and in schawis:
  Seir othir come eik, quhais namys onknaw is,                        20
  For that thai war of law stait and degre.
    Amyddys of thame all, thus sayd Ene;
  Tak tent frendis, remembir quhat I say,
  Mark this in myndis glaidly, and bair away:
  Neuer ane of al this falloschip, quod he,                           25

  For ȝou al equale salbe syk presand.                                30

  Thar hedis crownyt with greyn olyve tre:
  Quha cummys fyrst, and victour our the laif,
  Ane hors with precyus harnessyng sal haif:
  The secund, ane arow cays of Amazon,                                 5
  Ful of arrowys of Trace, sal haue onon,
  Hungyn by a braid tysche of gold ilke joynt,
  The bukkil claspyt with a jemmys poynt:
  The thryd most go hys way, and stand content
  Bot of this Gregion helm, lo, heir present.                         10
    Quhen this was said, thar placis haue thai tane,
  And, fra thai hard the takyn, sone onane
  Richt swyftly on thar rasys gan thai tak;
  The stand thai leif, and flaw furth with a crak,
  As wyndis blast, etland to the rynkis end.                          15
  Befor thame all furth bowtis with a bend
  Nysus a far way, start mair spedely
  Than thud of weddir, or thundyr in the sky.
  Nyxt onto hym, bot nocht neir be far way,
  Followys Salyus; and, a space eftir thame tway,                     20
  Ewrialus was the thryd: quham syne infeir
  Followyt Helymus; quhamto held evir neir
  Dyores, quhidderand at hys bak fute hait,
  Hys tays choppand on hys heill al the gayt,
  Writhand with hys schuldir to haue thrung hym by;                   25
  And, had he anys won mair rowm, tho in hy
  He suld ful sone haue skyppyt furth befor,
  And left in dowt quha come fyrst to the skoyr.
    Be this thai wan neir to the rynkis end,
  Irkyt sum deill befor the mark weil kend;                           30
  Quhen that Nysus fallys, onhappely,
  Apon the glotnyt blude, quhar as fast by
  The styrkis for the sacrifyce, per cace,
  War newly brytnyt; quharof al the place,
  And the greyn gers, bedyit was and wet.                              5
  As this ȝongker heiron tred and fute set,
  Joly and blyth, wenyng hym victour round.
  He slaid and stumryt on the slydry grond,
  And fell at erd gruflyngis amyd the fen,
  Or beistis blude of sacrifyce; ȝyt then                             10
  Forȝettis he not Ewrialus luf, perfay,
  Bot kest hym evyn ourthourtyr Salyus way,
  Grulyng as he mycht apon the slydry grene,
  Maid hym lycht wyndflaucht on the grond onclene.
  Furth sprent Ewrialus formest, and, by supple                       15
  Of his frend Nysus, the first place wan he.
  With rerd and favorabil hailsyngis furth he sprang,
  As oft befallys, syk tymys, commonys amang.
  Helymus nixt onto the stand is cummyn:
  The thryd place now and gre Dyor has nummyn.                        20
  Tho Salyus fyllys al the court about
  With lowd ramingis, and with mony a schowt,
  And gan, in presens of the nobillys, pray
  Restor hys honour by dyssayt stollyn away.
  The favour defendis Eurialus of hys ferys,                          25
  And of hys eyn brysting the seymly terys,
  Sched for dysdeyn he suld swa leys hys pryce;
  The vertew, eyk, mair gracyus at all devyce
  Was haldyn, at come of sa seymly person.
  That helpyt mekyl; and Dyores evir onon                             30
  Chydis for hym fast, for alsmekill as he
  The thryd place than had wonnyn and the gre;
  Bot all for nocht may he the last pryce beleif,
  Gyf that to Salyus the fyrst reward beys geyf.
    Than the rewthfull Eneas spak and sayd:                            5
  Ȝour enterprys, childeryng, beys blyth and glaid,
  Remanys sovir to ȝou; for, owt of weir,
  As fyrst was set the pryce, sal na man steir.
  It moste be to me leful rewth to haue
  Of my frendis myschance, hys lak to save,                           10
  Quhilk in hys awyn defalt tynt not the gre.
  And, sayand thus, to Salyus gave he
  A bustuus lyonys skyn of Getuly,
  With goldyn clewys, lokkerit and weghty.
  Ha! than quod Nysus, gyf syk reward salbe                           15
  Gevyn onto thame at fallys and tynys the gre:
  Gif the lyst rew on syk, quhat gyft condyng
  Wilt thou geif Nysus, ran swyft in a lyng,
  And worthy was the fyrst croun to haue caucht,
  War nocht the sam mysforton me ourraucht                            20
  Quhilk Salyus betyd? and, with that word,
  Hys face he schew besmottyrit for a bourd,
  And al hys membris in mud and dung bedoyf.
  Than lewch that ryal prynce on hym to goyf,
  And bad do fech a rych scheild, wrocht quently                      25

  And by the Grekis alsso doun was dyng
  Of Neptunys tempyll post, quhar it dyd hyng:
  This worthy ȝong man with that gyft soverane
  Rewardis he, of syk geyr as mycht gane.                             30




CAP. VII.

  _Of the twa kempys suld stryfe in the pres,
  The bustuus Entellus and Darhes._


  Eftyr thir rasys done, and gyftys geif;
  Now cummys heir, said Ene, quha lyst preif
  To streke thar armys furth, and heys on hycht,
  For mays or burdon arrayit weil at rycht:
  Quha hes tharto reddy bald spreit lat se.                            5
  For athir party the pryce ordanyt hes he:
  For the victour a bul, and al hys hed
  Of goldyn schakaris and roys garlandis red
  Buskyt full weil; to hym venquyst, alssua,
  A rych helm and a fyne sword, baith twa,                            10
  Set for hys solace. Than, but delay, Darhes
  With buustuus fors schew hys face in the pres.
  As he vpstart, onon gret rumour rays
  Amang the commonys, sayand, lo! quhar he gays,
  Alane was wont agane Parys debait:                                  15
  Ȝon sam is he quhilk, at the tumbe, fute hait,
  Quhar beryit was Hector of maist renoun,
  The campion Butes ourcom and bet doun,
  Al flat hym speldyt on the dun sand,
  In the dedthrawis: quhilk Butes, to vnderstand,                     20
  Fra Bebrycy com, of statur huge rude,
  And hym avansyt of kyng Amycus blude.
  Thys ilk Darhes, berand hys hed on hie,

  Ane othir mache to hym was socht and speryt;
  Bot thar was nane of al the rowt at steryt,
  Ne durst presume meyt that man on the land,                          5
  With mace nor burdon to debait hand for hand.
  Joly and glaid tharof, baith al and sum
  Into bargane wenyng fortil ourcum,
  Beforn Eneas feyt stad but delay:
  The bul he grippys by ane of hornys tway                            10
  With hys left hand, and said apon this wys;
  Son of the goddes, gyf na man wil rys,
  Ne dar hym self aventur in batelle,
  Quhy stand I thus? quhou lang efferis me dwell?
  Command me leid away the pryce al fre.                              15
  The Troianys with hym sammyn, he and he,
  Murmuryt and bemyt on the ilke wys:
  Reyk to the man the pryce promyst, all cryis.
    Tho gan the grave Acest with wordis chyde
  Entellus, sat on greyn sonk hym besyde:                             20
  Entell, quod he, vmquhile the forcyast
  Of campionys clepyt, and the worthyast,
  Invane that name thou beris, I dar say,
  Gyf thou, sa thoilmude, sufferis leid away
  So gret a pryce, but dereyn of batell.                              25
  Quhar is he now, gret Erix, as thai tell,
  Our God renownyt, and mastir, al for nocht?
  Quhar now that fame, our al Sycil onflocht
  Quhilum dywlgate, is becummyn and gone?
  Quhar beyn the spulȝe triumphal mony one,                           30
  Within thine hows hyngis on euery post?
    The tother ansuerd: nowthir for dreid ne bost
  The luf of wirschip nor honour went away is,
  Bot certanly the dasyt blude, now on days,

  The cald body hes mynyst my curage:
  Bot war I now, as vmquhile it hes bene,

  Ȝa, had I now syk ȝouthed, traistis me,
  But ony pryce, I suld al reddy be;                                  10
  Na lusty bull me tyl induce suld neid,
  For nothir I suld haue cravyt wage nor meyd.
    Quhen this was said, he hes, but mair abaid,
  Twa kempys burdonys brocht, and befor thame laid,
  With al thar harnes and braseris by and by,                         15
  Of weght ful huge, and schap onmesurly;
  Quhar with, vmquhile, the stern Erix was wont
  To feght in bargane, and geif mony dont,
  In that hard bellan hys brawnys to enbrace.
  All wolx estonyst beheld thame in that place:                       20
  So huge weght, and so gret quantite
  Thai war, that weil thame semyt for to be
  Of curbulle corvyn sevyn gret oxin hydis,
  Styf as a burd that stude, on athir sydis
  Stuffyt and cowchit ful of irne and leid.                           25
  Abuf al otheris, Darhes, in that sted,
  Thame to behald abasyt wolx grettumly,
  Tharwith to mel reffusyng aluterly:
  Bot, ful of magnanymyte, Eneas
  Pasys thar weght als lychtly as a fas,                              30
  Thar hydduus braseris swakand to and fro.
    Syk wordis gan the auld rehersyng tho:
  Quhat wald he haue said, that perchance had se

  And on this ilke cost the sorofull bargane?                          5
  Thir sammyn wapynnys Erix, thi broder germane,
  Was wont to bair: behald thame smottyt quyte
  Of his red blude, and harnys tharon owtsmyte.
  With thir agane gret Hercules stude he;
  With thir was I wont mach in the melle,                             10
  Quhil my fresch blude mair fors and strenth me lent,
  Or that onfrendlich eild had thus bysprent
  My hed and halffettis baith with canus hair.
  Bot, gyf that Troiane Darhes reffusys thair
  With thir, our cuntre wapynnys, in feild to pas,                    15
  And eik it lykis the curtas Eneas,
  So that Acest my soverane that appreve,
  Be not efferd, Darhes; na thing the greve;
  Erix macis to the on syde lay I,
  And thou thi Troiane burdon alsso do by:                            20
  With equale wapynnys lat ws go to sone.
  And, with that word, of hys schulderis hes done
  Hys dowbill habyt; and hys lymmys squair,
  Baith byg bonys and brawnys, maid al bair;
  Syne stythly in the sand vpstandis he,                              25
  Of hyduus statur and of quantite.




CAP. VIII.

  _The bargane of the kempys curageus,
  The fers Darhes, and stalwart Entellus._


  The prynce Anchises son, Eneas, than
  Twa evynly burdonys walyt, as cunnand man,
  And equale armour, but dyversyte,
  On schulderis and thar gardeys buklys he.
  Than athir gan contrar othir styth stand,                            5
  With fyngeris fast faikand thar mace in hand,

  Onabasytly rasyt thar armys squair,
  And from the straik thar nek drew far abak.
  Now, hand to hand, the dynt lychtis with a swak;                    10
  Now bendis he vp hys burdon with a mynt,
  On syde he bradis fortil eschew the dynt;

  He metis hym thar, and charris hym with a chak;
  He watis to spy, and smytis in al hys mycht,                        15
  The tother keppys hym on hys burdon wycht;

  Lychtar on fute and agil was the tane,
  And in hys lusty ȝouth sum deil ensuris:

  Bot hys faynt schankis gan for eild schaik;
  Hys gowsty cost and membris, euery straik,
  The febil braith gan to bete and blaw.
  Thir hardy kempys, al in waist, leyt draw,

  On holl sydis feill dowbill dyntis gan bete,
  And on thar breistis lychtis with huge sownd;
  Oft in the ayr about thar hedis rownd
  Thar handis waveryt, and the strayk went mys;                        5
  Hard halffettis clappyt oft vndir the dynt, I wys.
  Entellus standis styf and grave of cors,
  Not movyng from hys fyrst stand in a fors,
  And, with hys body only, and walkryfe E,

  Bot Darhes walkis about rycht craftely,
  Of hys fyrst purpos frustrat, to espy

  Hym ombesetting sair, and handland hait:
  Lyke as by gret engynys quha sa wald                                15

  To wyn that strenth, or ȝyt by craftis sle

  Quhar best he may cum to hys purpos sone,
  Avysand weil the place maist oportone.
  Entellus raxit hym, and hevis on hycht
  Hys rycht hand, for to smyte in al hys mycht:
  The tother, seand the dynt cum, gan provide                         25
  To eschew swyftly, and sone lap on syde,
  That al hys fors Entellus gan apply
  Into the ayr; so that hys grave body,
  All hym alane, with huge weght and sayr,
  Ruschyt flatlyngis to the grond with a rair:                        30
  So as, quhilum, the mekil kosch fyr tre,
  On Erymanthus the mont of Archade,
  Or in the wod of Ida, with a sownd
  Vp by the rutis rent, ruschis to grond.

  Gan starting all on fut delyvirly:
  The clamour rays, quhil al the hevyn dyd ryng,
  And fyrst to hym ran Acestes the kyng,
  And, for compassioun, hes vphynt in feild
  Hys frend Entellus, onto hym evyn eild.                             10
  Bot, nother estonyst nor abasyt heiron,
  Mair egyrly the vaillyant campion
  Agane to bargane went als hoyt as fyre:
  Hys strenthys now encressis al of ire;
  For schame, alsso, and for that weil he knew                        15
  Hys auld prowes, hys fors dowblyt and grew;
  And ardently, with fury and mekil boist,
  Gan Darhes kach and dryve our al the cost:
  Now with the rycht hand, now with the left hand, he
  Dowblys dyntis, and, but abaid, leyt fle,                           20
  That nothyr rest nor quyet may he tak.
  Als fast as rayn schour rappys on the thak,
  So thyk with strakis this campion maist strang,
  With athir hand, feil sys at Darhes dang,
  And drave hym to and fra with mony rowt.                            25

  Na langar suffer wald sik wreth procede,
  Nor fers Entellus mude thus rage and sprede;
  Bot of the bargane maid end, but delay,
  And wery Darhes hes withdrawyn away.                                30
  With wordis hym to mesyng thus he said:
  Onsylle wight, quhou dyd thi mynd invaid
  Sa gret wodnes? felys thou not ȝyt, quod he,
  Othir strenth or mannys fors hes delt with the?
  Seys thou not weil thi self at thou art fey?                         5
  Tharfor to God thou ȝeild the and obey:
  The power of goddys ar turnyt in thy contrar:
  Obey to God. And with that word, but mair,
  The bargane he dissolvyt: and than Darhes
  Hys trew companȝeonys ledis of the pres,                            10
  Harland hys wery lymmys dolf as led,

  Quhat pretendis this fellon goddes greif,
  And eik, accordyng thar fatis, quhat was releif;
  And, comfortand Eneas, thus gan say:                                15

  Eftir that all was went to rest and pace,

  Ontil Eneas heth thir wordis said:

  Quhil that I levit, than myne awin lyve;
  O son, in Troiane fatis exercit sayrly;

  And deip regioun of hell, behufis the se,
  To cum and speke with me, myne awin son deir.
  Be not agast, my child, and haue na feir:                           30
  For I am nocht withhald, I lat the wyt,
  In Tartarus, the soroful hellys pyt,

    Thus hes he said; and with that word, but mair,                   15

  And quhen Eneas saw him pas, he said,
  Quhidder bradis thou now sa fast, without abaid?
  Quhidder hastis thou swa? quhom fleys thou? me, allace!
  Quhat is the let I may the nocht enbrace?                           20

  And the, al innocent, soroful slepis brocht.
  Heich in the eftschip dyd this God appeir,

  Quhen lo! this God smate bath his tymplis twane
  With a ful sleipry and bedyit grane,

  And sowpit in Stix, the forcy hellys see:                           30

  And nocht the les the schip held furth hir went,
  As scho did ayr, throw the calm seys sprent,
  But ony harm, and al the navy sone,

THE PROLOUG OF THE SAXT BUKE.


  Pluto, thou patron of the deip Achiron,
  Fader of tormentis in thyne infernal see,
  Amyd the fludis, Stix and Flagiton,
  Lethie, Cochite, the watyris of oblivie,
  With dolorus quhirling of furyus sistyris thre,                      5
  Thyne now salbe my muse and drery sang:
  To follow Virgil in this dyrk poyse
  Convoy me, Sibil, that I ga nocht wrang.

  Quhat wenys fulys this saxt buke be bot japis,
  Al ful of leys or ald ydolatryis?                                   10
  O hald ȝour pace, ȝe verray goddis apis!
  Reid, reid agane, this volume, mair than twys:
  Consider quhat hyd sentence tharin lyis:
  Be war to lak, les than ȝe knew weil quhat;
  And gif ȝou list not wirk eftir the wis,                            15
  Heich on ȝour hede set vp the foly hat.

  All is bot gaistis and elrich fantasyis,
  Of browneis and of bogillis ful this buke:
  Owt on thir wandrand speritis, wow! thou cryis;
  It semys a man war mangit, tharon list luke,                        20
  Lyke dremys or dotage in the monys cruke,
  Vayn superstitionys aganyst our richt beleve:
  Quhat of thir fureis, or Pluto that plukkit duke,
  Or cal on Sibil, deir of a revyn sleif?

  Wald thou I suld this buke to the declare,
  Quhilk war impossibil til expreme at schort?                         5
  Virgil is ful of sentence our all quhare;
  Bot heirintil, as Seruius gan proport,
  Hys hie knawlage he schawis, that euery sort
  Of his clausys comprehend sik sentence,
  Thar bene tharof, set thou think this bot sport,                    10
  Maid gret ragmentis of hie intelligence.

  In all his warkis Virgil doith discrive
  The stait of man, gif thou list vnderstand;
  Baith life and ded in thir fyrst bukis fyve;
  And now, intil this saxt, we haue on hand,                          15
  Eftir thar deth, in quhat plyte saulis sal stand.
  He writis lyke a philosophour naturall:
  Twichand our faith mony clausis he fand
  Quhilk beyn conform, or than collaterall.

  Schawis he nocht heir the synnys capital?                           20
  Schawis he nocht wikkit folk in endles pane?
  And purgatory for synnys venyall,
  And vertuus pepil into the plesand plane?
  Ar al sik sawis fantasy and invane?
  He schawis the way, evir patent, down to hell,                      25
  And rycht difficil the gait to hevin agane,
  With ma gude wordis than thou or I kan tell.

  Heir tretand vertu, taxis he pane for vyce,
  Feil woful turmentis of wrachit catyvis sary,
  Notabil histories, and diuers proverbis wyce,
  Quhilkis to rehers war our prolixt a tary:
  Althocht he, as a gentile, sum tyme vary,                            5
  Ful perfitely he writis seir misteris fell,
  As quhou thir heithin childir thar werdis wary,
  Wepand and waland at the first port of hell.

  And, thocht our faith neid nane authorising
  Of gentiles bukis, nor by sik heithin sparkis,                      10
  ȝit Virgil writis mony just claus conding,
  Strenthing our beleve, to confound payan warkis.
  Quhou oft rehersis Austyne, cheif of clarkis,
  In his gret volume of the cite of God,
  Hundreth versis of Virgil, quhilk he markis                         15
  Agane Romanys, til vertu thame to brod!

  And of this saxt buke walis he mony a scor,
  Not but gude resson; for, thocht Criste grund our faith,
  Virgil sawis ar worth to put in stor.
  Thay aucht not be hald vagabund nor waith,                          20
  Ful riche tresour thai bene and precius graith:
  For oft by Sibilys sawis he tonys his stevyn;
  Thus faithfully in his Bucolykis he saith,
  The maide cummyth bringis new lynnage fra hevyn.

  As twiching hym writis Ascentyus;                                   25
  Feil of his wordis bene like the appostilis sawis,
  He is ane hie theolog sentencyus,
  And maste profound philosophour he him schawis,
  Thocht sum his writis frawart our faith part drawis:
  Na wondir; he was na cristyn man, per De,
  He was a gentile, and levit on payane lawis,
  And ȝit he puttis a God Fader maste hie.                             5

  We trow a God, regnand in personys thre,
  And ȝit angellis hevinly spiretis we call;
  And of the hevinly wightis oft carpis he,
  Thocht he belevit thai war not angellis all.
  Quhil Cristis passioun, of Adam from the fall,                      10
  All went to hell, thocht all war nocht in pane:
  Or Criste he wrait this buke, quhar reid ȝe sall
  Destinit in hell specialy placis twane.

  And principaly the sted of fell tormentis,
  With seyr departingis in that laithly hald;                         15
  Ane other place quhilk purgator representis,
  And, dar I say, the _Lymbe_ of faderis ald,
  With _Lymbus puerorum_, as I haue tald.
  Schawis he not eik, by werkis meritory,
  Quhou just pepil, in welthis monyfald,                              20
  Raiosys, syngand sangis of hevinly glory?

  And, as he twichis greys seyr in payn,
  In blys, elike wys, syndry slagis puttis he.
  Quhat sal I of his wondir warkis sayn?
  For al the plesance of the camp Elyse,                              25
  Octauian, in his Georgikis, ȝe may se:
  He consalis nevir lordschip in hell desyre,
  Bot evir in hevin, intil sum hie degre,
  To cheys his place, and not amang the fyre.

  Quhat cristyn clerk kouth hym haue consalit bettir?
  Al thocht he was neuer catholyk wight,
  He hes writtin ful mony attentik lettir.                             5
  In that ilk buke he techis ws ful richt,
  The warld begouth in veyr, baith day and nycht;
  In veir he says that God als formyt man,
  The son, the mone, and all the starnys bright:
  We grant in veir that first the warld began.                        10

  Happy war he knew the caus of al thingis,
  And settis on syde all dreid and cuyr, quod he,
  Vndir his feyt at treddis, and down thryngis,
  Chancis ontretabill of fatis and destane,
  All feir of ded, and eik of hellis see;                             15
  Happy he callys sik wightis, and sa do I:
  Quhar may we swa optene felicite?
  Neuer bot in hevin empire abone the sky.

  Tyll write you all hys tryit and notabil vers
  Almaist impossibil war, and half invane,                            20
  For me behuffyt repeting and rehers
  In seir placis the sammyn wordis agane.
  This may suffice, I wil no mor sane:
  Ane movar, ane begynnar puttis he,
  Sustenys all thing, and doyth in all remane;                        25
  And, be our faith, the sammyn thing grant we.

  I say nocht all hys warkis beyn perfyte,
  Nor that sawlys turnys in othir bodeys agane;
  Thocht we traste, and may preif be haly write,
  Our sawle and body sal anys togiddir remane.
  At thar bene mony Goddis I will not sane,                            5
  Thocht haly scriptur just men, Goddis, clepe.
  Quhom call I Pluto, and Sibilla Cumane,
  Hark; for I wil na fals Goddis wirschepe.

  Sibilla, til interpret propirly,
  Is clepit a maid of Goddis secret preve,                            10
  That hes the spiret divyne of prophecy.
  Quha bettir may Sibilla callit be
  Than may the gloryus moder and madyn fre,
  Quhilk of hir natur consavit Criste, and buyr
  All hail the mysteris of the Trinite,                               15
  And maist excellent wark had vnder cure.

  Thou art our Sibill, Cristis moder deir,
  Prechit by prophetis and Sibilla Cumane;
  Thou brocht the hevynly lynage in erd heir,
  Moder of God, ay virgyne doith remane,                              20
  Restoring ws the goldin warld agane.
  Sathan the clepe I, Pluto infernall,
  Prynce in that dolorus den of wo and pane,
  Nocht God tharof, bot gretast wrech of all.

  To name the God, that war a manifest le;                            25
  Is bot a God, maker of euery thing:
  I fauour nocht the errour of Manache.
  Set thou to Wlcane haue ful gret resembling,
  And art sum tyme the minister of thundring,
  Or sum blynd Ciclopes of thy laithly wra,
  Thou art bot Jovys smytht, in the fyre blawing,
  And dyrk fornace of perpetuall Ethna.                                5

  Thou wrocht na thyng, bot maid thi self a devill,
  And that was not to mak, bot rather failȝe:
  For Austyn says, syn, myscheif, or evill,
  Is nocht at all: for quhy? thai nocht availȝe.
  The dym dongeoun of Ditis till assailȝe,                            10
  Or in the lyknes this mysty poetry,
  Help me, Mare; for certis, vail que vailȝe,
  War at Pluto, I sal hym hunt of sty.

CAP. I.

  _Ene aspyis Dedalus wark expres,
  And with Sibilla spak, the prophetes._


  Qwil on this wys ilk man occupyit was,
  Reuthful Eneas bownys hym to pas,
  Onone to sers the strenth and tempil tho
  Dedicat ontil the myghty Apollo;
  That feirfull gowsty cave far from the way,                          5
  And secret hald of Sibilla the may;
  Quhais hait memor and resson oft infyrit

  That scho the secretis fortocum did knaw.
  With this thai entrit in the hallowit schaw                         10
  Of the thrynfald passynger Dyane,
  And hows of brycht Apollo gold bigane.
    The fame is so, that Dedalus, the wright,
  Furth of king Mynos realm takand his flycht,
  Sa bald was with swift fedrame, and happy                           15
  To aventur hym self heich in the sky,
  And by a quent onvsyt way to knaw,

  Bot, at the last, softly he gan alicht
  Of Chalcydonys apon the castell hicht;
  And rendrit fyrst into thir landis, he                               5
  Offerit and hallowit, Phebus, onto the,
  The fard and flycht of baith hys weyngis two,
  And thar grathit a fair tempil alsso.
  Apon the portis dyd he carve and grave
  Androgyus slauchtir, falsly brocht to grave,                        10
  And for hys deth the vengeance and the wrake;
  Quhou of Athenes commandit war, alake!

  The kingis cite thar hecht Gnosya;
  Quharin he porturit als ful, wallowa!                               20

  The monstruus Mynotawr, doith thar remane,
  Ane horribill takin of schrewit Venus wark.                         25
  Thar was alsso craftely schape and mark

  Ful of wrynkkillit onreturnabil dissait.
  Bot, netheles, Dedalus, cawcht piete
  Of the gret luf of fayr Ariadne,                                    30
  That was the kyngis douchtir, tawght ful rycht
  Of this quent hows fortil omdo the slycht;
  Quhou by a threid the subtell wentis ilkane

  And thou alsso, the ȝong child Icharus,                              5
  Quhilk son was onto this ilk Dedalus,
  A gret part of this wark suld haue beyn thyne,

  In gold to grave thi fall twys etlyt he,                            10
  And twys, for rewth, failȝeis the faderis handis.

  This sculptur al espyit had on breid,
  Ne war Achates, quhilk befor him ȝeid,
  Be than returnyt was, and with him brocht                           15
  The religyus woman quham thai socht,

  Quhilk to the king sone spak apon this wys:
  This tyme, quod scho, to stair and to devys,                        20
  Govand on figuris, is not necessary.
  Mair neidfull now it war, but langar tary,
  Sevin ȝong stottis, that ȝok bur nevir nane,
  Brocht from the bow, in offerand brittin ilkane,
  And alsmony twyntyrris, as is the gys,                              25
  Chosyn and ganand for the sacrifys.
    On this wys till Eneas spak Sibill;
  And Troianys tareis nocht forto fulfill
  Hir commandment, that, but langar delay,
  The sacryfyis and offerand done haue thai;                          30
  And syne the nun to the hie tempill thame brocht,
  Quhilk in maner of ane gret cave was wrocht,
  Of Cuma holkit in the hillis side.
  Ane hundreth entreis had it, large and wyde;
  Ane hundreth durris tharon stekit clos,                              5
  Out at the quhilkis ruschit alsmony a voce,
  Gevand respons onto this Sibilla.
  Tho to the dur threswald cummyn ar tha,
  Quhen that this virgyn said: To ask answeris
  Now is the tyme; lo, lo, the God me steris!                         10
  And as scho gan sik wordis say and cry,
  Without the entre standand, suddanly
  Nowdir vissage nor cullour, as thai war air,
  Remanys than, nor hir weil dressit hair;
  Bot fast hir breist the breth dyd clap and bete;                    15
  Hir fers hart boldynnys vp ful grete,

  For, with the goddis maieste and myght                              20

  Hir hart pipis gan to flekkir and steir.
  Blyn nocht, blyn nocht, thou gret Troiane Ene,
  Of thi bedis nor thi prayeris, quod sche;
  For, bot thou do, thir gret durris, but dreid,                      25
  And grisly ȝettis, sal nevir warp on breid.
  And, with that word, scho cessit, and no mor said.
  The cald dreid gan the Troianys invaid,
  Thirland throu owt hard banys at euery part:
  The king hym self than inkirly from his hart                        30
  Maid this oryson, and devotly said:
    O bright Phebus, that evir reuth has had

  Thow quhilk direkkit the Troiane dartis so

  Lesum it is to desist of ȝour fede,
  And now to spair the puyr pepil Troiane.

  That cachit bene our mony see and sand,
  Quhar sal thar resting place be to remane.
  So eftir that to Phebus, and Diane,
  Of sownd marbill tempillis beld may I,
  And festual days for Appollo gar cry.                               30
  To the, alsso, within our realmys, salbe

  Quharin thi warkis and fatale destaneis,

  And, O thou blissit woman, onto the

  So that thou write nocht on the levis thi wordis,
  For dreid al turn bot til a mok or bourdis,                         10
  Gif that the wynd thame skattir and blaw away.
  Pronunce it with thyne awin mowth, I the pray.
    Tharwith he held hys pace, and said no mor.
  Bot than Sibill the prophetes, ful ȝor

  _Of Mysenus entyrment at was slane,

  The prophetes thame tald was done to de,
  Or quhat corps was this scho thame bad bery.
  And, as thai come apon the strandis dry,

  That, with his sovnd and weirly blastis, oft sys

  Sum tyme he was ane of gret Hectoris feris;
  About Hector evir hantit he the werys,
  Now blawing with his trump maste craftely,                           5

  Or he was war, him hyntis, and dyd smyte

  And in the salt wallys the man gan drown.

  With loome in hand fast wirkand lyke the laif;
  And in hys breste gan to and fra consaif,

  Sen lo, al thing the prophetes exprest

  Skars war thir wordis said, quhen, in that place,
  A payr of dowis fra hevin come with a flycht,
  And richt forgane the mannys face dyd lycht,
  And on the grene sward thar place tuke law.
  This rial prynce, alssone as he thame saw,                          20
  His moderis byrdis knew, and blithly than

  Quhar as that rych branch the grond ourheildis.
  And ȝe, my blissit moder, that our beild is

  I ȝou beseik be favorabil to our way.                               30
  And prayand thus, efter the spamen werd,

  Behaldand redly quhat syngnys thai schaw,

CAP. V.

  _Tyll hellys fludys Ene socht neddyrmar,
  And Palynurus, hys sterysman, fand thar._


  Fra thyne, strekis the way profond onone
  Deip onto hellys flude of Acheron;
  With holl bysme, and hydduus swelch onrude,
  Drumly of mud, and skaldand as it war wod,
  Popland and bulrand furth on athir hand                              5
  Onto Cochitus all his slyke and sand.
  Thir ryveris and thir watyris kepit war
  By ane Charon, a grisly ferryar,
  Terribil of schap, and sluggart of array:
  Apon his chyn feil cannos harys gray,                               10
  Lyart feltrat tatis; with burnand eyn red,
  Lyk twa fyre blesys fixit in his hed;
  Hys smottrit habyt, owr his schulderis lydder,
  Hang pevagely knyt with a knot togiddir.
  Hymself the cobill dyd with hys bolm furth schow,                   15
  And, quhen hym lyst, halit vp salys fow.
  This ald hasart careis owr fludis hoyt

  All thocht he eildit was, or step in age,
  Als fery and als swippir as a page;                                 20
  For in a god the age is fresch and greyn,
  Infatigabill and immortall as thai meyn.
    Thiddir to the bra swarmyt all the rowt
  Of ded gostis, and stud the bank abowt;
  Baith matronys, and thar husbandis, all yferis,
  Ryal pryncis, and nobill chevaleris,
  Smal childering, and ȝong damysellis onwed,
  And fair springaldis laitly ded in bed,
  In fader and moderis presence laid on beir.                          5
  Als gret number thiddir thikkit infeir,
  As, in the first frost eftir hervist tyde,
  Levis of treys in the wod doys slyde;
  Or byrdis flokkis owr the fludis gray,
  Onto the land seikand the nerrest way,                              10
  Quhom the cald sesson cachis owr the see,
  Into sum benar realm and warm cuntre.
  Thar stude thai prayand sum support to get,
  That thai mycht with the formast owr be set,
  And gan vp heving petuusly handis twa,                              15
  Langand to be apon the forthir bra.
  Bot this soroful boytman, with brym luyk,
  Now thir, now thame, within his veschel tuke;
  And other sum expellit, and maid do stand
  Far from the ryvage syde apon the sand.                             20
    Awondrit of this sterage, and the pres,
  Say me, virgyn, quod Ene, or thou ces,
  Quhat menys sik confluence at this watir side?
  Quhat wald thir sawlys? quhy nyl thai nocht byde?
  Quhilk causis beyn, or quhat diuersite,                             25
  Sum from the brays thame withdraw I se;
  Ane other sort, eik, of thir sawlys ded
  Rollyt owr this ryver, cullorit as the led?
    Thys ancyant religius woman than,
  But mair delay, to answer thus began:                               30
  Anchises get, heynd child, curtas and gude,
  Discend ondowtabil of the Goddis blude,
  The deip stank of Cochitus doith thou se,
  And eik the hellis puyll, hait Stix, quod sche,
  Be quhais myghtis the Goddis ar full laith,                          5
  And dredis sair, to sweir, syne fals thar aith.
  All thir, thou seis stoppit at the schor,
  Beyn helples folk, onerdit and forlor;
  Ȝon grysly ferryar to name Charon hait;

  It is not to him lefull, he ne may
  Thame ferry owr thir rowtand fludis gray,
  Nor to the hydduus ȝonder costys haue,
  Quhil thar banys be laid to rest in graue.
  Quha ar onbereit ane hundreth ȝer mon bide,                         15
  Waverand and wandrand by this bankis syde:
  Than, at the last, to pas owr in this boyt
  Thai beyn admyt, and costis thame not a grote,
  And frely may behaldyn or espy

    Anchises son tho styntis a litil stownd,
  And baith his futsteppis fixit in the grond,
  Musyng in mynd sum deil, sad in a part,
  And of this hard forton kauth rewth in hart.
  Thar saw he, dolorus and wofull of cheir,                           25
  But funeral seruyce, nevir laid on beir,
  Lucaspes and Orontes, baith twane,
  Quhilum masteris of the schyp Lyciane;
  Quham baith yfeir, as said befor haue we,
  Saland from Troy throw owt the wally see,                           30
  The dedly storm ourquhelmyt with a quiddir,
  Baith men and schip welt vnder flude togyddir.
    Lo! Palynurus eyk, his sterysman,
  Amang otheris fast to the watir ran,
  Quhilk laitly saland in the Libyane see,                             5
  As that he gan behald the starnys hie,
  Togidder with the helmstok, quhar he stude,
  Owr schipburd swakkit was amyd the flude.
  And skarsly as Ene gan hym espy,
  Amang dirk skowgis standand full drery,                             10
  First he him gretis, sayand to him thus;
  Quhilk of the goddis, O Palynurus,
  The ws bereft, and drynt amyd the see?
  Quhow tyd that cace? declar me, I pray the.
  For certis, bricht Apollo nevir or now                              15

  Of hys answer twiching the he ravyt,
  And hes my mynd tharin al hail dissavit;
  That schew thow suld hailskarth owr the see
  Onto the grond of Ital cum, quod he:                                20
  Se, thus his lawte and promyt is keip!
    The tother answeris with a petuus peip:
  Maist worthy Duke, Anchises son sa deir,
  Nowder hath the of Phebus the answer,
  Vndir his secrete cortyne, so dissave,                              25
  Ne ȝit na God sa far has me bywave,
  Nor drownyt in the deip, as ȝe beleve.
  Bot, as I slaid our burd to my myscheve,
  The helmstok, or gubernakil of tre,
  Quharwith I rewlit owr cours throu the see,                         30
  Lenand tharon sa fast, per cace it threw,
  And rent away owr burd with me I drew.
  The wally seys to wytnes draw I heir,
  That for my self tuke I nane sa gret feir

  Dreding scho suld haue perist in sik neid,
  Owr the huge swelland fludis rays on breid.
  The sowth wynd Nothus thre days me drave
  Throw owt the see, with violent wallys wave:                        10
  Skars on the ferd day at morn dyd I spy,
  Heich from the wallys croppis, Italy.
  Huly and fair onto the cost I swam:
  And tho almaist in surte cummyn I am;
  Ne war the crewel pepil of tha landis,                              15
  As that I grippit with my crukit handis
  The scharp rolkis toppys at the schoyr,
  In hevy wayt frog stad, and chargyt soyr,

  Wenyng a spy that I had beyn, thai said,                            20
  From thar cuntre sum pray to dryve away.
  So now I am bedyit in fludis gray,
  And wyndis warpis my corps apon the strandis.
  Quharfor I pray the, hevand vp my handis,
  And be the plesand light of hevin requiris,                         25
  And by the hailsum ayr at thou inspiris,
  And be thi weilbelovit fader dyng,
  And gude hope of thi ȝong sonnys ofspryng;
  O thou onvenquyst valyant champyoun,
  Delyuyr me fra thir gret harmys onon:                               30
  Or, at the leist, grave me in sepulture,
  Sen weil thow kan, and may perform that cur:
  Speir to the portis quhilkis Velynos hayt;
  Or gyf thar may be fundyn ony gayt,
  Quhilk thy blyssit moder hes the techit rycht,                       5
  Reke thy rycht hand onto this wrechit wight,
  And haue me with the our thir fludis red;
  So, at the leist, I may, eftir my ded,
  Into sum plesand sted remane and rest:
  For I beleve fermly thou nocht addrest                              10
  Sa large fludis, but Goddis authoryte,
  Nor Stix this layk fortil owr swym, quod he.
    Quhen that he had thir wordis said expres,
  Syk answer til hym maid the prophetes:

  Oncallyt, on the ȝondyr bra wald thou be?
  Desist, and ces to weyn with thy prayer
  The goddis decrete at thou may brek or steir.
  Bot now inprent in thy remembrance                                  25
  Thir wordys, in solace of thy hard chance.
  Quhar thy body is at this tyme present,
  For feir tharof, the pepil adiacent,
  By wondir takynnys from the hevynnys schaw,
  Constrenyt, sal bygrave thy banys law,                              30
  And on thy corps erect a sepultur,
  Doyng tharto solempnyt funeral cur:
  Palynurus to name that place for thy

    With thir wordis assuagit hys hevy thocht,                         5
  And fra hys sorofull hart, as that he mocht,
  Sum deil expellyt hes the dolorus cayr,

  Quharfor Eneas and Scybill, baith tway,
  As thai begunnyn had, held furth thar way.                          10




CAP. VI.

  _Owr Stix the flude quhou that Ene dyd fair,
  And Cerberus in cave hard ȝell and rayr._


  And as thai gan approch toward the flude,

  Alswyth as he persavit thame cum swa
  Throw the darn wod, and draw nerar the bra;
  First with sik bustuus wordis he thame grat,                        15
  And, but offence, gan thame chidyng thus plat:
  Quhat evir thou be, that cummys enarmyt so

  For quhat caus come thou hyddir? tell me tyte;
  Stand styl thar as thou art, with mekill syte.                      20
  Pres na forthir, for this is the hald richt
  Of Gaistis, Schaddowys, Sleip, and dovyrrit Nycht:
  Onlefull war, and ane forbodyn thing,

  Ne Theseus, and Pyrothous hys mayk:
  All thocht thai war cummyn of goddis lynage,
  And invynsibill of strenth and vassallage.
  For this ilk Hercules, with hys stalwart handis,
  The grym wardane of hell strenyt in bandis,                         10
  And drew hym trymlyng from the kyngis trone:
  The tothyr twa gret violence wald haue done;
  The fresch Proserpyne, Plutois lady gay,
  Furth of hir bowr begouth to led away.
    To hym agane this answer maid expres                              15
  Of Amphrisya Phebus prophetes:
  Do all suspicioun furth of thy consate;
  Heir is, quod scho, nane sik gyle nor dissate;
  Na violence owr wapynnys doith pretend:
  Weill lykis ws, it doith ws not offend,                             20
  Thocht in his cave ȝour hydduus portar

  That ay remane the chaste Proserpina

  Bot heir is cummyng, of kyng Troas ofspring,

  To vissy hys luffit fader, quhilk is ded,

  And gan approch onto the bra in heast.

  And tharwithall the byg weghty Ene
  Within his veschell boddum ressavis he.
  Vndir the paysand and the hevy charge
  Gan grane or geig full fast the sewit barge,                        20
  Sa ful of ryftys, and with lekkis perbrake,
  Scho suppit huge watir of the layk.
  Bot, at the last, owtour the flude ȝit than
  Salfly scho brocht baith prophetes and man,
  And furth thame set amyd the fowl glar,                             25
  Amang the fawch ryspys harsk and sear.

  And tho hys terribyll body with a rerd

  Of huge statur, and fellon quantite,

  Com to the plesand plane of Elyse._


  Fra that the ancyant nun of Dan Phebus
  Thir wordys endyt had, and spokkyn thus;
  Haue done, quod scho, now tak thi way expres,
  Perform thy wark quhilk thou begunnyn hes:
  Speid ws fordwart; for ȝondir, lo, I se                              5
  Of Plutois chymmys the byg wallys hie,

  Eik I behald, lo, heir forgane our face,

  Quhar our instructioun techis ws ful plane
  This presand thar to leif and goldyn grane.
    Thus said scho; and onon tharwith baith tway
  Gan walkyn furth throwout the darn way,
  And sone our passyt hes the myddill space,                          15
  Approchyng to the portis of that place.
  Eneas baldly sprang in at the ȝet,
  Hys body strynkillit, or a litill wet,
  With cleir spryngand watir ran tharby;
  Forgane thame eik, at the entre, in hy                              20
  The goldyn branch he stykkis vp far and weill.
    This beand done at last, and euery deil
  Perfurnyst langyng the goddes gyft gay,
  Ontil a plesand grond cummyn ar thai,
  With battil gyrs, fresch herbys, and beyn swardis,
  The lusty orchardis and the hailsum ȝardis
  Of happy sawlys and weil fortunat,
  To blissyt wightis the placis preparat.
  Thir feildis beyn largiar, and hevynnys brycht                       5
  Ravestis thame with purpur schynand lycht:
  The starnys, for this place conuenient,
  Knawis weil thar son and obseruys his went.
  Sum thar, amyd the gresy planys greyn,
  Into palestral plays thame betweyn                                  10
  Thar membris gan exers, and hand for hand
  Thai fal to werslyng on the goldyn sand,
  Assayand honest gemmys thame to schort:
  Sum other hantyng gan ane other sport,
  As forto dansyng, and to leid the ryng,                             15
  To syng ballatis, and go in karalyng.
  Thar was alsso the preist and menstrale sle,
  Orpheus of Trace, in syd rob harpand hie,
  Playand proportionys and spryngis dyvyne
  Apon his harp, sevyn diuers sovndis fyne;                           20
  Now with gymp fyngris doyng stryngis smyte,
  And now with subtel evyr poyntalis lyte.
  Heir was the nobil kyn and ancyant strynde,
  The maist dowchty lynage sprang be kynde
  Fra king Tewcer, campyones souerane,                                25
  Into mair happy ȝeris born ilkane:
  Thar was Ilus, and eik Assaracus,
  And the begynnar of Troy, Schir Dardanus.
    On fer Eneas and als Sibilla
  Awondrit war, and mervellis baith twa                               30
  The armour and the men for to behald,
  And voyd charyotis of thir chyftanys bald.
  Thar sperys stikkyng in the erd dyd stand;
  Wydquhar al lows owr feildis and the land
  Pasturyt thar horsis, rakand thame fast by:                          5
  For quhat plesour of armys or chevalry,
  Or quhat cuyr to addres thar cart or wedis,
  To fedyng and to dant thar sleik swail stedis,
  Thai hantit quhil thai levyt heir alyve,
  The sammyn solace, be thai man or wyfe,                             10
  Ȝit doith thame follow vndir the erth stad.
  And lo, ane other sort, ful blyth and glaid,
  On athir hand behaldis Eneas,
  At banket on the greyn herbys set was,
  In loving of the goddis joyusly                                     15
  Ympnys of pryce, triumphe, and victory,
  All syngand glaid togydder in falloschip,
  And pryncipaly Apollo to worschip:
  Within a wod of lawrer greyn thai dwell,
  Fragrant of sweit odour and hailsum smell,                          20
  Quhar throw the schawis scheyn in strandis seir
  Erydanus, the hevynly ryver cleyr,
  Flowys contyrmont and vpwart to the lift.
    Within this place, in al plesour and thryft,
  Ar hail the pissance quhilk, in just batal,                         25
  Slane in defens of thar kynd cuntre fell;
  And al thai preistis and religius wightis
  Quhilk levyt chaste cleyn lyfe, as to thame rycht is;
  And al godlyke devote prophetis trew,
  That suythfast thyng worthy to Phebus schew;                        30
  And thai quhilkis, by thar craftys or science fyne,

  And tha by merytabil dedis and gyftis seir
  That maid otheris hald thame in memory:                              5
  Of al thir war the tymplis by and by
  Arrayt with a fresch garland snaw quhite.
    And as thai flokkit abowt Ene, als tyte
  Syk wys onto thame carpys Sibilla;
  Bot principaly to Museus, ane of tha,                               10
  Was stad amyddis of the mekill rowt,
  As sche beheld hym with big schulderis stout:
  O ȝhe so happy sawlys, tellith me,
  And thou, maste souerane poet, schaw, quod sche,
  In quhat regioun and place bene Anchises?                           15
  Hyddir for his saik come we, and with gret pres
  Hes oursalit of hell the gret fludis.
  This ryall lord in few wordis concludis,
  And ansuerit thus; frend, certane dwelling nane
  In this cuntre haue we, bot all ourane                              20
  Walkys and lugis in thir schene wod schawys,
  Endlang thir ryver bankis all on rawys;
  Thar bene our settis, and beddis of fresch flowris
  In soft bene medowis by cleir strandis all howris
  Our habitatioun is and residens.                                    25
  Bot gif ȝour mynd langis to haue presens
  Of Anchises, pas vp ȝone swyre fut het,
  I sall ȝou lyghtly in the hie way set.
  And sayand thus, befor thame furth went he,
  And can thame schaw, apon the hill on hie,                          30
  The schynand planys full of all plesance.
  Agane returnys he, and thai avans,
  Fra thyne discending from the hillis hyght,
  Quhar thai at last of Anchises gat sycht.




CAP. XI.

  _Quhou that Eneas with hys fader met,
  And athir othir with frendly wordis gret._


  The meyn sesson thys Anchises, the prynce,                           5
  Intill a wondir grene vale full of fence
  Sawlys inclusit, quhilkis war forto wend
  To myddil erd and thare in bodeis ascend,
  Can rekkyn, and behald attentfully
  Hail the nowmyr of hys geneologye,                                  10

  Thare conditions, thare strenth and hardyment.
  And sone as he persavys quhar that went
  Forganyst him, cumand throu gresy sward,                            15
  Hys derrest son Ene with hasty fard,
  Baith his handys joyfull furthstracht he than;
  The teris trynglyng our his chekis ran,
  And fra his mouth slydis thir wordis myld:
    Thou art cummyn at last, my deir child;                           20
  Thy gret piete, and kyndnes weil expert
  Onto thy fader, causyt the and gart
  This hard vayage venquys and ourset!
  Quhat! is it grantit me? ha! sall I get
  A verray sight, luffit son, of thy face?
  And grantit ws to carp or talk a space?
  To heir and render frendly wordis knaw?                              5
  Within my mynd ymagynyt I on raw
  Swa suld betyde, and weil belevit I
  Thou was tocum, and the tyme by and by
  I calculit and comptit quhen that suld be;
  And my consait hes nocht dissauyt me.                               10
  O God, throu quhou feill landis braid and large,
  Quhou mony seys ourcareit in thy barge,
  Efter quhou feil dangeris with storm oft schaik,
  I now ressaue the heir, deir son, allaik!
  Quhou gretlie dred I of Lybie that ryng                             15
  Suld the haue hyndrit, and harmyt in sum thing!
    Eneas answeris; fader, thy drery gost,
  Sa oft apperand, maid me seik this cost:
  In Tyrrhean sey abydis our navy.
  Grant me, fader, now grant me by and by,                            20
  We athir may with other handis schaik;
  Fra myne embrasyng withdraw the nocht, allaik!
  And sayand thys, tendyrly wepit he,
  Baithyng hys face in terys gret plente.
  On this wys talkyng, or thar wordis sessit,                         25
  With hys lang armys thrys Eneas pressit
  About hys hals hym forto haue belappit,
  And thrys, invane, hys handys togidder clappit:
  The figur fled as light wynd, or son beym,
  Or mast lykly a waverand sleip or dreym.                            30
    Duryng this tyme Eneas gan aduert,
  Within a vale fer thens closyt apart,
  Quhare stude a wod with swouchand bewys schene,
  The flude Lythee flowand throu the fair grene;
  About the quhilk pepill onnowmerabill,                               5
  And silly sawlys, fleys fast, but fabill,
  Quhil all the feildis of thare dyn resoundis:
  Lyke as, in medowys and fresch florist boundis,
  The bissy beys in schene symmeris tyde,
  On diuers colorit flouris skalit wide,                              10
  Flokkis about the blomyt lylleis quhite,
  And other fragrant blosummys redymyt.
    Mysknawyng quhat this ment, Eneas wight
  Becam abasit of the soddane syght,
  And can inquir the causys of this cace;                             15
  Quhat war tha fludis far befor hys face,
  Or quhat bene tha men in syk numbyr swa
  With so gret fard flokkit to athir bra.
  Tho quod hys fader Anchises; all ȝon be

  Bene other bodeis eftir this yschape,
  Quhilk drynkis ȝondir, or thai may eskape,
  At ȝone ryver and the flude Lythee,
  The sikkyr watir but curis, trastis me,
  Quharby oblyvyus becum thai als tyte,                               25
  Forȝetting pane bipast and langsum syte.

  And schaw befor thy face now standand thar,
  The sawlys all, and numbyr in thy presens,
  Quhilkis ar tocum of my stok and discens;                           30
  So that the mair glaidly with me tharby
  Thou may reios to haue fund Italy.
  O fader, quod Eneas, quhidder or nay
  Is that tobe belevyt at ȝhe say,
  That souerane saulys from this place sall wend,                      5
  Onto the warld abufe or erd ascend?
  Quhy may thai nocht in this swete stede remane,
  Bot sall return in slaw bodeis agane?
  Quhat cursyt covatyce causith wrachit wightis
  So to desyre our life and drery lightis?                            10
    I sall the schaw forsuyth the caus, quod he,
  My derrest son, and sal no wys hald the

  And euery thing per ordour thus he tald.




CAP. XII.

  _The seir punitioun of sawlis in purgatorye,
  And quhou thai pas syne to the flude Lythe._


  Fra the begynnyng, all thing les and mar,
  The fyry regioun, the erth, and the ayr,
  The plane flowand boundis of the sey,
  The lyghtnyt monys lamp that lemys hie,                             20
  The hevynnys starnys, and bryght sonnys ball,
  Ane spreit thar is within, sustenys all:
  In euery part the hie wysdome dyvyne
  Diffundit movys this warldis hail engyne,
  And by hys power mydlit is our all
  This mekil body clepit vniuersal.
  Fra this infusioun, and thir elementis seir,                         5
  Baith kynd of man and best cummys, but weir,
  All levyng foulys fleying in the ayr,
  All fyschis, and the monstreis doith repar
  Vndre the slekit sey of marbill hew.
  A hait fyry power, warm and dew,                                    10

  Sa far as that thir noysum bodeis cald
  Nocht tareis thame tharfra, nor doith withhald,

  Thar erdly lymmys, and eik thar irksum mynd,
  Throu thar mortal membris euer deidlike,
  Dullith thar curage and thar spretis godlyke.
  Fra the quhilk cummys to al mankynd, that thai

  Nor, in the dyrk mansioun and preson blynd
  Of thir vyle bodeis yfettyrit and bynd,
  The sawlis thar clene natur may attend.
  So fer that, all efter the lattir end,
  Quhen that the lif disseueris fra the body,                         25
  Than, netheles, not ȝit are fullely
  All harm ne cryme from wrachit sawlis separate,
  Nor ald infectioun come of the body layt:
  And thus, aluterly, it is neidfull thing

  And purgit on seir wonderfull wys to say.
  Tharfor thai suffir panys and torment,
  For thar inveterat vycis ald bywent

  Of sum the cryme committit clengit be

  And in the fyre the gilt of other sum
  Is purefyit and clengit all and sum.                                10
  Ilk ane of ws hys ganand purgatory

  Onto the large feildis of Elysee:
  Thar bene of ws nane, bot a few menȝe,

  And heir mon dwell quhil that the lang day,

  For that it fand sum tyme the body sweit,                           20
  And quhil it be so purefyit and fynd,

  And subtel pure flambe celestiall.
  Thir other sawlis quhilk bene purgit all,

CAP. XV.

  _Anchises gevis Eneas gud teching,
  To gyde the pepill vnder his governyng._


  The pepil of othir realmys, son, said he,
  Bene mor expert in craftis, and mar sle
  To forge and kerf lyflyke staturis of bras,
  Be contenans as the spreit tharin was:
  I trast, forsuyth, heirefter mony ane                                5
  Sal hew quyk facis furth of marbil stane;
  Sum otheris bettir can thar causis pled;
  Sum bene mar crafty in ane other sted,
  With rewlis and with mesouris by and by
  For til exers the art of geometry;                                  10
  And sum mor subtel to descryve and prent
  The starnys movyng and the hevynnys went:
  Bot thou, Romane, remember, as lord and syre,
  To rewle the pepil vnder thyne empyre;
  Thir sal thy craftis be, at weil may seme,                          15
  The peax to modefy and eik manteme,
  To pardon all cumis ȝoldin and recryant,
  And prowd rabellis in batale forto dant.
    Thus said the noble fader Anchyses meik;
  As thai awondrit can thir wordis eik:                               20
  Behald Marcus Marcellus mast douchty,
  Quhar that he walkis, lo, sa gloriusly,
  With the rich spulȝe triumphale deirly dycht,
  Quhilk he reft from his aduersar in fyght,
  As the maste vailȝeant victor that I ken,
  In bonty doith exceid all other men.
  This worthy knycht the common weil Romane,
  In gret affray perturbit, to rest agane
  And quyet sal restor, and ȝon is he                                  5
  That venquys sal the Affricane menȝe,
  And the Franch rebellioun sall down bet:
  The thrid armour or rych spulȝe gret,
  Reft from chiftane of weir, this Marcellus
  Sall hyng vp to the fader Quirynus.                                 10
    And for alsmekil as Eneas saw
  In falloschip with this Marcus raik on raw
  A sembly springald, a far ȝong galland,
  Rycht schaply maid, in armour brycht schynand;
  Bot his vissage semyt scarsly blith,                                15
  With luke doun cast, as in his face dyd kith
  That he was sum deill sad and no thing lycht;
  Fader, quod he, quhat be ȝon drery knycht,
  Quhilk haldis so with ȝon prince company?
  Quhidder his son, or sum nevo worthy,                               20
  Of our gret lynage and successioun?
  O lord, how gret brute, noys, and sovn,
  Of confluens that walkyng him about!
  Quhou gret apperance is in hym, but dout,
  Tilbe of prowes, and a valȝeant knycht!                             25
  Bot a blak sop of myst, als dyrk as nycht,
  With drery schaddo bilappis his hed.
    The fader tho, Anchises, in the sted,
  With teris bristyng furth, begouth to say;
  O my sweit son, inquir nocht, I the pray,                           30
  The excedand regret and womanting
  Of thame bene fortocum of thyne ofspring.
  The fatis sall bot for a litill space
  Schaw ȝon man to the erth and warldly place,
  And sall no langer suffer him tharin.                                5
  O goddis abufe, the Romanys blude and kyn
  Semyt to ȝou our myghty and potent,
  Gif so it war the giftis ȝhe hym lent
  Had remanyt, or lang his lyfe had lest.
  Quhou gret murnyng of men all forcyest,                             10
  For hym, furth of the feildis marcyall,
  Sall dyn and resound to the cite wall!
  And O thou God of the flude Tyberyne,
  Quhou mony fertyrris and duyl habetis schyne
  Sall thou behald, as thou flowis at Rome                            15
  Down by his new maid sepultur or tovme!
  Ne nevir child cummyn of Troiane blude
  In sic beleif, and glory, and gret gude,
  Sal rays his forbearis Italianys;
  Ne nevir, certis, the grund of the Romanys                          20
  Of ony fostir sal him so avance.
  Allace, quhat harm of thy disseuerance!
  Of thy gret piete, and thyne ancyent treuth,
  Thy hand onvenquyst in batale, O quhat reuth!
  Nane suld, but dammage, hym in harnes meit,                         25
  Quhidder so aganyst him he went on feit,
  Or ȝit on horsbak, as thir knychtis rydis,
  With spurris brochand the fomy stedis sydis.
  Allace my child, so worthy to be menyt!
  Worthy tobe bewalit and complenyt!                                  30
  Gyf them thyne hard werdis mycht vincus,
  Thou salbe namyt the souerane Marcellus.
  Of fresch lilleis reke me my handis full:
  The purpour flowris I sall skattir and pull,
  That I may strow, with sik rewardis at lest,                         5
  My nevoys sawle, to culȝe and to fest,
  And, but profit, sik costage sall exers.
    Apon this wys seir thingis dyd rehers
  Anchises; and thus wide quhar thai do walk
  Our al that regioun, haldand spech and talk                         10
  Within the large feildis of hailsum air,
  And euery thing per ordour visseyt thar.
  And efter that Anchises, hand in hand,
  Had thus his son led our all that land,
  And his curage inflambit by and by                                  15
  With the gret fame tocum and hie glory:
  Syne to this valȝeant man he rekkynys heir,
  Per ordour, all the batalis and the weir
  Quhilk eftir this he had to ber on hand;
  And of the pepill eik in Latyn land,                                20
  And of the cite of the kyng Latyne,
  He him instrukkis; and tharefter syne
  Taucht him quhat wys he myght sustene or fle
  Ever hard danger or aduersite.
    Thar bene ordanyt for dremys ȝettis twane,                        25
  Quharof, thai say, of horn forgit is ane,
  At quham the suythfast swevynnys by and by
  Departis all ways, and ischis furth lychtly:
  The tother port is forgit wail perfite
  Of eliphantyne and polist evor quhite;                              30
  Bot tharat goddis infernal lattis owt
  The fals swevynnys to the warld about.
    So as Anchises had, apon this wys,
  Rehersit, as said is, all thingis at devys,
  Sibilla and his son togidder at schort                               5
  He leit depart furth at the evor port.
  Eneas spedis the strecht way to the schippis,
  And can vissy agane his falloschippis:

THE PROLOUG OF THE SEVYNT BUKE.


  As bryght Phebus, scheyn souerane hevynnys E,
  The opposit held of hys chymmys hie,
  Cleir schynand bemys, and goldyn symmyris hew,
  In laton cullour alteryng haill of new;
  Kythyng no syng of heyt be hys vissage,                              5
  So neir approchit he his wyntir stage;
  Reddy he was to entyr the thrid morn
  In clowdy skyis vndre Capricorn:
  All thocht he be the hart and lamp of hevyn,
  Forfeblit wolx hys lemand gylty levyn,                              10
  Throu the declynyng of hys large round speir.
  The frosty regioun ryngis of the ȝer,
  The tyme and sesson bittir, cald, and paill,
  Tha schort days that clerkis clepe brumaill:
  Quhen brym blastis of the northyn art                               15
  Ourquhelmyt had Neptunus in his cart,
  And all to schaik the levis of the treis,
  The rageand storm ourweltrand wally seys;
  Ryveris ran reid on spait with watir brovne,
  And burnys hurlys all thar bankis dovne,                            20
  And landbrist rumland rudely with sik beir,
  So lowd ne rumyst wild lyoun or ber;
  Fludis monsteris, sik as meirswyne or quhalis,
  Fro the tempest law in the deip devalis.
  Mars occident, retrograde in his speir,
  Prouocand stryfe, regnyt as lord that ȝer;
  Rany Oryon with his stormy face                                      5
  Bewavit oft the schipman by hys race;
  Frawart Saturn, chill of complexioun,
  Throu quhais aspect darth and infectioun
  Beyn causyt oft, and mortal pestilens,
  Went progressyve the greis of his ascens;                           10
  And lusty Hebe, Junoys douchtir gay,
  Stude spulȝeit of hir office and array.
  The soyl ysowpit into watir wak,
  The firmament ourcast with rokis blak;
  The grond fadyt, and fawch wolx all the feildis,                    15
  Montane toppis slekit with snaw ourheildyis;
  On raggit rolkis of hard harsk quhyn stane
  With frosyn frontis cauld clynty clewis schane:
  Bewte was lost, and barrand schew the landis,
  With frostis hair ourfret the feldis standis.                       20
  Seir bittir bubbis, and the schowris snell,
  Semyt on the sward a symylitude of hell,
  Reducyng to our mynd, in euery sted,
  Gousty schaddois of eild and grisly ded.
  Thik drumly skuggis dyrknyt so the hevyn,                           25
  Dym skyis oft furth warpit feirfull levyn,
  Flaggis of fire, and mony felloun flaw,
  Scharpe soppys of sleit, and of the snypand snaw.
  The dolly dichis war all donk and wait,
  The law valle flodderit all with spait,                             30
  The plane stretis and euery hie way
  Full of floschis, dubbis, myre, and clay;

  Bank, bra, and boddum, blanchit wolx and bar;                        5
  For gurl weddir growit bestis hair;
  The wynd maid waif the red wed on the dyke,
  Bedowyn in donkis deip was euery sike;
  Our craggis, and the front of rochis seir,
  Hang gret ische schouchlis lang as ony speir;                       10

  Haldand the hight all thocht the son went law.

  Vgsum to heir was hir wild elrich screke:
  The wild geis claking eik by nyghtis tyde

    On slummyr I slaid full sad, and slepit sound

  Approching neir the greking of the day,

  So fast declynys Synthea the moyn,                                   5

  With hirstis harsk of waggand wyndill strays;

  And scharp hailstanys, mortfundeit of kynd,

  The schot I closit, and drew inwart in hy,
  Chyvirrand for cald, the sesson was so snell;
  Schupe with hayt flambe to fleym the fresyng fell.

  _King Latyn of the goddis had command_
  _To wed hys douchter with man of onkouth land._


  Tho gan the sey of bemys walxin red,
  And heich abuf, dovn from the hevinly sted,
  Within hyr rosy cartis cleirly schane
  Aurora vestit into brovn sanguane.
  Eftir the wyndys lownyt war at will,                                 5
  And all the blastis pacefyit and still,

  With ayris palmys sweip thai furth thar way.
  And suddanly heir from the stabillit see
  A large semly schaw beheld Enee;                                    10
  Amyddis quham the flude he gan aspy
  Of Tybir flowand soft and esely,
  With sworland welis, and mekill ȝallow sand,
  Into the sey dyd entyr fast at hand.

  About the watir, abuf vp in the clewis,
  On bankis weilbyknaw and fludis bay,

  Gan meys and glaid the hevynnys and the ayr,
  And throw the schaw went fleand our alquhar.
  To turn thar course he gan his feris command,                        5
  And stevin thar schippis to the sammyn land:

    Now, thou my muse, Erato, I the pray,
  Do schaw me this, at I may scharply say                             10
  Quhat kynd proces of tyme was, and quhat kyngis

  From the begynnyng of the first debayt.
  O thou sweit goddes, O thou haly wight,
  Convoy and tech thy poet to say ryght!
  I sall the horribill batellis schaw and tell,
  The bludy ostis, and the feildis fell;                              20

  And all the gret rowtis of Italy
  Assemblit into armys on the land.                                   25

  And to this Fawnus fader was alsswa
  Picus the kyng, quhilk doith the represent,

  Thou was the fyrst gan all thar blude begyn,
  The first fundment and cheif stok of kyn.                           10
  By dispositioun of the goddis dyvyn,
  Son nor manchild nane had kyng Latyn;
  For alsmekill as his ȝong son, a page,
  Decessit was within his tendir age.
  The kyngis palice, and all that riall hald,                         15

  Abuf all other maste gudly personage,
  And tharto rich of frendis, and myghty
  Of eldris gret and riall anchestry;
  Quham kyng Latinus spows, queyn Amata,                              25
  With diligens dyd procur, day by day,
  That he adionyt war thar son in law:
  Bot feirfull syngnys by the goddis schaw,
  And syndry terrouris gan tharto ganestand.
    Amyddis of the palyce clos dyd stand,                             30
  With blisfull bewis, a fair grene lawrer,
  Haldyn in dreid and wirschip mony a ȝer;
  Quham this ilk prynce and fader Latinus
  Dyd consecrat and hallow to Phebus,
  For that he fand it growand in the feild                             5
  Quhar he hys ryall palyce first dyd beild:
  The indwellaris of the grond, eftir this tre,

  Betyd a wondir takynyng for to say:

  The clene schidis of the dry fyre brandis,
  Quhar that also fast by hir fader standis

  A selcouth thing to se, in hir syde hair                            30
  It semyt the hait fyre kyndillit bricht,
  And hir gay clething al with lowis lyght

  Certis, this was reput with ȝyng and ald
  A grisly thing and wondrus to behald;
  For the diuinys declaris by and by

  That is to knaw, at this ilk maid suld be                           15

  Of sik monstreis, gan do seik belyve                                20

  The flowr sconnys war set in, by and by,
  With othir mesis, sik as war reddy;

  And followis on the answer stupefac:

  Onto hys wordys thus wys answer maid.

  In message send ws heir to thy cite.
  Quhou gret tempest of batale and debait

  Quhat fatale bargane thar maid and defens,

  That is to say, Europ and Asya:
  And gif thar ony ferthir regioun be,
  Diuidit be the streym and occiane see                               20
  Fra the ferm land, tharof thai haue hard tell;
  And thai alsso, gif ony thar may dwell,

  The bair sey cost, hurtand na mannys rycht,
  With air and watir common to euery wight.
  Na mair lak to ȝour realm sall we be,
  Nor na repreif tharby to ȝour renowne
  Be ws, nor nane other, sal nevir spreid;                             5
  Nor ȝit the thankis of sa frendful a deid

  Nor Italy, with hir braid bundis and wide,
  Sal nevir repent that scho the folk of Troy                         10

  Quhilk of our fre will onrequirit we offir,
  With wordis of request and of trety,
  The takynnys in our handis born vp hye:
  For oft the fatis of the goddis seir
  Has ws compellit by thar strang power                               25
  Onto ȝour landis and thir costis seik.
  Schir Dardanus born of this cuntre eik
  Desiris hiddir to return agane;
  And with commandmentis strait, ful mony ane,
  Appollo chargit ws to sper bedene
  To Tybyr, flowand in the sey Tirrene,                               30
  And to the fontane and the strandis cleir
  Of Numycus, the hallowit fresch ryver.
  And forthir eik our prince hes to the sent
  Of his ald fortoun bot a smal present,
  The sobir levyngis rest from Troys fyre.                             5
  Into this cowp of gold Anchises hys syre
  At the altar was wont to sacrify;
  And of the gret kyng Pryam, mast douchty,
  This was the cheif dyademe our the laif,
  With quham he crownyt sat and domys gaif;                           10
  Hys ceptre als, and eik his tyar hat,
  Hallowit quharwith at sacrifice he sat;
  And this was eik hys precius rob ryall,
  By Troiane ladeis wrocht and brusyt all.
    Herand sic wordis of Ilioneus,                                    15
  Ful stil his vissage haldis Latynus;
  Hys syght onmovyt to the erd dyd he prent,
  Witht eyn rollyng, and erys rycht attent.
  The brusyt purpour movis hym na thing,
  Nor Priamus ceptour sa sar steris the kyng,                         20
  As that he musys thochtfull gretumly
  Apon his douchteris spousage and ally,
  And in his mind gan cumpas oft infeir
  His fader Faunus respons and answer;
  Thynkand this ilk Eneas semyt to be                                 25
  The self stranger, quham fatale destanee

  By thar power suld joys and occupy
  The haill warld vndre thar senȝeory.
  And at the last, eftir ful lang musyng,
  Witht joyus cheir on this wys said the kyng:

  And thar pronosticatioun manifest in deid.
  I grant thyne axyng, Troiane messynger,
  And ȝour rewardis ressauys in thank; for heir

  Ne ȝit nane othir welth, weilfar, and joy,

  Bot, at the lest, ȝe caus ȝour prince Enee,                         15

  And be clepit our companȝeoun or brother,                           20
  Dwel no langar, bot cum hidder in haist,

  For the mast part of our convene and band

  And thou of frendis may mak mortale fays,

  Socht first to Latyum, and the chymmys hee
  Of Lawrentyn, the kyngis cheif cite,                                10
  And prevely begouth awach and lowr
  About his spous quene Amatais bour;
  Quhilk, all inflambit in ire and wifely thochtis
  Of this new come of Troianys, all on flocht is,
  The bissy curis of Turnus mariage                                   15
  Skaldyng hir breist and mynd half in a rage.
  Thys wikkyt Goddes towart hir alsfast

  Deip in hir bosum leyt inslip with slycht,
  Amyd hir hart pipis or precordialis lycht;                          20
  That be this ilk monstris instigatioun
  Wod wraith scho suld perturble al the toun.

  And sum tyme of hir curche, lap with a waif,

  And depe amyd hir banys forto skaill
  And multiply the rage or byrnand fury;
  For ȝit nocht all our hyr breist cruelly

  Quharfor the mar sobirly furth with all,                            20
  Eftir the commoun custum and vsage
  Of ald matronys in thar wyld dotage,
  With huge complaynt for hir dochter and regrate,
  And Troiane wedlok contrar hir consate,
  Thus said scho weping, and that ful petuusly:                       25

  Sa feil syth gevin to our cousyng Turnus?
  Gyf that thou sekis ane alienar onknaw,                             15

  And hes that thing determyt in thy hed,
  Constrenyt tharto by the command and red
  Of thy fader Fawnus: as to that gate,
  Heir a litil my fantasy and consate.                                20
  All cuntre onsubieckit vnder our wand,

  And al at thar indwellis alienaris bene;
  Of sik strangeris the goddis spak, I weyn.
  And gyf we list seik forthir mar, ȝit than                          25

  Thus is he Greik, to compt his greis a pece,
  And cum of Myce the myddil realm of Grece.                          30
    Eftir at the quene with sik wordis, all for nocht,

  And fand at he resistit hyr entent,

  And dyd our all partis of hir body spreid;
  So that, forsuyth, cacchit onhappely

  Throw owt the large cite in wild dotage,
  But resson, strikkin with the nymphis rage.                         10
  As sum tyme sclentys the round tap of tre,
  Hyt with the twynyt quhip dois quhirl, we se,
  Quham childyr dryvis bissy at thar play

  Scho smyttyn with the tawys dois rebound,                           15
  And rynnys about, abowt, in cirkill round;

  And all thar mynd settis it to cach and dryve:
  Na slawar went Amata, the kyngis wife,
  Throw owt the myd citeis of Latyn land,
  And throu the fers pepill, fra hand to hand.
  And forthir eik, onto the woddis grene                              25
  With swyft fard cacchys furth this quene,

  Thow only art worthy to haue our virgyne;
  And this with lovd voce cryis and schowtis sche.                     5

  To the hir hair addressit leit down hyng.                           10
    The fame heirof wyde our all dyd spreid,
  Quhill at the last the sammyn fury can spreid
  In all the matronys brestis of the land:
  Cacchit with fors tha flok fra hand to hand,
  Thar howsis thai forhow and levis waist,                            15
  And to the woddis socht as thai war chaist,

  Gif ony thocht remordis ȝour myndis alssua
  Of the effectuus piete maternall;                                    5
  Lows hed bandis, schake down ȝour haris all,
  Walk in this wod heir caraland with me,
  Syng Bacchus sangis, sen na bettir may be.

  And hir in schap transformyt of a trat,

  And to succeid in his realm hes besocht

  Haue done therfor, assembil this cuntre,
  Addres thy sensabill men in thar array,

  And haue experiens of the, Turnus, in armys,
  Bot he the grant to wife his child Lavyne,
  And kepe to the hys promys and convyne.
    The ȝyng man mokkand at the prophetes,
  Herand sic speche, answeris with mouth expres:                      20
  It standis not so as thou wenys, but weris;
  The messynger is nocht gone by myne erys,

  Quhilk voyd is of all treuth and verite,
  In sic curys invane occupyis the,
  And the dissavis, as prophet, be fals dreid,
  That gevis thi mynd tharon thou has na heid,
  As forto treyt of batalis betwix kyngis:                             5

    At sic wordis Alecto, hait as fyre,
  Brynt in hir fury rage and felloun ire,
  So that, the ȝong man spekand, suddanly

  And hir figour sa grysly gret abundis,
  With glowrand eyn byrnand of flawmys blak.
    Turnus awondryng styntis and drawis abak;                         20
  And, as he purposit mekill mar to say,
  Insted of haris scho rasit vp serpentis tway,
  And of hir scurge the sound scho made him heir;
  With rageand mouth syne said and fellown beir:
    Behaldis this my vile onweldy age,                                25
  Ourset with hasart hair and faynt dotage,
  Quham eild, void of al trewth and verite,
  Be fals dreid dissavys so, quod sche,
  As forto treyt of batale betwix kyngis:
  Behald gif it so be, consider thir syngis;                          30
  Lo me present, ane of the sisteris thre,
  Infernal fureis of feirfull hellis see;
  Se, I bar in my handis and power
  The ded of batalis and the mortale were.
    And sayand thus, at this ilk fers ȝyng knycht                      5
  Ane hait fyre brand kest scho byrnand brycht,
  And in hys breste this furyus lemand schide
  With dedly smok fixit deyp can hyde.
  The huge dreid with this dissoluyt his slepe,
  Our all his body bristing furth dyd crepe                           10
  The warm swait throw euery lith and bane,
  And all enragit can eftir harnes frane;
  Armour, all wytles, in his bed sekis he,
  Armour, our all the lugyng law and hie.
  The gret curage of irne wapynnys can waid                           15
  Cruell and wild, and all his wyt invaid
  In wikkit wodnes batale to desire,
  Quharon he byrnys hait in felloun ire:
  Lyke as quhen that the ingill of stikkis dry
  With blesand sownd is layd to by and by,                            20
  About the sydis of the pot playing,
  The licour sparklis for the heyt bulyng;
  Within, the fervent bullyr violent
  Of watir makyng reky froith vpsprent;
  So swellis vp the skum and bellis bedene,                           25
  The veschell may na mar the broth contene,
  Bot furth it poplys in the fyre heir and thar,
  Quhill vp fleys the blak stew in the air.
  And for alsmekill as Turnus thus was stad,
  The gretast of hys chiftanys go he bad                              30
  To kyng Latyn, and him declar, but wer,
  The paix was brokyn, and he wald move the were:
  To graith thar armour fast commandis he,

  For hie prowes knawin in ilke landis,

    This hart of body was baith gret and squar,                       15
  With large hed, and tyndis burnyst far;
  Quham childir of ane Tyrrheus thame amang,
  Reft from his moderis pap, had nurysit lang:

  Of studdis, flokkis, bowis, and heirdis wide,                       20
  As storour to the kyng, dyd kepe and ȝym,
  Of the large plane all trast was gevin to hym.

  Full weil sufferit hir handis the tame deir,                        30
  And was accustomyt so quhen he list eyt,

  Onto his kynd resset can fleyng hame,
  And entrys in his stall, and that onone
  All blude besprent, with mony grank and grone,

  With hys plenyng all the hows fillis he.

THE PROLOUG OF THE AUCHT BUKE.


  Of dreflyng and dremys quhat dow it to endite?
  For, as I lenyt in a ley in Lent this last nycht,
  I slaid on a swevynnyng, slummyrrand a lite,
  And sone a selcouth seg I saw to my sycht,
  Swownand as he swelt wald, sowpyt in syte,                           5
  Was nevir wrocht in this warld mair wofull a wycht;
  Ramand, Resson and rycht is rent be fals ryte,
  Frendschip flemyt is in Frans, and faith hes the flycht,

  Musyng marris our myrth half mangit al most;
  So thochtis thretis in thra our brestis ourthwort,

  Thar is na sege for na schame that schrynkis at schort,
  May he cum to hys cast be clokyng, but cost,                        20

  All is weill done, God wate, weild he hys will.

CAP. I.

  _Quhou Tiberinus, god of the ryver,
  Till Eneas in visioun gan appeir._


  As thys convyne and ordinance was maid
  Of Latyum throw owt the boundis braid,
  Quhilk, euery poynt, this Troiane lord onon,
  Cummyn of the hows of kyng Laomedon,
  In hevy curis flowand all on flocht,                                 5
  Avysys weill, how all this thing was wrocht:
  And hastely in mynd on euery sydis
  Now for this purpos, now for that, providis,
  Now heir, now thar, ryvest in syndry partis,
  And sersys, turnand to and fra all artis.                           10
  Lyke as the radyus sonnys bemys brycht,
  Or than the glymmerand monys schaddo lycht,
  Reflexit from the brasyn veschell, we se,
  Fillyt with watir to the cirkyll on hie,
  Our all the hows reboundis and doys spreid                          15
  Schynand, and sersys euery sted on breid,
  Quhil in the ayr vpgoys the twynkland lycht,
  Glitterand on euery spar and ruf on hyght.
    The nycht come, and all thing levand sessit;
  Wery of wark baith byrd and brutal best
  Our all the landis war at rest ilkane,                               5
  The profound swouch of sleip had thame ourtane;
  Quhen this ilk prince, Eneas, all on flocht,
  With mynd sowpyt in cuyr and hevy thocht,
  And for this sorofull batale richt onglaid,
  Apon the ryver bank hym self dovn laid                              10
  Vndre the cald firmament for the nanys,
  And gave schort rest onto his wery banys.
  Quham to the God of that sted dyd appeir,
  Tyberynus, furth of the still ryver,
  Amyd the branchis of the popill treys,                              15
  As agyt man semyng hym self vpheis:
  A lenȝe watry garmond dyd hym vaill,
  Of cullour fawch, schaip lyke a hempyn saill,
  And leiffy redis dekkis weill hys haris:
  To meys Eneas thochtis and hys sarys,                               20
  Thus he begouth to speke, and sayd, but dyn:
    O gentill get, cummyn of hie goddis kyn,
  Quhilk from thy fays to ws with mekill joy
  Hes hyddir brocht the gret cite of Troy,
  And Pergama, the Troiane wallys wight,                              25
  Eternaly conservis throu thy myght;
  Desyrit maist of lang tyme, now welcum
  Onto the grond and soill of Lawrentum,
  And all the feildis eik of Latyn land:
  Heir is thy sikkir duellyng place at hand,                          30
  Ane sovir ferm habitatioun for ay:
  Withdraw the not fra hyne, pas nocht away,
  Nor dreid na thing the bost of this batell.
  The rancour all of Goddis, I the tell,
  And boldynand wreth, appesyt ar almaste.                             5
  And so thow weyn not at my wordis be waist,
  Nor fenȝeit dremys do to the appeir,
  Vndyr sawch treis by thir bankis neir
  Onon thou sall do fynd a mekill swyne,
  With thretty hed ferreyt of grysys syne,                            10

  Hyr quhite brodmell abowt hyr pappis wond.
  That is the place to set vp thy cite,

  Ascanyus sal do beld of lyme and stanys
  The cite hait fair Alba of delyte,
  Berand hys name fra the fair cullour quhite.
  Thus I declar the nane oncertane thing,
  Bot verray suythfast takynnys and warnyng.                          20

  And in hys hand straucht furth, at he mycht se,

  Fra tyme that he first forto speke began,

  And at the sammyn rays hys vayage maid

  The dreid adionyt weyngis to his feyt.
  And, fra he had hym self sesyt tharin,                              25
  A stane of huge weght for to clos the gyn
  He leyt do fall, and with sic haist doun thrang,
  The chenȝeis brak quharwith it festnyt hang,
  That forgit war by hys faderis engyne;
  With gret irne slottis schet the entre syne.                        30
  Bot lo, in haist Hercules come at hand
  With furyus mynd careyng our the land,
  Passage and entre sekyng bissely,
  Now heir his eyn, now thar, rollyng in hy,
  Graslyng hys teith, and byrnand full of ire.                         5
  Of Aventynus hill thrys all the swyre
  He sersys our, and thrys assays he
  To brek and rent that craggy stone entre;
  Bot all for nocht, thocht he was nevir sa wight:
  So, thrys irkyt, doun from the hillys hyght                         10
  To rest hym is he to the valle gone.
  Thar stude a pynnakil of quhyn or flynt stone,
  Apon the baksyde of this cavern cald,
  That rays on end rycht hie forto behald,
  For wild fowlys of reif a ganand sted,                              15
  That rent raw flesch of bestis bonys ded;
  The craggis all about this rolk war worn,
  With wedderis blast to holkyt and to torn:
  And as it stud on schor sweyand that tyde,
  Downwith the bank towart the watir syde,                            20
  Hercules it smytis with a mychty towk
  Apon the rycht half, forto mak it jowke,
  Inforsyng hym to welt it our the bra;
  And sa rudly it branglys to and fra,
  That from the rutis he it lowsyt and rent,                          25
  And tumlyt dovn fra thyne, or he wald stent.
  The large ayr dyd reirding with the rusch,
  The brays dyndlit, and all dovn can dusch;
  The ryver wolx effrayt with the rak,
  And, demmyt with the rokis, ran abak.                               30
    Than this gret cove, of Cacus sail ryall,
  Was discoverit; hys inwart cavernys all,
  Wont tobe dyrk, worth patent now and knaw:
  Non otherwys than quhen the erd ourthraw
  By fors of thundyr, or erdquake with a clap,                         5
  Ryvys vp a terribill sewch or grisly gap,
  Oppynnand the hellis mansioun infernall,
  And onclosys that dyrk regioun paill
  Quhilk of the goddis al abufe is hayt;
  Or thocht the hellis bysme in sik estait                            10
  War oppynnyt, that his bodum se men mycht,
  And dampnyt sawlys effrayt of new lycht.
  Quharfor this worthy stalwart Hercules,
  That on this wys had Cacus set in pres,
  And fund onwarnyst by this lycht suddane,                           15
  Quhar he was closyt in a cave of stane,
  Fast rumesand apon a strange maner;
  This campyoun with dartis fell of weir
  Gan down tobet, and in his wod fury
  Eftir all kynd wapynnys can do cry,                                 20
  With branchis rent of treis, and querral stanys
  Of huge weght dovn warpand all at anys.
  Bot this ilk Cacus, quhen that he dyd se
  Fra this danger thar was na way to fle,
  Furth of his throt, a wondrus thing to tell,                        25
  A laithly smok he ȝiskis blak as hell,
  And all the hous involuyt with dyrk mist,
  That sone the sycht vanyst, or ony wist,
  And reky nycht within a litill thraw
  Gan thikkyn our al the cavern and ourblaw,                          30
  And with the myrknes mydlit sparkis of fyre.
    The hie curage of Hercules, lordly syre,
  Mycht this no langar suffir, bot in the gap
  With hasty stert amyd the fyre he lap,
  And thar as maist habundyt smokis dyrk,                              5
  With huge sop of reyk and flambis myrk,
  So that the caif dyd glevyn of the heyt,
  Thar has he hynt Cacus, that wikkyt spreit,
  That al invane hys hait kyndlyng furth gaspyt;
  For as a ball he hym in armys claspyt,                              10
  And so strenȝeis hys throt, furth chirt hys eyn,
  Hys hals worth dry of blude. Than mycht be seyn
  This mirk dungeon and onsemly hald:
  The entre oppynnyt Hercules the bald,
  Bet doun the closeris, and syne brocht to the lycht                 15
  Hys oxin fra him reft by subtel slycht;
  And by the feyt furth harlyt was onon
  Of Cacus the deformyt carion.
  The hartis than and myndis of our menȝe
  Mycht not be satisfyit on him to luke and se,                       20
  As to behald hys vgly eyn twane,
  Hys terribil vissage, and hys grisly gane,
  The rouch byrsys on the breist and creste
  Of that monstruos half deil wilde beiste,
  And in his gorge stikkand the sloknyt fyre.                         25
    Evir sen that tyme, to Hercules the gret syre
  We haue this honour mayd and sacrifice,
  Al our ofspring and ȝong men on this wys
  This day kepis solempnyte, as ȝe se;
  Potitius first master heir with me,                                 30
  And the famyll of Pynaria the bald,
  The cheif keparis of Hercules hallowyt hald,

  Call on our patron common God dyvyne is,
  And with gud will do skynk and birl the wynys.
  Thus sayand, the party popill grayn

  Than ilk man smertly tastis the wyne at tabill,
  Prayand thar goddis for tobe aggreable.

CAP. VI.

  _Quhou kyng Evander rehersis til Enee
  In eldris days the rewle of that cuntre._


  Thys kyng Evandrus than, the first foundar
  Of Romys burgh or palyce, can declar
  And dyd rehers ontil his gest Enee:
  Thir woddis and thir schawis all, quod he,
  Sum tyme inhabyt war and occupyit
  With Nymphis and Fawnys apon euery syde,
  Quhilk fairfolkis, or than elvys, clepyng we,                        5
  That war engendryt in this sam cuntre,
  That with ane kynd of men yborn, but leys,
  Furth of ald stokkis and hard runtis of treis;
  Quhilkis nowder maneris had nor polecy,
  Ne couth thai eir the ground, nor occupy                            10
  The plewis, nor the oxin ȝok infeir,
  Nor ȝit had craft to conquys nor wyn geir,
  Nor kepe thar moblis quhen it gadderit was;
  Bot, as thir bestis, or the doillit as,
  Thar fude of treis dyd in woddis fet,                               15
  Or of the wild veneson scharp to get.
  First from the hie hevynnys into this land
  Saturnus com, fleand gret Jovis brand,
  Hys realmys reft, and banyst eik was he:
  Bot tha ontaucht pepill of this cuntre,                             20
  That skatterit dwelt in his hillis greyn,
  He maid forgadder togidder and conveyn,
  Gaue thame lawys and statutis thame to lede,
  And wald also this regioun euery sted
  War callit Latium, and clepit to hys name,                          25
  For that he surely lurkyt in the same.
  And as thai tel, and redis in mony ryme,
  Of gold the warld was in that kyngis tyme;
  Sa lykandly, in paix and liberte,
  At eys his common pepill governyt he:                               30
  Quhil, peis and peis, the elde syne war and war
  Begouth to wolx, that cullour fading far,
  As, in the sted of paix, the rage of wer
  Begouth succeid, and covatys of geyr.
  Syne the pissance com of Ausonya,                                    5
  And the pepill Sycany hecht alsswa,
  By quham the land of Saturn, war and wys,
  Hes left and changit his ald name oft sys.
  Syne kyngis com, amangis quham for the nonys
  Stern Tybrys rygnyt, a man byg of bonys,                            10
  Fra quham, ay syne, all the Italiane blude
  Thar gret ryver hes clepit Tibrys flude;
  Thus Albula hys auld trew name hes lost.
  And me also to duel within this cost,
  Banyst and flemyt of my natyve land,                                15
  Strang destany, quhilk may nocht be gaynstand,
  And fortoun eik, clepit omnipotent,
  Throu all extremys of sey hes hidder sent.
  The reuerend als and dreidfull monysyngis
  Of Carmentes my moder, in mony thingis                              20
  Expert as nymphe and prophetes dyvyne,
  And the autorite of god Appollyne,
  Hes me constrenyt to dwel in this hald.
    Scars hes Evandrus all thir wordis tald,
  Quhen, walkyng thens furth bot a litil space,                       25
  He can do schaw the altar and the place
  Quhilk in the langage Romane ȝit, sans faill,
  Is to this day clepit port Carmentaill;
  Quharby ramemmorit is in the ilk tovn
  This ald Carmentes wirschip and renovn,                             30
  Quhilk was baith nymphe and fatale prophetes,
  That first declarit, in hir sawys expres,
  The gret pryncis fortocum of Ene,
  And of Pallenteum the nobilite.
  The kyng syne schew him to the haly schaw,                           5
  Quhilk strang Romulus dyd reduce and draw
  In maner of franches or of sanctuary.
  He schew him eik, but ony langar tary,
  Vnder the frosty bra, the coif, was call
  Ful mony ȝeris in thar leid Lupercall,                              10
  Eftir thar gys of Arcad and estait,
  To Pan the god of Lyce consecrait.
  He schew alsso the wod hait Argilete,
  That to the man of Arge, thar lost the swete,
  Was dedicat, and drew to witnes that sted                           15
  That he was nevir culpabill of his ded,
  And can to him declar the mater plane,
  Quhat wys his gest, this man of Arge, wes slane.
  Fra thyne, to mont Tarpeya he him kend,
  And beknyt to that sted, fra end to end,                            20
  Quhar now standis the goldin Capitoll,
  Vmquhil of wild buskis rowch skroggy knoll.
  Thocht, the ilk tyme, ȝit of that dreidfull place
  Ane feirfull reuerent religioun, per cace,
  The ery rural pepill dyd affray,                                    25
  So that this crag and scroggis wirschippit thai.
  In ȝon schaw, on this woddy hillis top
  That skowgit is with mony buskis crop,
  Quod Evander, tharon a god dois dwell,
  Bot quhat god at he be can na man tell:                             30
  My pepill that bene cummyn from Arcaid
  Wenys thai saw ȝonder, as thai me said,
  Gret Jove hym self, as he ful oft at large
  Dyd schake his tawbart, or his beknyt targe,
  And with his rycht hand dyd assembill and steir                      5
  The watry clowdis, that makis thundris beir.
  And forthir eik he said ontill Enee,
  Ȝon twa town stedis thou behaldis, quod he,
  With barmkyn down bet and euery wall,
  Of forfaderis thai bene memoriall:                                  10
  This cite beldit our ald fader Janus,
  And ȝonder cite fundit Saturnus:
  Janiculum this hecht, myne awin leif brother,
  And Saturnya clepit was that other.
    Amangis thame with sic carpying and talk,                         15
  Towart Evandrus pur lugyng thai stalk:
  The catal eik behald thai raik on raw,
  And in that sted thar pasturand thai saw,
  Quhar now in Rome is the cheif merkat placis,
  Baith squeil and low in thai ilk plentuus gatis                     20
  Quhilk sum tyme hecht Caryne, fair and large,
  Quhar the howsis war like a turnyt barge.
  And quhen thai cummyn to the palice wer,

  And maid him sytting doun apon a bed,                                5
  That stuffit was with levys, and ourspred
  With the rouch skyn of a bustuus wild beir
  In Affrik bred befor mony a ȝer.

  Of hir auld malyce and iniquyte,                                     5
  Hir madyn Iris from hevin sendys sche

  Quhilk for the tyme was with all his rowt
  Amyd ane valle wondyr lovn and law,
  Sittand at eys within the hallowyt schaw                            10
  Of god Pilumnus, hys progenitor.
  Thamantis douchtir knelys hym befor,
  I meyn Iris, this ilk fornamyt maid,
  And with hir rosy lippys thus hym said:
    Turnus, behald on cace reuoluyt the day,                          15
  And of hys fre will sendys the, perfay,

  That burgh. But not eneuch; for farther syne
  To the extreme citeis of Tuscany
  In mont Corythus haldys he in hy,                                   10
  And doys assembill the wild lauboreris,

  Quhat dredis thou? now tyme is to prik hors,
  Now tyme fortill assay ȝour cartis and fors.
  Haue done, mak na mar tary nor delay,                               15
  Set on thar strenthis sone, gif thame affray.
  Quod sche; and tharwith, in hys presens evin,
  With equale weyngis flaw vp in the hevin,
  Vndre the clowdis schapand, quhar scho went,
  A gret rane bowe of diuers hewys ment.                              20
    The ȝong man knew hir weill, and hastely
  Vp baith hys handis hevis to the sky,
  With sic wordis followand, as scho dyd fle:
  Iris, thou bewte of the hevynnys hie,
  Throw all the clowdis and thir skyis brovn,                         25
  Quha hes the send to me in erth a dovn?
  Quhow is becummyn on this wys, quod he,

  And movand sternys in the lyftis syde.                              30
  So gret takynnys and reuelacions schaw

  Quhat evir thou be that callys to the weris,
  Thy command sal I obey, as efferis.
  And thar withall, with wordis augurall,                              5
  Eftir thar spayng cerymonys diuynal,
  Onto the flude onon furth steppis he,
  And of the stremys crop a litill we
  The watir lyftis vp intill his handis,
  Full gretumly the goddys, quhar he standis,                         10
  Besekand till attend to hys prayer,
  The hevynnys chargeyng with feil awowis seir.
    With this the ostis all in the plane feild
  Held furth arrayt, schynand vnder scheld.
  Men mycht behald full mony riall stedis,                            15
  Full mony pantyt targe and weirlyke wedis:
  Of giltyn geir dyd glytter bank and bus.
  The formast batale ledis Mesapus;
  The hyndmast ostis had in governyng
  Of Tyrrhyus the sonnys or childer ȝyng:                             20
  Turnus thar duke rewlys the myddill ost,
  With glave in hand maid awful feir and bost;
  Thame till array raid turnand to and fro,
  And by the hed alhaill, quhar he dyd go,

  In sik ordour furth haldis his menȝe,

  In hys deip trowch now flowys esely:                                30
  Or as vmquhile the fertill flude, Nylus,
  Ourfletand all the feildis, bank and bus,

  Returnys swagit to hys auld passage.




CAP. II.

  _Turnus segis the Troianys in gret ire,
  And all thar schippis and navy set in fyre._


  Be this the Troianys in thar new cite                                5
  A dusty sop vprysand gan do se,
  Full thik of stowr vp thryngand in the ayr,
  And all the feildis myrknyt mair and mair.
  Caycus first cryis, as he war wod,
  Dovn from the hie garrat quhar he stude;                            10
  O citesanys, how gret ane ost, quod he,
  Is lappit in ȝone dusty stew I se!
  Swith hynt ȝour armour, tak ȝour wapynnys all,
  Bryng hydder dartis, speil vp on the wall,
  Our ennemys cummys at hand, but dowt.                               15
  Hay, hay, go to! than cry thai with a schowt,
  And with a huge bruyt Troianys at schort
  Thar wallys stuffyt, and closyt euery port.
  For sa Eneas, maste expert in armys,
  At hys departing, dredand for thir harmys,                          20
  Gaif thame command, gif thai assalȝeit wer,
  Or hys returnyng, be hard fortoun of weir,
  That thai ne suld in batale thame array,
  Nor in the plane thar ennemys assay:
  Bot bad thai suld alanerly withhald
  Thar strenth within thar fowseis, as he wald,
  And kepe thar wallys forsely and weill,                              5
  With fowcy dichis and wapynnys styfe of steill.
  Tharfor, all thocht baith schame and felloun ire
  Thar breistis had enflambyt hait as fyre.
  In the plane feild on thar famen to set,
  Ȝit neuertheles thar portis haue thai schet,                        10
  Fortill obey the command of Enee;
  On boss turrettis and on towris hie
  Enarmyt stude thar fays till abyde.
    Turnus the chiftane on the tother syde
  Come to the cite, or that ony wist,                                 15
  Furth fleand swipperly, as that hym best list,
  Befor the ost, quhilk went bot esy pas:
  With hym a twenty chosyn men he has;
  Apon a sterand steid of Trace he sat,
  Of cullour dapill gray and wail fat,                                20
  Full hie rysand abuf his knychtly hed
  Hys goldin helm, with tymbrel al blude rede.
  Go to, ȝyng gallandis, quha that list, quod he,
  Thar ennemys assailȝe first with me:
  And, with that word, threw a dart in the air,                       25
  As he to geif batale all redy war,
  Syne in plane feild with browdyn baneris gay
  Bargane to byde drew hym till array.
  Hys feris all ressauyt the clamour hie,
  And followand thar chiftane, he and he,                             30
  The bruyt rasyt with grisly sound attanys,
  And gan to mervell the dolf hartit Troianys,
  That durst nocht, as thame semyt, in plane feild
  Thame self aventour, nor ȝit with sper and scheld
  Mach with thar famen in patent bargane,                              5
  Bot hald thame in thar strenthis euery ane.
  And all commovit, brym, and full of ire,
  Baith heir and thar Turnus the grevyt syre
  Went on horsbak, seirsand abowt the wall
  Every dern way and secret passagis all,                             10
  Gyf ony entre or tocome espy
  He myght, fortill assail the cite by.
  Lyke as we se, wachand the full scheip fald,
  The wild wolf ourset with schowris cald
  Of wynd and rane, at myddis of the nycht,                           15
  Abowt the bowght plet all of wandis tyght
  Brays and gyrnys; tharin bletand the lammys
  Full sovirly liggis vnder thar dammys:
  He brym and felloun his rage and furour
  Aganys the absentis, reddy to devour,                               20
  Rasys in ire, for the wod hungris lyst;
  Hys wysnyt throt, havand of blude sic thrist,
  Gendris of lang fast sic ane appetyte
  That he constrenyt is in extreme syt.
  Nane other wys, the feirfull fervent ire                            25
  In Turnus breist vpkyndillis hait as fyre,
  Seand thir wallys and fortressis attanys;
  The huge ennoy byrnys hym throu the banys,
  Imagynand by quhat resson or way
  Hys ennemys he mycht wyn till assay,                                30
  And on quhat wys the Troianys fra thar strenth
  He mycht expell, and in plane feild on lenth
  Mak thame to ische in patent batale place.
  And as he musand was heiron, per cace,
  The navy of thar schippys he dyd invaid,                             5
  That fast by jonyt to the wall was layd,
  With dychys and with fowseis dern abowt,
  In the flude watir, as neir owt of dowt:
  Quham fra he had espyit, but abaid
  At hys feris, quhilkis wilfull war and glaid,                       10
  Eftir the fyre and kyndillyng dyd he cry,
  And in hys awin handis hyntis vp in hy
  A blesand fyrebrand of the fyrryn tre.
  Than byssely Rutilyanys, he and he;
  So the presens of Turnus dyd thame steir,                           15
  That euery man the rekand schydis in feir
  Rent fra the fyris, and on the schippis slang:
  The semys crakkis, the watir byssyt and sang,
  The tallownyt burdis kest a pikky low,
  Vpblesis ourloft, hechis, wrangis, and how;                         20
  Quhill myxt with reik the fell sparkis of fyre
  Heich in the air vpglydis byrnand schire.




CAP. III.

  _Quhou the fyre was expellit fra the navye,
  The schippis translait in nymphis or goddessis of see._


  Say me, O Musys, reherses and declare,
  Quhilk of the Goddis sa cruel flammys sayr
  Held from Troianys? quha sa vehement fyre

  The deid is auld forto beleif or wry,
  Bot the memor remanys perpetualy.

  And gan do beld his schippis vp ilkane

  With sikkynd wordis, sayand; My child deir,

  Grant thy belovit moder bot a thing,

  Apon the top of Gargarus, quod sche,                                15
  Thar grew a fyr wod, the quhilk into dante

  Quhar that the Phrygianys maid me sacrifice;
  Ful weill me lykyt thar to walk oft sys,                            20

  Fortill support the mysteris of hys navy.                           25
  And now the dowtsum dreid, for the ilk quhy,
  Full pensyve haldis me and doith constrene:

  Be admittit this a time, be the leste,                              30
  So that tha schippis be nevir mair ourset
  With contrar curs, nor ȝit with storm dovn bet;
  Quharby thai may haue sum avale, quod sche,
  At thai vmquhill grew in our hillys hie.
  Hyr son, the quhilk rewlys at hys lykyng                             5

  Quhou art thou thus agane the fatis amovyt?
  Or quharto axis thou to thir, quod he,
  With mortale handis wrocht of stokkis and tre,                      10
  That is to say, thir schippis so habill to faill,
  That lesum war thai suld be immortale?
  And that Enee, in dedly corps onsure,

  And thar duke Troiane careit our the see

  Alsmony of thame as than hes eschaipe
  The wally fludis sall I turn and schaip
  Furth of thar mortale formys corruptabill,
  And sall command thame forto be mair habill
  From thens forthwart, as immortale, quod he,                        25
  In Nymphes turnyt and Goddessys of see;
  Lyke as Nereus douchter, Clotho gay,
  And Galathea, throw fomy fludis gray
  Scheryng with braid brestis delytabill.
  Quod Jupiter: and till hald ferm and stabill,                       30
  Be Stix the flude, Pluto hys broderis see,
  Hys godly aith and promys sworn hes he;
  Be that ilk pykky laik with brays blak,
  And laithly sworlys, till kepe at he spak

  The hevynnys all maid trymmyll at hys likyng.
    Tharfor the day that he by promys set
  Is now at hand, and the ful tyme of det,
  By the werd sisteris schaip, is now compleit;
  Quhen Turnus thus in hys iniuryus heit                              10
  Admonyst hes hys pepill, and commandis,
  With dry schydis and with hait fyre brandis,
  The moder of Goddis by sik flambys fell
  Furth of hir hallowyt schippis to expell.
  At this tyme first apperis in thar syght                            15
  A new takynnyng of gret plesand lycht,
  And a braid schynand clowd thai dyd aspy
  Cum from the est, rynnand our all the sky;
  The rowtis eik onone thai gan behald
  Of Ideanys, tha wightis that in the hald                            20
  Ar of the moder of the Goddis clos;
  Dovn throu the air eik come a feirful voce,
  And fillit all the ostis baith atanys
  Of Troiane pepill and Rutilianys,
  Sayand; Troianys, dreid na thing, haist ȝou nocht                   25
  Fortill defend my schippis, albeit ȝe mocht,
  For that caus tak na wapynnys in ȝour handis:
  For rather, now as that the mater standis,
  Sal it be lefull Turnus fyre the see,
  Or that he byrn my bargis maid of tre.                              30
  O ȝe my schippys, now to ȝou I say,
  Go fre at large quhar ȝou list away,
  Go furth and swym as Goddessis of the see;
  The moder of Goddis commandis so tobe.
  And, wyth that word, als tyte furth from the bra                     5
  Ilk barge bownys, cuttyand hir cabyll in twa;
  Lyke delphyn fysch onon as thai tuke kepe,
  Thar snowtis dowkand held vnder the deip.

  With als feill virgyne facis vpsprang thai,                         10
  And throu the fludis, quhar thame list, dyd fair,
  Quhou mony steill stammyt bargis that ayr

  Mesapus musyng can withdraw on dreich,                              15
  Seand hys stedis and the horssis skeich;
  And eik the ryver brayt with hays sovnd,

  As thocht hys curs dyd stop and step abak.

  Thir monstruus takynnys at ȝe se, perfay,
  Sekis mischeif to the Troianys, said he;
  And by this way gret Jupiter, as ȝe se,
  Hes now byreft thar help and confidens,
  Quharby thai wont war to fle for defens:                            30
  Now nowder Rutyliane fyre nor swerdis dynt
  May thai withstand, for all thar fors is tynt.
  Sen that thai may not eschape by the see,
  Nor hes na maner hope away to fle,
  The maist half of the Troiane help is lost;                          5
  This land is in our power, feld and cost;
  So that thai sal na wys eschape our brandis,
  Quhou mony thousand douchty men of handis

CAP. IV.

  _Heir Nysus carpis to his frend Eurilly,
  Till vndyrtak ane aventur onsilly._


  The Troianys, from thar fortres quhar thai stude
  All thar deray beheld and vnderstude,
  And baith with armour and with wapynnys brycht
  The towr hedys thai stuffyt all that nyght;
  And feill tymys in hasty effeir for dreid                            5
  The portis vissy thai, gyf ocht war neid,
  And drawbriggis befor the ȝettis vprasyt,
  Junct to the wallys, at thai suld nocht be trasyt;
  And euery man stud reddy in hys geir
  Enarmyt weill, and in his hand a speir.                             10
  Mnestheus stern, and eik Serestus stowt,
  Ful bissy war to walk and go abowt,
  Tyll ordinance forto put every thing;
  For thame Eneas, at his departyng,
  Had deput rewlaris to hys ȝong son deir,                            15
  And master capitanys of hys ost in weir,
  Gyf so betyd ony aduersyte,
  Or aventour, befor hys returne.
  Ane hail legioun about the wallis large
  Stude wachyng, bodyn with bow, speir, and targe:                    20
  The danger was by cuttys sone decyde,
  At euery corner quha, or quha, suld byde;
  And euery man his curs abowt dyd sleip,
  Quhil that his fallow had his ward to keip.
    Nisus, Hirtacus son, that tyme was set,
  As for hys stand, to byde and kepe the ȝet,
  As he that was in armys bald and stowt,
  Ane the maist valȝeant intill all that rowt;
  Quham Ida hys moder, ane huntryce,                                   5
  In falloschip send with Ene ful wys:
  To cast dartis nane sa expert as he,
  Nor forto schoyt swyft arrowys half sa sle.
  Euryalus, hys fallow, stude hym by,
  Of all Eneas ost nane mair gudly,                                   10
  Nor ȝit mar semly cled in Troiane armys,
  Stowt, of hie curage, dredand for na harmys:
  Hys florist ȝouth ravest hys vissage ȝyng,
  Ȝit nevir schavyn, with pilis newly spryng.
  To thir twa was a will in vnyte,                                    15
  A lust, and mynd in vniformyte:
  Sammyn thai ȝeid to mete, to rest, or play,
  And baith togidder in batale ruschit thai;
  Now sammyn eik thai war in statioun set,
  As baith in feir to kepe the common ȝet.                            20
    Nisus thus spekis, O brothir myne Ewrylly,
  Quhiddir gif the Goddis, or sum spretis sylly,
  Movys in our myndis this ardent thochtfull fyre,
  Or gif that euery mannis schrewit desyre
  Be as his God and Genyus in that place,                             25
  I wait nevir how it standis; bot this lang space
  My mynd movys to me, heir as I stand,
  Batale or sum gret thyng to tak on hand.
  I knaw not to quhat purpos is it drest,
  Bot be na way may I tak eys nor rest.                               30
  Behaldis thou not so surely, but affray,
  Ȝon Rutylianys thame haldis glaid and gay?
  Thar fyris now begynnys schyne full schire;
  Sowpyt in wyne and sleip baith man and syre
  At quyet lugyng ȝondyr at thar will;                                 5
  Queym silens haldis the large feildis still.
  Considir this profundly, I the pray,
  Quhat suld I dreid, quhat thinkis thou, now say.
  Baith common pepill and the heris bald
  To bryng agane Eneas ful fane thai wald;                            10
  Langyng ful sair eftir hys hame cummyng,
  And of hys mynd to haue sure witteryng,

  In sik a cace, me think, na ma thar nedis,

  Of new renown, quhilk brynt hym hait as fyre,                       20
  And half eschamyt of this bodword glaid,
  Thus til hys best belovyt fallow said:
  Nisus broder, in souerane actis hie,
  For ony caus, quhou may thou refus me
  With the to go in falloschip as feir?                               25
  Suld I the send allane in sik danger?
  My fader, Opheltes, the quhilk all hys days
  The weris hantit, nevir apon that ways
  Instrukkit me, nor tawcht sik cowardy.
  Was I not lernyt to hant chevalry                                   30
  Amyd the Grekis brag, and Troiane weris?
  Haue I me born with the, at thou afferis
  Off my curage? the maist dowchty Enee,
  And of fortoun to the last extremyte,
  Haue I not followyt, refusand na pyne?                               5
  Heir is, heir is, within this corps of myne,
  A forcy spreit that doith this life dispys,
  Quhilk reputtis fair to wissyll, apon sik wys,
  With this honour thou thus pretendis to wyn,
  This mortale stait and life that we bene in.                        10
    Nisus answeris; forsuyth, my broder dyng,
  Of the, God wait, ȝit dred I nevir sic thing;
  For so to think in faith onlefull wer.
  So hail and feir mot salf me Jupiter,
  And bryng me sownd agane with victory,                              15
  As euer ȝit sic consait of the had I.
  To wytnes draw I that ilk God, quod he,
  With frendly eyn quhilk dois ws heir and se,
  And in my mynd first movit this consait.
  Bot gif that so betyde, as weill ȝe wait                            20
  In sic aventouris thar bene dangeris seir,
  Be hard fortoun or aventour of weir,
  Or goddys dispositioun happin it fall,
  My will was the to salue fra perrellis all:
  Thy florist ȝouth is mair worthy to leif                            25
  Than forto put in danger of myscheif.
  I wald alsso at hame sum frend haue had

  Or fra me reft the lyfe, and sa withhald,

  And lay in grave, eftir our Troiane gys;
  Or, gyf fortoun wald suffir on na wys

  With obsequeis to do for corps absent,                               5
  And in my memor vp a tumbe to stent.

  For common weill and materis hie befell,
  Consideryng wisly quhat ado thar was,

  Thar erand was worth audiens and of price.
  Ascanyus first, seand thar hasty way,
  Admittit thar desire, and bad thame say.                            20
  Than this Nisus, Hirtacus son, thus said:

  Quhilk I ȝou tell may nocht considerit be
  With sik as ws, nor men sa ȝong of ȝheris,

  The Rutilianys, ourset with sleip and wyne,
  Lyggis sowpit, fordoverit, drunk as swyne:
  To set apon thame, and await with skaith,                            5
  The place surely we haue espyit baith,
  Quhilk reddy may ful esely be get
  In ȝondir forkyt way, strekis fra the ȝet
  Down to the seys cost the nerrest went;
  Quhar the fyris fast falȝeis, neir owt brynt,                       10
  So that the blak reik dyrknys all the air.
  Gif that ȝe suffir wald, as I said ayr,
  That we mycht vse this oportunyte
  Quhilk fortoun has ws grant, sone suld ȝe se

  And hyddir brocht in schort quhile eftir syne,
  With ryche spulȝe, and mekill slauchter maid.
  We knaw the way thidder full weill, he said,
  And all the watyr of Tibyr vp and down;
  In dyrk valeys oft we saw the town,                                 20
  As we by custum oft the huntyng hantit.

  Of agit man, and eik the curage wight,

  To beir hys fader, twychand hys ententis:

  And all for nocht amang the clowdis flaw.
    Furth ischit thai, and by the fowcyis wentis,                      5
  In silens of the dyrk nycht, amangis the tentis
  And perellus pailȝeonys, to thame ennemy,

  Bot netheles, or ony skaith thai hynt,
  The ded of mony was thar douchty dynt.                              10
  Apon the gyrs, ourset witht sleip and wyne,
  Fordoverit, fallyn down als drunk as swyne,
  The bodeys of Rutylianys heir and thar

  Or than amangis the quhelys and the thetis;
  All sammyn lay thar armour, wyne, and metys,
  Baith men and cartis myddillyt all our ane.
  With ane bas voce thus Nysus spak agane:                            20
  Ewrialus, the mater now thus standis,
  Forto be stowt and forcy of our handis;
  Thys is our passage, quhilk way we mon wend.
  Thy part salbe to kepe and to defend
  That nane onset cum on ws at the bak;                               25
  Spy far about, tharto gude tent thou tak.
  I sall befor mak voyd passage and way,
  And the convoy throu a large streit away.
  Rehersand this, onon he held hym clos,
  So that na noys mycht thar be hard or voce:                         30
  And tharwith eik with drawyn swerd in pres
  He can assail the pompus Rhamnetes,
  Quhilk lay, percace, slepand soft and sownd
  On prowd tapetis spred apon the grond;
  A kyng he was, and a spa man, suyth to sayn,                         5
  To Turnus kyng mast trast auguriane:
  Bot with hys diuinatioun nor augury

  Thre of hys seruandis, that fast by hym lay,

  And quellyt ane to Remus was squyer.

  And with hys swerd hys nek, hyngand on syde,                        15
  In twane hes hakkyt; and the sammyn tyde
  Thar lordis hed, I meyn this said Rhamneyt
  Of smytis he, quhill all the bed wolx weyt:
  Lyke a ded stok the corps wantand the hed
  Lay bullerand, al besprent with sprayngis red,                      20
  And als the erth grew warm with teppet blude.
  Attour he stekit hes eik, quhar he stude,
  Twa forcy men, Lamus and Lamyrus,
  And als the lykly ȝong child, Serranus,
  That all the fornycht in ryot and in play                           25
  Had spendyt as he lyst, and now he lay
  With membris strekit, and plesand vissage brycht,
  Ourset with god Bachus mekill of myght:
  Ful happy and weill fortunat had he be,
  In sport and gam on the sam wys gif he                              30
  All the remanent of that nycht had spent,
  Quhil the lycht day, and tyl hym self tane tent.
  Lyke as the empty lyoun, lang onfed,
  Be nychtis tyde quhen all folk sleip in bed,
  Trubland the fald full of silly scheip;                              5
  The wod rage of hys hungir is so deip
  That he constrenyt is sik wys to fair:

  The tendir bestis, that for awfull feir
  Of hys presens dar nowder bleyt nor steir;                          10
  He rummysis with bludy mowth and brays.
  So dyd Ewrilly, and none other ways,
  And na les slauchter maid he in the plane,
  Of ire inflambyt in his wod brane.

  By quhilk resson thair namys ar onknaw,
  He ombeset and put to confusioun:
  And Fadus syne, with Hesebus dang he down,
  And Arabys also, onwarnystly;
  And Rhetus eik, lay walkand hard thame by,                          20
  Behaldand all thar sterage and deray;
  Bot, of the stowt Ewrialus for affray,
  Behynd a wyne bote or a pype hym hyd:
  Quham Eurialus, as the cace betyd,
  Keppyt on hys swerdis poynt, that all the blaid                     25
  Hyd in hys cost vp to the hyltis glaid:
  To ded he duschis down bath styf and cald,
  And vp the purpour spreit of lyf he ȝald,
  And blude and wyne mixt he can furth schaw,
  At he last drank owt ȝeskis in the ded thraw.                       30
  And, by sik slyght full brym, thus he enforcis
  To mak huge slauchtir of onweldy corpcis,
  Etlyng wightly to the nixt stude fast by.
  Thar as Mesapus feris all dyd ly,
  And the last fyris almaste quynchit owt,                             5
  The hors, per ordour, tyit weill abowt,
  Etand thar meit he mycht behald and se:
  Quham schortly Nysus bad ses and lat be;
  For he persauyt Eurialus by his feris
  Had our gret lust to slauchter, and dangeris                        10
  Persauyt nocht quhilkis war apperand eft:

  For the day lycht, quhilk is to ws onfrend,

  Of massy syluyr, lyand heir and thare,

  Salf that Eurialus with hym tursyt away
  The rial trappouris, and myghty patrellys gay,
  Quhilkis war Rhamnetes stedis harnessyng;                           25
  And, for the mair remembrance in takynnyng,

  The pendentis wrocht of burnyst gold maste fyne,

  And send it syne to ane Remulus hes he,

  In syng of frendschip and ferm acquentans;                           5
  Thus athir absent jonyt allyans;

  Apon hys hed onon buklyt hes he.
  Furth of the tentis with this bownyt thai,
  And fra thar fays held the sovyr way.

  In the meyn quhile, as this other army

  From Lawrentum, kyng Latinus cite,
  War horsmen sent to Turnus, forto se
  Quhat he plesyt, and the kyngis entent

  And be this cummyn war to the distens

  Quhar as on far towart the left hand thai

  For the brycht helm in twynkland starny nycht

  Quhilk he, onwar, persauyt nocht, allace!
  And as thai scars war thus aspyit on cace,

  Said, stand fallowis; and cryis with a schowt:
  Quhat is the caus of ȝour cummyng, said he,                         15
  That rydis thus enarmyt? quhat ȝe be,

  The wod was large, and rowch of buskis ronk,                        25
  And of the blak ayk schaddowis dym and donk,
  Of breris ful, and thyk thorn ronnys stent;

  Quhat for myrknes, thik buskis, branch, and breir,
  And weght also of the new spulȝeit geir,

  And as he stude at that sted, eftir syne

  Quhar, for the tyme, this forsaid Latyn kyng
  Hys hors at pastour held in stabillyng,                             10

  In quhat part of this land the left haue I?
  Or quhar sall I the seik? O wailaway!                               15
  Tharwith this ilk wilsum perplexit way

  Throw the dern wod dissaitfull and onplane;
  Quhil, at the last, amang rank buskis he
  Errit by the way, becaus he myght nocht se.                         20
  The hors stampyng and the dyn he heris,
  The wordis and the takynnys come to hys erys
  Of thame quhilk at persewit hym at the bak.
  A lytil space eftir tent gan he tak,
  And hard a scry: harknand quhat that suld be,                       25
  Eurilly takyn in handys dyd he se;
  Quham the dissaitfull onbekend dern way,
  The myrk nycht, and the hasty dowtsum fray,
  Betrasyt had, that all the mekill rowt,
  Or he was war, hym lowkyt rownd about.                              30
  Full gret debait he maid, as that he mocht;
  Ourset he was, defens was all for nocht.
    Quhat mycht than silly Nysus do or say?
  Be quhat fors or wapynnys dar he assay
  Forto deliuer hys tendir cousyng deir?                               5
  Suld he or not aventour hym self heir,
  And rusch amyd hys ennemys in that sted,
  To procur in haist by wondis ane honest ded?
  Vprasys he onon hys arm bakwart,
  To thraw a gevillyng, or a castyng dart,                            10
  And, lukand vpwart towart the cleir moyn,
  With afald voce thus wys he maid hys boyn:
  O Latonya, Goddes of mekill myght,
  Mastres of woddis, bewte of sternys brycht,
  Be thou present, and send me thy supple,                            15
  Addres my wark, be directrix, said he:
  Gif euer that Hirtacus, my fader deir,
  Offrit for me sum gift at thy alter;
  Or gif that I of my huntyng and pray
  Ekyt thy honour ony maner way,                                      20
  Or, at thy standart knoppit post of tre,

  Thoil me to trubbill this gret rowt of men,                         25
  Do dres my dartis in this wilsum den,
  So that my schote and myssour may go rycht
  Throw the dyrk ayr and silens of the nycht.
    Thus sayand, with all fors of hys body
  The grundyn dart he leyt do glyde in hy.                            30
  The fleand schaft the nycht schaddoys devydis,
  And rycht forgane him on the tother sydis
  It smate Sulmonys scheild, hang on his bak,
  Quharin the querral al in schuldir brak;
  Bot with the dynt the rynde is revyn swa,                            5
  Hys hart pipis the scharp hed persyt in twa.
  Down duschis he in ded thraw all forlost,

  Hys ferys lukis about on euery syde,
  To se quharfra the grundyn dart dyd glyde.

  And baldar of this chance swa with hym gone,                        15
  Ane other takill assayt he onon,
  And with a sownd smate Tagus, but remede,
  Throu athir part or tymplis of his hed;
  In the harn pan the schaft he hes affixt,

  The felloun capitane, Volscens, neir wod wendis,
  Seand na man quham of to get amendis:

  For quha that threw the dartis saw he nocht.

  With thy hait blude for baith twa sal aby
  The pane for this myscheif; and, with that word,
  He ran apon Euryll with drawyn sword.

  Nor na langar in dern hym hyde he mycht,
  Nor of his frend behald sa reuthfull syght:
  Me, me, ȝe sla; lo, I am heir, he said,
  That dyd the dede; turn hidder in me ȝour blaid
  And swerdis all, O ȝe Rutilyanys!                                    5
  All be my slycht now ȝour feris slane is:

  Sik wordis said he: for on sic maner,
  And sa strangly, his frend and fallow deir,
  That sa myschancy was, belovit he,
  That rather for hys life him self list de.
  Bot thar was na remedy nor abaid:                                   15

  Throu owt hys cost: allace, the harmys smart!
  That mylk quhite breist is persyt to the hart.
  Down ded ruschit Eurialus right thar,
  The blude bruschand outour his body fair,                           20
  And on hys elbok lenand a litill on wry,
  Hys hed and hals bowys he hevely.
  Lyke as the purpour flour in fur or sewch,
  Hys stalk in two smyt newly with the pleuch,
  Dwynys away, as it doith faid or de;                                25
  Or as the chesbo hedis oft we se

  Not amovit, as na thing him had alit:
  And euer his schynand swerd about him swang,
  Quhil at the last in Volscens mouth he thrang,
  As he, forgane him standand, cryit and gapit.
  Allace, quhat reuth was it he not eschapit!                         10
  For he deand bereft his fa the life;
  Stekit and hurt sa oft with speir and knyfe,
  Fell down abuf his frendis ded body,
  Quhar best him likit ded to rest and ly.
    O happy baith, O fortunat and dyng!                               15

CAP. X.

  _Heir ȝyng Ascanyus the strang Numanus slew,
  Quhilk wordis owtragyus to the Troianys schew._


  Ascanyus this ilk tyme, as is said,
  That wont was with his schot bot to invaid
  The wild bestis, quhilkis cowth do nocht bot fle,
  First heir in bargane leyt swyft arrowys fle;
  And by hys handis slew strang Numanus,                               5
  That was to surname clepit Remulus,
  Had laitly Turnus ȝyngast systir wed,
  As for hys spows, and brocht ontill hys bed.
  This ilk Numanus Remulus, in that sted,
  Befor the frontis of the batell ȝeyd,                               10
  Furth schawand mony diuers sawys seir,

  Rycht prowd and hely in his breist and hart
  That newlyngis of the kynrik was a part
  To him befall; his gret estait this wys                             15
  Woustand he schew with clamour and lowd cryis:
    Aschame ȝe nocht, Phrigyanys, that twys taik is,
  Tobe inclosyt amyd a fald of stakis,
  And be assegit agane sa oft sys
  With akyn spilis and dikis on sik wys?                              20
  Schame ȝe not to prolong ȝour lyvis? said he.
  Thir venquyst cowart wightis behald and se,
  That dar our spousage into batale craif!
  Quhat wild dotage so maid ȝour hedis raif?
  Or quhat onthrifty God in sic foly

  Heir ar not the slaw weirmen Atrydes,
  Nor the fenȝear of fair speche Vlixes.

  Or than in batal bettis citeis down.
  In euery age with irne grath ar we bown,
  And passand by the plewys, for gad wandis,

  Quhar as the quhissill rendris soundis seir,

  And bos schawmys of turnyt buschboun tre

  Herand sa hie avant of pompus pryde,
  And sik dispyt blawyn owt apon hys syde.
  Hys bow with horsis sennonys bend hes he,

  And tasand vp his armys far in twyn,                                25
  Thus onto Jove lawly dyd begyn
  To mak hys first petitioun and prayer:
  Omnipotent hie Jupiter, me heir
  Assist to this hardy commancement!
  My self onto thy templis sal present                                30
  Solempnyt gyftis, maste gudly may be get,
  And eik befor thyne altar sall I set
  A ȝoung bullok of cullour quhite as snaw,
  With goldin schakaris hys forhed arrait on raw;
  The best salbe full tydy, tryg, and wight,                           5
  With hed equale till hys moder on hyght,
  Can all reddy with hornys fuyn and put,
  And scrape or skattyr the soft sand with his fut.
  The fader of hevin exceppit hys prayer,
  And, on that part quhar the lift was maist cleir,                   10
  Towart the left hand maid a thundyrryng:
  All sammyn soundyt the dedly bowys stryng.
  Quhyrrand smertly furth flaw the takill tyte,
  Quyte throw the hed the Remulus dyd smyte;
  The grundyn steill outthrowch hys tympillys glaid.                  15
  Hald on thy ways in haist, Ascanyus said,
  Thy self to loif, knak now scornfully
  With prowd wordis all at standis by.
  Sik boydword heir the twys takyn Troianys
  Sendis for hansell to Rutylianys.                                   20
    Thus far spekis Ascanyus, and na mair.
  Bot the Troianys rasyt a scry in the ayr
  With rerd and clamour of blithnes, man and boy,
  That to the starnys thar curage sprang for joy,
  Ascanyus extolland abuf the skyis.                                  25
  And, as thai mak this ryot on sik wys,
  Down from the regioun of the hevin tho

  Apon a clowd sittand quhar he wald,
  The ostis of Italianys can behald,                                  30
  And eik new Troys cite, with cheir glaid
  Till Iulus the victor thus he said:
  Eik and continew thy new vailȝeand dedis,
  Thou ȝong child; for that is the way the ledis
  Vp to the starnys and the hevynnys hie,                              5
  O thou verray Goddis ofspring, quod he,

  This litill town of Troy, that heir is wrocht,

    And sayand thus, from the heich hevin als tyte
  Discendis he, movand the hailsum ayr,                               15
  And to the child Ascanyus socht rycht thar:
  Hys figur changit that tyme as he wald

  And trasty kepar of hys chalmyr dur;
  Now had Ene committ to hym the cur
  For tyll attend apon Ascanyus ȝyng.
  Lyke to this ancyent Butes in al thyng
  Furth steppys Phebus, baith in voce and hew,                        25
  With lokkis quhite and armour na thing new,

  And sic wordis spak to Iulus ȝyng,

  With ardent mynd of bargane desyrus:                                30

  It may suffice, the nedis do na mair,

  And closyt queym the entre, and furth schet
  Without the port a gret sort of hys feris,
  In hard bargane amyd the mortal weris;
  And of hys ennemys sum inclosyt he,                                 15
  Ressavand all at thrang to the entre.
  A fuyll he was, and wytles in a thyng,

  So violently thryng in at the ȝet;
  Quham he onwar within the cite schet,                               20
  Lyke as ane rageand wild tyger onstabill

  That wonder fervent in hys furour grew,                             10
  Hys broderis slauchter to revenge in will,
  Thus austernly he spekis Turnus ontill:
    Thys is not queyn Amatais cheif cite,
  Suld the be geif into dowry, said he;
  Nor ȝit the myddis of Ardea cite bald,                              15
  Thi faderis burgh, Turnus, doith the withhald:
  Thou seys thy fays strenth and wallys wyde;

    Turnus agane, with curage blyth and glaid,
  Nocht abasyt, ful baldly to hym said:                               20
  My frend, begyn, gif thou hes hardyment,

  And hand for hand, gif at it be thy will,

  Ha! quod Turnus, sa sal thou not astart

  For he that aw this swerd, and wond sal wyrk,                        5

  And with that word, standand on hys typtays,

  Down with the dynt duschit the steil blaid keyn
  Amyd hys forhed, hard betwix hys eyn,                               10

  So large feild hys gowsty body tuke,
  That fer onbreid ourspred was all the plane,
  Hys armour sparkyt with hys blude and brane:
  Baith to and fra, apon hys schuldris tway,
  Hys hed clovyn in equale halfis lay.                                20
    Of dreidfull raddour trymlyng for affray,
  The Troianys fled right fast and brak away:
  And gif Turnus had than incontinent
  Ramembryt hym, and kauch in mynd to rent
  The lokkis vp, and oppyn the ȝettis wyde,                           25
  So that hys feris without the port that tyde
  Mycht haue entryt, and cummyn in the cite,
  The last day of the batale that had be,
  And latter finale end to the remanys
  Of Phrigiane folkis and pepil Troianys.                             30
  Bot sic ardent hie furour martyall,
  And of slauchter desire insaciable,
  Draif hym to follow thame that hym gaynstandis:
  And first he kyllit Phalarys with his handis,
  And ane other, that Gyges hecht, alssua,                             5
  Of quham the howchys bath he smate in twa;
  Syn speris rent and hynt vp all on raw,
  And at the flearis bakkis fast dyd thraw,
  That wondir was to se hym quhar he went,
  For Juno ekyt hys strenth and hardyment.                            10
  Syne ane Hales onto the corpsis ded
  In cumpany he ekyt in that sted;
  And Phegeas doun brytnys in the feld,
  Spetit throw owt the body and hys scheld;

  Quhilkis mysknew Turnus was within the wall,
  And to the bargan dyd thar feris call,
  Apon the grund onon al ded he layd,
  In bargan full expert: syne dyd invaid                              20
  With schynand swerd, hard at the dykis syde,
  Ane Lynceus, the quhilk the sammyn tyde
  Resistys, as he myght, with fell afferis,
  And eftir help cryis apon hys feris;
  Bot with a strake he smate hys nek in twa,                          25
  Baith helm and hed flaw far the body fra.
  And, eftir thir, ane Amycus he slew,
  That bayn had beyn to wild bestis enew;
  Was nane other mair happy nor expert
  To graith and til invnct a castyng dart,                            30
  And with vennom to garnys the steil hedis.
  By Turnus handis the ilk tyme done to ded is
  Eolus son, hait Clytius, the heynd,
  And Creteus also, was the Musys frend;
  Creteus, poet to Musys famyliar,                                     5
  That in hys mynd and breist all tymys bar

  And euermar hys maner and his gys                                   10
  Was forto syng, blason, and discryve,

CAP. XIII.

  _The Troianys set on Turnus dyntis rude,
  Quhill at he fled, and lap into the flude._


  At last Mnestheus and strang Serestus,
  The Troiane capitanys, herand quhow that thus
  Thar pepill slane war doun, dyd convene;                            15
  Thar feris fleand pail and wan haue thai sene,
  And thar cheif ennemy closyt in thar wallys.

  Quhar haue ȝe other strenth or forteres?
  O citesanys, behaldis heir expres
  Nane bot a man standand ȝou aganys,
  Closyt within ȝour dykis and wallys of stanys,

  And huge slauchter sal mak within ȝour tovn,
  Or sa feill valȝeand ȝyng capitanys kend,                            5
  Onresistit, thus down to hell sall send!
  O maste onworthy cowartis, ful of slewth,
  Of ȝour onselly cuntre haue ȝhe na rewth,
  Nor piete of ȝour ancyent Goddis kynd?
  Think ȝhe na lak and schame into ȝour mynd,                         10
  To do sa gret owtrage to strang Enee,
  In hys absens thus catyfly to fle?
    The Troianys by sik wordis as he said
  In curage grew, and fermly all abaid,
  Abowt thar faman flokkand in a rowt.                                15
  Turnus a litil, thocht he was stern and stowt,
  Begouth frawart the bargane to withdraw,
  And sattil towartis the ryveris syde alaw,
  Ay peys and peys, to that part of the tovn
  Was closyt with the ryver, rynnand dovn.                            20
  Troianys, that seand, the mar apertly
  Assalȝeit hym with mony schowt and cry,
  And thikkyt fast abowt hym inveroun.
  As quhen abowt the awfull wild lyoun,
  With thar invasibill wapynnys scharp and squar,                     25
  Ane multitude of men bilappyt war;
  And he full fers, with thrawin wlt, in the start,
  Seand the scharp poyntis, recullys bakwart:
  Bot, forto gif the bak, and fle away,
  Nowder hys greif nor curage suffir may;                             30
  And, thocht he wald, for all hys mekill mycht,
  Agane samony men and wapynnys brycht
  To pres fordwart may he cum na speid.
  Nane other wys Turnus, at sik a neid,
  Steppys abak with huly pays full still,                              5
  Hys mynd scaldand in greif and egir will:
  And forthir eik amyd hys fays he
  Twys ruschit in, and schuddrit the melle;
  And twys also that onrebutit knycht
  Endlang the wallys put thame to the flycht.                         10
  Bot al togidder, intyll ane convyne,
  Apon hym haill the town assemlyt syne,
  Nor Saturnus get, Juno, in that fyght
  Agane thame durst him minister strenth nor mycht;
  For Jupiter had from the hevynnys fair                              15
  Send dovn Iris, quhilk dwellis in the ayr,
  Onto hys spous and sister thar at hand
  Ful scharp chargis bryngis and command,
  Les than Turnus, quhou evir the chance befallis,
  Withdrew hym fra the fatale Troiane wallys:                         20
  Quharthrow this valȝeand campioun ȝong and keyn
  Nowder with his scheild sa mekil mycht sustene,
  Nor sic defens mak with his hand, as ayr.
  With dartis at him swakkit heir and thar
  On sik wys is he quhelmyt and confundyt,                            25
  That euer in ane hys bos helm rang and soundyt,
  Clynkand abowt hys halfheddis with a dyn:
  Hys sovir armour, strang, and na thyng thyn,
  Is brokkyn and byrsyt with feill stonys cast;
  So thik war dyntis, and strakis smyt so fast,                       30
  That of his helm down bettyn war the crestis;
  Sa sair the bosys of hys target prest is,
  Hys scheild na langar mycht sik rowtis sustene;
  The Troianys, with this Mnestheus, in thar teyn
  Dowblys thar dyntis at hym with speris cast,                         5
  As it had bene the hydduus thundris blast.
  Our all hys body furth ȝet the swait thik,
  Lyke to the trynland blak stremys of pyk;
  Ne gat he laser anys hys aynd to draw:
  The febillit brath ful fast can beit and blaw                       10
  Amyd hys wery breist and lymmys lasch.
  Than at the last, al suddanly, with a plasch,
  Harnes and al togiddir, quhar he stude,
  Him self he swakkis and lap into the flude.
  With giltyn stremys hym keppyt the ryver,                           15
  And bar hym vp abuf hys wallis cleir;
  Syne blithly careit to hys feris bedene,
  All blude and slauchter away was weschyn clein.




THE PROLOUG OF THE TENTH BUKE.


  He plasmatour of thingis vniuersall,
  Thou renewar of kynd, that creat all,
  Incomprehensibill thy warkis ar to consave,
  Quhilk grantyt hes to every wight to haue
  Quhat thing mast ganys onto hys governall.                           5

  Quhou mervellus beyn divisions of thy gracis,
  Distribut so to ilk thing in all placis!
  The son to schyne our all, and schaw hys lyght,
  The day to laubour, for rest thou ordanyt nycht;
  For diuers causys schupe seir sessonys and spacis.                  10

  Fresch veir to burgioun herbys and sweit flowris;
  The hait symmyr to nurys corn all howris,
  And breid all kynd of fowlys, fysch, and beste;
  Hervist to rendir hys frutis maste and leste;
  Wyntir to snyb the erth with frosty schowris.                       15

  Not at thou nedyt ocht, all thyng thou wrocht,
  Bot to that fyne thou maid all thing of nocht,
  Of thy gudnes tobe participant;
  Thy Godhed na rychar, nor ȝit mar skant,
  Nowthir now nor then, set thou ws wrocht and bocht.                 20

  Thy maist supreme indiuisibill substans,
  In ane natur thre personys, but discrepans,
  Regnand etern, ressauys nane accident;
  For quhy? thou art rycht at this tyme present
  It at thou was, and evir sal, but varians.                           5

  Set our natur God hes to hym vnyte,
  Hys Godhed incommixt remanys perfyte,
  The son of God havand verray naturis twane
  In a person, and thre personys all ane
  In deite, natur, maieste, and delyte.                               10

  The Son the self thing with the Fader is;
  The self substans the Haly Gaist, I wys,
  Is with thame baith; thre distinct personage,
  Ar, war, and be sall, euer of ane age,
  Omnipotent, a Lord, equale in blys.                                 15

  Quhilk souerane substans, in gre superlatyve,
  Na cunnyng comprehend may nor discryve;
  Nowther generis, generat is, nor doith proceid,
  Allane begynnar of euery thing, but dreid,
  And in the self remanys etern on lyve.                              20

  The Fader, of nane generat, creat, ne boir,
  Hys only Son engendris evirmor;
  Not makis, creatis, bot engendris all way
  Of hys substans; and all tyme of baith twa
  Procedis the Haly Gaist, equal in glor.                             25

  Of baith, from ane begynnyng, procedis he;
  So bene the warkis of the Trinite
  Maist excellent, and wondirfull to consave:
  Ȝit thame to traste the mair meryte we have,
  That be na manys rayson prevyt may thai be.                          5

  The Fader knawys hym self, quhilk knawlege spredis
  Be generatioun etern, that evir bredis
  Hys Son, hys word and wysdom eternall:
  Betwix thir twa is luf perpetuall,
  Quhilk is the Haly Gaist, fra baith procedis.                       10

  Not at the Faderis natur mynyst is,
  Of hys substans he generis his Son in blys;
  Ne so the Son of hys kynd is ybor,
  That he a part hes tharof, and na mor;
  Bot all he gevys hys Son, and all is hys.                           15

  The ilk thing he hym gevis, that he remanys:
  Thys syngill substans indifferently thus ganys
  To thre in ane, and ilk ane of the thre
  The sammyn thing is in a maieste,
  Thocht thir personys be seuerall in thre granys.                    20

  Lyke as the sawle of man is ane, we wait,
  Havand thre poweris distinct and separate,
  Vnderstandyng, rayson, and memor:
  Intelligens consideris the thing befor,
  Rayson discernys, memor kepis the consait.                          25

  As thai beyn in a substans knyt all thre,
  Thre personys ryngnys in a Deite.
  We may tak als ane other simylytude,
  Grosly the sammyn purpos to conclud;
  Flame, lycht, and hait, bene in a fyre we se.                        5

  Quhar euer the low is, lycht and heit bene thar;
  And had the fyre bene byrnand euermar,
  Evyr suld the flambe engendrit haue hys lyght,
  And of the byrnand low the flambys brycht
  Perpetualy suld heit haue sprung alquhar.                           10

  So generis the Fader the Son with hym etern,
  From baith procedis the Haly Gaist coetern.
  Thus rude exemplys and figuris may we geif;
  Thocht, God by hys awin creaturis to preif,
  War mar onliknes than liknes to discern.                            15

  Frend, farly nocht, na caus is to complene
  Albeit thy wyt gret God may nocht attene;
  For, mycht thou comprehend be thyne engyne
  The maist excellent maieste dyvyne,
  He mycht be reput a pretty God and meyn.                            20

  Consider thy raison is so febill and lyte,
  And hys knawlage profund and infynyte;
  Consider quhou he is onmensurabill:
  Hym, as he is, to knaw thou art not habill;
  It sufficis the beleif thy creid perfyte.                           25

  God is, I grant, in all thing nocht includyt;
  Gevis all gudnes, and is of nocht denudyt;
  Of hym hes all thing part, and he nocht mynyst;
  Hail he is alquhar, not diuidit, ne fynyst;
  Without all thing he is, and nocht excludit.                         5

  O Lord, thy ways beyn investigabill!
  Sweit Lord, thy self is sa inestimabill,
  I can write nocht bot wondris of thy mycht,
  That lawyt sa far thy maieste and hyght
  Tobe born man intill ane oxis stabill.                              10

  Thow tuke mankynd of ane onwemmyt maid,
  Inclosyt within a virginis bosum glaid,
  Quham all the hevynnys mycht nevir comprehend;
  Angellis, scheiphyrdis, and kyngis thy Godheid kend,
  Set thou in cryb betwix twa bestis was laid.                        15

  Quhat infynyte excellent hie bonte
  Abufe thy warkis all, in wonderfull gre!
  Lord, quhen thou man wrocht to thyne awyn ymage,
  That tynt him self throu hys fulych dotage,
  Thou man becam, and deit to mak hym fre.                            20

  Maid thou not man first president vnder the,
  To dant the bestis, fowlys, and fysch in see,
  Subdewit to him the erth, and all tharin;
  Syne paradice grantit hym and all his kyn,
  Gave him fre will, and power nevir to dee?                          25

  Enarmyt him with raison and prudence;
  Only bad hym kepe thyne obediens,
  And to hym suld all creaturis obey?
  Bitter was that fruyt for his ofspryng, and fey,
  Maid deth onknawin be fund, and lyfe go hens.                        5

  O thyne inestimabill luf and cheryte!
  Becam a thrall to mak ws bondis fre,
  To quykkyn thy sclavys tholyt schamfull ded maste fell.
  Blissyt be thou virginal frute, that hereit hell,
  And pait the pryce of the forbodin tre!                             10

  Thocht thou large stremys sched apon the rude,
  A drop had bene sufficient of thy blude
  A thousand warldis to haue redemyt, I grant;
  Bot thou the well of mercy wald nocht skant,
  Ws to provoik to lufe the, and be gude.                             15

  Our all this syne, thyne infynyte Godhed,
  Thy flesch and blude in form of wyne and bred,
  Tobe our fuyd of grace, in plege of glor,
  Thou hest ws geif, in perpetuall memor
  Of thy passioun and dolorus paynfull ded.                           20

  Quhat thankis dew or ganȝeld, Lord benyng,
  May I, maist wracht synfull catyve indyng,
  Rendir for this souerane peirles hie bonte?
  Sen body, saule, and all, I haue of the,
  Thou art my pryce, mak me thy praye condyng.                        25

  My makar, my redemar, and support,
  Fra quham all grace and gudnes cumis at schort,
  Grant me that grace my mysdedis til amend,
  Of this and all my warkis to mak gud end:
  Thus I beseik the, Lord, thus I exort.                               5

  From the begynnyng and end be of my muse:
  All other Jove and Phebus I refus.
  Lat Virgill hald hys mawmentis to him self;
  I wirschip nowder ydoll, stok, nor elf,
  Thocht furth I write so as myne autour dois.                        10

  Is nane bot thou, the Fader of Goddis and men,
  Omnipotent eternal Jove I ken;
  Only the, helply Fader, thar is nane other:
  I compt not of thir paygane Goddis a fudder,
  Quhais power may nocht help a haltand hen.                          15

  The scripture clepys the God, of Goddis Lord;
  For quha thy mandat kepys in ane accord
  Bene ane with the, not in substans, bot grace,
  And we our Fader the clepys in euery place:
  Mak ws thy sonnys in cherite, but discord.                          20

  Thow haldis court our cristall hevynnys cleir,

  Concord for ever, myrth, rest, and endles blys,
  Na feir of hell, nor dreid of ded, thar is
  In thy sweit realm, nor na kynd of ennoy,
  Bot all weilfair, eys, and euerlestand joy;
  Quhais hie plesance, Lord, lat ws neuer mys! Amen.                   5

CAP. I.

  _Quhou Jupiter the court of goddis dyd call,
  And Venus makis complaynt amangis thame all._


  On breid, or this, was warp and maid patent
  The hevynly hald of God omnipotent.
  The kyng of men and fader of goddis all
  Ane consale or a sessioun maid do call,
  Amang the spretis abufe and goddis gret,                             5
  Within hys sterrit hevyn and mylky set:
  Quharfra, amyd hys trone sittand full hie,
  Our all the erd he mycht behald and se
  The Troianys castellys, and the pepill Latyne.
  Down sat the Goddis in thar segis dyvyne,                           10
  The faldyn ȝettis baith vp warpyt braid;
  First Jove hym self begouth, and thus he said.
    O hevynly wightis, of gret power and mycht,
  Quhou is betyd ȝour myndis bene sa lycht,
  That ȝour decreit fatal and sentens hie                             15
  Retretit thus and turnyt bakwartis suld be?
  Or quhy with frawart myndis now of layt
  Aganys ȝour ressonabill oraclys ȝe debait?
  My will was not at the Italianys
  In batale suld concur contrar Troianys.
  Quhat maner discord be this at we se,                                5
  Expres agane our inhibitioun? said he:
  Quhat dreid or reuerens thame, or thame, hes movyt
  To ryn till armys, and rasys weir controvit?
  Or hes sic wys persuadyt to bargane,
  With bludy wapynnys rent, and mony slane?                           10
  Haist not the sesson to provoke nor prevene;
  Of batale cum sal detfull tyme bedene,
  Heireftir, quhen the fers burgh of Cartage
  To Romys boundis, in thar feirfull rage,
  Ane huge myscheif and gret qualm send sall,                         15
  And thyrll the hie montanys lyke a wall:
  Than war just tyme in wreth to mak debait,
  Than war the tyme to rug and reif thus gait.
  Now of sic thingis leif and desist; with me
  Glaidly do makis frendly amyte.                                     20
    A few wordis on this wys Jupiter said;
  Bot not in quhoyn wordis him answer maid
  The fresch goldyn Venus: O thou, quod sche,
  Fader of all, O eternal powste,
  Regnand abuse all men, and Goddis eik,                              25
  To the I cum, the rewthfully beseik,
  Sen thar nane other maieste bene, ne glor,
  That in sik neid may help ws to implor.
  Thow seys quhou, with bost and felloun feir,
  The Rutilianys makis gret derray and steir;                         30
  And quhou Turnus, pransand on semly stedis,
  Throw owt the ostis rydis in steill wedis;

  To salf Ene, hes thou not power and mycht

  And set in sted of that man, light as lynd,

  Quhidder was it we, or than Parys, that faltyt,

  Ombesegyt the cite of Spartha,
  And the queyn Heleyn reft and brocht awa?
  Or quhidder gif I evir into that weir

  Or ȝit that bargane stuffyt or bet, lat se,                         15

  Than had bene honest tyme, and ganand baith,

  And all the hevynly wightis dyd quhyspir and rown,                  25
  In opynyonys full diuers, vp and down:
  Lyke as first, or wyndis blast be persave,

  I sall me hald indifferent, the meyn gait,

  Nowder Troianys nor Rutilianys freith will I.
  Lat athir of thame thar awin fortoun stand by,
  And bruke thar wark thai haue begun; but faill,

  And laithly golf, to kepe all that he spak;
  And, til afferm hys aith, at hys lykyng
  The hevynnys all maid trymbill, for a syng.
    Thus endit was the consale, and al doyn,
  And Jupiter rays fra hys goldyn troyn:                              10
  Quham hevynly wightis amyddis thame with joy

  _Eneas fra the schippis landit his ost,

  In the meyn sesson, the Troiane Ene
  Begouth hys folkis from thar schippis hie                           10
  On bryggis and on plankis set on land:

  Bend vp ȝour ayris styth, and rays ȝour schippys,

  And with ȝour stelyt stevynnys, ane and all,                         5
  Thys ground onfrendly to ws and innimicall

  Na fors I not in sik port by this meyn
  To brek the schyp, sa we the land atteyn.                           10
    Fra Tarchon had thir wordis said, but mair

  And thar kelys stak in the slyke fast by,
  But ony harm or danger, euery one.
  Bot sa tyd not onto thy schyp, Tarchon:
  For in the schald scho stoppys, and dyd stand
  Apon a dry chyngill or bed of sand,                                 20

  Quhill fynaly, thar rokkand as scho stude,
  To brystis scho, and ryvys all in sondyr,
  Warpyt the men amyd the faym thar vndir;

  That on the streym went flotand heir and thar,
  Maid to thar landing gret impediment,
  And slyddry glar so from wallys went

    Than na delay of sleuth, nor feir, ne bost,
  Withheld Turnus, bot with hys haill armee

  He dyd array all sammyn in that stound.                              5
  The trumpettis blew thar bludy weirlyke sownd:
  And fyrst, in syng of gud luk in the weris,

  And throw the schynand hawbrek euery deill;

  For in the cost he tholys dynt of ded.
  Syne smate he Lychas, and hym hes al to torn,

  And onto Phebus God was consecrait,
  And was sa chancy in hys ȝong estait
  That he the swerd eschapit by hys hap;
  Bot not at this tyme so the dedis clap.
  And not far thens this douchty Eneas                                25
  Kyllyt the dowr and stalwart Cysseas,
  And put to deth the bustuus Gyas strang,

  With haltand wordis and with mekill woust,
  Eneas threw a dart at hym that tyde,

  As thou the ȝyng Clytius dyd persew,

  And wrachitly had lyin ded, I weyn,

  And sum, that wald haue hyt hys corps in hy,

    Than to the traist Achates said Ene:                              25
  Reik me dartis and castyng speris, quod he,

  With this come Clawsus, full of vassalage,

  _Quhou Pallas confortis his ost of Archadye,

  In sic a place had takyn land attanys,                               5

  For scharpnes of that sted, bot leif thar hors;

  The Latynys followand thame in all thar mycht:
  Than, quhile with prayer, now with wordis sowr,                     15
  Thar curage he enflambis to the stowr,
  Quhilk maner havyng is suyth, as is the creid,
  As vtir poynt remedy at sik a neid.

  I ȝou beseik, be ȝour gret renowne,                                 20
  And be ȝour forcy dedis done of ald,

  And be the oftis and mony victorys
  That ȝe in weir and batale wan feill sys,
  And be my gude beleif and hoyp, that now
  With haill confidens restis fixt in ȝow,
  As to atteyn onto my faderis glore,                                  5

  Do nevir, for schame, onto ȝour self that lak,

  Nor Goddis mycht gaynstandyng ws, quod he:

  And als feill handis to debait the melle.                           20

  On land is left ws heir na place to fle:
  Quhat! wald ȝe ryn to Troy owt throw the see?
    Thus said he, and forthwith, or he wald ces,                      25
  Amyd hys fays ruschit in the pres,
  Quhar as the rowtis thikast war in stowr.
  And first of other, to hys fatale howr,

  Quham fyrst ourrollyt with a mekill stane,                          30
  Throw gyrd hys cost syne with a castyng dart,
  Persyng hys rybbys throuch, at the ilk part
  Quhar beyn the cupplyng of the ryg bone,
  And the ilk schaft stak in hys cors onone.
  Pallas it joggillit, and furth drew in hy:                           5
  Quham ane Hysbon, standand neir tharby,
  Wenyt to have kawcht, bot the gryp he falyt;
  For as onwar he stowpyt, and devalyt,
  Wod wroth for wo of this myschews ded
  Of hys deir fallow, in the ilk sted                                 10
  Pallas hym keppyt syk wys on hys brand
  That all the blaid, vp to the hylt and hand,
  Amyd hys flaffand longis hyd has he,
  On sik maner that na man mycht it se.
  Syne Pallas set apon Anchemolus,                                    15
  And Sthenelus, that of the kyng Rhetus
  Prynce of Marrubyanys, ancyent pepill, beyn;
  The quhilk Anchemolus was that ilk, I weyn,
  Defowlyt hys faderis bed incestuusly,
  And had forlayn hys awyn stepmoder by.                              20
  And ȝe alsso, stowt gemel brether twa,

  Nane mycht decern betwix ȝou quhar ȝe stude;
  Quhilk maner errour, or sik mysknawyng,
  To fader and mother is oft plesand thyng,
  Seand thar childer resembill ane lyknes:
  Bot at this tyme has Pallas, as I ges,                              30
  Markyt ȝou swa with sic rude differens,
  That by hys keill ȝe may be knaw fra thens.
  For swa stud with the, Tymber, thou art ded,
  Evandrus swerd hes swepyt of thy hed;
  And thy rycht arm of smyttyn, O Laryd,                               5
  Amyd the feild lyis the besyde,
  And half lyfles thi fyngyrris war sterand,
  Within thy neif doys gryp and faik the brand.
    Than schame and dolour, mydlit baith ourane,
  Baldis the pepill Arcad eueryane                                    10
  To the bargane aganyst thar ennemys,
  For Pallas wordis maid thar curage rys,
  And eik, for thai beheld befor thar eyn
  Hys douchty dedis, thai hym love and meyn.
  For Pallas than throw gyrd Rheteus the kyng,                        15
  As he on cace glaid by on char fleyng:
  Na mair space was of tary ne delay
  That Ilus deth prolongit the ilk day;
  For as agane the, Ilo, with fell feir

  As he on cace was fleand fers as flynt

  And thy brother Tyres, that by the was:
  Ourweltis Retheus in ded thrawys atanys,                            25
  And with hys helys smayt the Rutilian planys,
  Tumlyt from hys hie cart chargit quhar he sat,
  And on the grund rebundis with a squat.
  And lyke as sum tyme in the symmyris drowth,
  Quhen wyndis rysys of the north or sowth,                           30
  In seir placis the hyrd, at hys desire,
  Amang the scroggy rammell settis the fyre;

  Spredand on breid, vpblesys euery sted;
  Than he that set the kyndillyng glaid and gay                        5
  Behaldis quhou that the low doys mak deray,

  And maid debait to help Pallas in fyght.                            10

  And gan hym self weil schrowd vnder his scheild;

  And Thoas syne sa smayt apon the hed

  Forto eschew hys sonnys fatys strang,
  Hyd hym prevely the thik woddis amang:
  Bot, fra the auld Alesus lay to de,                                 25
  And ȝeldis vp the breth with wawland E,
  The fatale systeris set to hand onon,
  And can this ȝong Alesus so dispon,
  That by Evandrus wapynnys, the ilk stownd,
  He destinat was to caucht the dedis wond.                           30
  Towart quham Pallas bownyt has ful sone,
  And in hys renk on this wys maid hys boyn:

  For quhil Alesus onavisytly

  That was to hym hys frend and fallow deir,
  Hys breist stud nakyt, but armour or geir,
  Quharin he Pallas dedly schaft ressauyt.                            15
    Bot Lawsus, wilfull hys syde to haue savyt,
  As he that was a gret part of the ost,
  And lyst not suffir, with sik feir na bost,
  Or slauchtir maid be Pallas and deray,

  Down bettyn war the barnage of Archadys;
  Down bettyn eik war the Hethruryanys;
  And ȝhe also, feil bodeis of Troianys,
  That war not put by Grekis to vtyrrans.
  Than all the ostis semlyt with speir and lans,                      30

  Full douchtely Pallas on the ta part
  Inforcis hym to greif hys fays that tyde;
  Lawsus resistis on that othir syde.
  Thar agis was not far indifferent,
  And of maist semly statur, quhar thai went,                         10

CAP. VIII.

  _Quhou that fers Turnus has ȝong Pallas slane,
  For quham hys folkis makis gret dolour and mayn._


  Duryng this fervour of the bargane swa,
  The haly nymphe, clepit Juturna,
  Hir brother Turnus dyd monys and exhort
  To succur Lawsus, and hys folk support;
  The quhilk Turnus, as in hys spedy char
  The myd rowtis went sloppand heir and thar,
  Beheld hys ferys debatand with Pallas:                               5
  Lo, now is tyme to desist, and lat pas
  All sic bargane, quod he; cessis in hy;
  For I will set on Pallas anerly;
  Only to me, and to nane other wight,
  The victory pertenys of sik a knycht;                               10
  Glaidly I wald hys fader stude heirby,
  This interprys to dereyn and aspy.
  Thus said he, and hys feris at command
  Voydit the feild, and all plane left the land.
    Than ȝong Pallas, seand Rutylianys                                15
  Withdraw the feild sa swith, and rovm the planys,
  At the prowd byddyng of thar prynce and kyng,
  Amervellit full gretly of this thing,
  And farly can on Turnus to behald,
  Our all hys bustuus body, as he wald,                               20
  Rollyng hys eyn, and all hys corps in hy
  With thrawyn luke on far begouth aspy;
  Syne movyng fordwart, with sic wordis on hie,
  To answer Turnus speche, thus carpys he:
  Owthir now, quod he, for ay be lovyt I sall                         25
  Of rych kyngly spulȝe triumphall,
  Quhilk heir I sall rent from myne aduersar,
  Or than salbe renownyt evirmar
  Of ane excellent end moist gloryus.
  Do wa thy bost and mannance maid to ws:                             30
  For my fader, quhom thou desyris besyde,
  Reputtis all elyke, quhou evir the chance betyde.
  And sayand thus, amyd the plane furth startis:
  The blude congelyt abowt Archadyane hartis.
    Turnus down lepys from hys twa quhelit char,                       5
  And bownys fast towartis his aduersar.
  Lyke as ane lyoun from the hillys hycht,
  Amyd the valle had scharply gottin a sycht
  Of sum prowd bull, with hys horn in the plane
  Addressand hym reddy to mak bargane,                                10
  Cummys bradand on the best fast in a lyng;
  On siclyke wys was Turnus tocummyng:
  And quhen that Pallas saw hym cum sa neir
  He mycht areke to hym a casting speir,
  Formast he bownys to the jonyng place,                              15
  Gyf sa betyd that fortoun, of hir grace,
  Hys interprys for stowt ondertakyng
  Wald help, or hym support in ony thing,
  As he that ȝong was, and of strenth all owt
  Na wys compeir to Turnus stern and stowt;                           20
  And to the gret Goddis in hevyn abone
  Apon this maner prayand said he sone:
    I the beseik, thou myghty Hercules,
  Be my faderis gestnyng, and the ilk des
  Quhar thou strangear was ressauyt to herbry,                        25
  Assist to me, cum in my help in hy,
  To perform this excellent fyrst journe;
  That Turnus in the ded thraw may me se
  Bereif fra hym hys bludy armour red,
  And, ȝaldand vp the breth in the ilk sted,                          30
  Mot with hys eyn behald me hym befor
  In hie tryumphe, with ourhand as victor.
    Gret Hercules the ȝong man hard onon,
  And from the boddum of hys hart can gron,
  Hydand hys smert for rewth of Pallas ȝyng,                           5
  Seand the fatys wald haue hys endyng;
  And for ennoy salt terys, all in vayn,
  Furth ȝettyng our hys chekis thyk as rayn.
  Tho Jupiter, hys curage to astabill,
  Thus to hys son spak wordys amyabill.                               10
    Tyll euery mortale wofull wight, perfay,
  Determyt standis the fixit lattir day;
  Ane schort and onrecoverabill term is set
  Of lyfe, quhen all most neydlyngis pay that det:
  Bot, to prolong thar fame by nobill dedis,                          15
  Fra vertuus wark that cumys and procedis.
  Quhou mony sonnys and deir childryn, said he,
  Of goddis kyn, vnder Troy wallys hie
  War done to ded, and brytnyt blude and bone!
  So that amangis all otheris Sarpedon,                               20
  My tendir get, my kyn, and blude, lyis slane.
  Forsuyth also, I say the into plane,
  The fynale fayt awatis Turnus in feild,
  The dait and methis approchis of hys eild.
    On this wys spak gret Jove to Hercules;                           25
  And, with that word, hys eyn towart the pres
  On the Rutilian feild addressis he.
  And, the ilk stownd, ȝong Pallas lattis fle
  With mekill fors at Turnus a gret speir,
  And syne onon hys brycht brand burnyst cleir                        30
  Hyntis furth of the scheith to mak debait.
  The schaft flaw towart Turnus, and hym smait
  Apon the schulder, abuf the gardis hie

  And throw the bordour of the scheild swa persyt,                     5
  Quhill fynaly in sum deill it traversyt,
  And hurt a part of Turnus byg body.
    Than Turnus smyttyn, full of felony,
  A bustuus lance with grundyn hed ful kene,
  That lang quhile taysyt he in proper teyn,                          10
  Leyt gyrd at Pallas, and thus wys said he:
  Consider ȝoungkeir, gyf our lancis be,
  Bettir of tempyr and mair penytratyve.
  And, with the word, the schaft flaw furth belyve,
  So that the scharp poynt of the brangland speir                     15
  Throw owt amyddis of the scheild can scheir,
  Persand sa mony platis of irne and steill,
  And sa feill plyis of bull hydis ilk deill,
  All sammyn cowchit in hys target strang,
  The bustuus strake throw all hys armour thrang.                     20
  That styntit na thing at the fyne hawbryk,
  Quhil throu the cost thyrlyt the dedly pryk.
  Pallas, nocht schrynkand for the mortale dynt,
  Invane the hait schaft of hys wond lies hynt;
  For al togidder by the sammyn way                                   25
  The blude and sawle passys hyne bath tway.
  Apon hys wond onon he ruschis down:
  Abuf hym rang hys harnes with a sovn:
  And that onfrendly erth inimycall,
  That in hys deth he suld not scryk nor call,                        30
  As was the gys, with bludy mowth bait he.
  Turnus, abufe hym standand, carpys on hie:
    O ȝhe pepill of Arcaid, takis tent,
  And my wordis do rehers and present
  To kyng Evander, sayand hym playnly,                                 5
  That hys son Pallas to hym send haue I
  In sik array as that he hes deservyt;
  And, of my gentrys, wil he be preservit
  To all estait and honour funerall,
  With all solace pertenyng beryall                                   10
  Of tumbe and of entyrment, as efferis.
  Na lytill thyng, perfay, into thir weris

  And, sayand thus, with hys left fut hes he
  Pallas ded corps ourwelt, or euer he stent,                         15
  And syne abowt hys sydis sone has rent

  Quharin was gravin craftely and weill
  Of Danavs douchteris the iniquyte,
  Quhou that the fyfty ȝong men, schame to se,                        20

  As thai war spowsyt to thar ladeis brycht;

  In weighty platis of the gold massy;
  Of quhais spulȝe now is Turnus glaid,
  Joyfull and blyth that he it conquest had.
    O mannis mynd, so ignorant at all
  Of thingis tocum and chancis quhilkis may fall!                     30
  Vpheit sone in blynd prosperyte,

  _The rich Magus na ranson mycht reskew,
  And preist Hemonydes, baith Eneas slew._


  Tho nane incertane rumour nor demyng,
  Bot sovyr boydword cam thar, and warnyng,                           20
  Ontill Eneas of this gret myschance,
  Schawand quhou that his folkis stud in ballance.
  As bot in litill distans all from ded;
  The tyme requiryt forto set remeid,
  And succur Troianys quhilkis had tane the flycht.
  Than, as wod lyon, ruschit he in the fight,
  And all quham he arekis nerrest hand                                 5
  Without reskew dovn mawis with his brand;
  The bytand blaid abowt hym inveroum
  Amyd the rowtis reddis large rovm.
  Enragit and inflambit thus in ire
  Throw owt the ostis Turnus, that prowd syre,                        10
  Quhilk had this new slauchtir maid, socht he:
  Ay prentand in hys mynd befor hys E
  The gudly Pallas, was sa stowt and ȝyng,
  And the gret gentryce of Evander kyng;
  The cheir and fest hym maid bot a stranger;                         15
  Per ordour all thing, quhou and quhat maner
  He was ressauyt, and tretit thankfully;
  Syne of hys band of frendschip and ally
  With athis sworn and interchangit handis,
  Remembryng tho his promys and cunnandis.                            20
  Amovit in this heit, or euer he stynt,
  Four ȝong men quyk he hes in handis hynt,
  That born was of the cite hecht Sulmon;
  Alsmony syne he takyn has onon
  Bred and vpbrocht besyde the flude Vfens,                           25
  Quham that he etlys forto send from thens
  To Pallas lykewalkis and obsequeis,
  To strow his funeral fyre of byrnand treis,
  As was the gys, with blude of presoneris,
  Eftir the ald rytis into mortale weris.                             30
    Syne hynt Eneas a perellus lance in hand,
  And it addressis far furth on the land
  To ane Magus, that subtell was and sle,
  And jowkit in vnder the speir has he;
  The schaft schakand flaw furth abufe hys hede;                       5
  And he Eneas in that samyn sted
  Abowt the kneis grippyt humylly,
  With petuus voce syne thus begouth to cry:
  Be thy deir faderys gost I the beseik,
  And be that gude beleif quhilk thou has eik                         10
  Of Ascanyvs vprysyng to estait,
  Thys silly sawle of myne, sa faynt and mayt,
  Thow salf to my a son and fader deir.
  I haue a hows, rych, full of mobillis seir,
  Quharin bedelvyn lyis a gret talent,                                15
  Or charge of fyne siluer, in veschell quent

  Ane huge weght of fynast gold tharby,
  Oncunȝeit ȝit, ne nevir put in wark:
  Sa thou me salf, thy pyssans is so stark,                           20
  The Troianys glory nor thar victory
  Sal na thyng change nor dymynew tharby,
  Nor a puyr sawle, thus hyngand in ballance,
  May sik diuisioun mak nor discrepans.
    Thus said this silly Magus, all invane.                           25
  Quhamtill Eneas answeris thus agane:
  Sa mony talentis of fyne siluyr and gold,
  Quhilkis thou rehersand heir befor hes told,
  Do kepe onto thy small childyr and ayris;
  Lat thame bruke weill, I consent it be tharis.                      30
  All interchange and ransonyng, perfay,
  In this batale Turnus hes done away,
  Now laitly slayand ȝong Pallas, allace!
  That rewthfull harm, and that myschews cace,
  Felys baith Ascanyus and my faderis gost,                            5
  For thai na litill thyng tharby hes lost.
  Thus sayand, by the helm hym grippys he
  With hys left hand, and fast as he mycht dre
  Writh down hys nek, quharin, but mair abaid,
  Hys bludy brand vp to the hyltis slaid.                             10
    Not far thens stude Hemonydes allane,
  Prest onto Phebus and the thrynfald Dyane,
  On quhais hed wympillit holy garlandis
  With thar pendentis lyke to a mytyr standis,
  Hys habyt as the scheyn son lemand lycht,                           15
  And all hys armour quhite and burnyst brycht:
  Quham Eneas assalyt myghtyly,
  And gan do chays owt throw the feld in hy,
  That fleand stummyrryt and to grond went sone:
  The Troiane prynce down lowtis hym abone,                           20
  And with hys brand hym brytnys at devys,
  In maner of ane offerand sacryfys.
  The large schaddow of Eneas in feild
  Dyd haill the ded corps of this preist ourheld.
  Serestus sortis vp hys armour gay,                                  25
  And on hys schuldris careit hes away,
  To hyng as trophe or syng victoriall
  Tyll Mars the God, quhilk Gradyus is call.

  Lo, now he lyggis law, for all hys feris!

  And the body baithit in the hait blude

  With trublit breist and mynd inimicall:

  Thy best belovyt mother sall the not haue

  Na do thy bonys honour with sik cuyr

  And Camerthes, brycht schynand all of gold,

  Fra tyme that anys bedyit hys burnyst brand
  And wet he had in hait Rutiliane blude.
  So that alsso, in this ilk fury wod,                                10

  Of thame sic fervour in thar felloun teyn,

  _Juno rycht quayntly causys Turnus to fle,

  Nane actyve handis, nor stowt myndis, I weyn,
  Nor bodeys reddy all perrellys to sustene,
  Haue thai, thou may se be experiens.
    Quhamto Juno, with humyl reverens,
  Answeryt; my sweit and mast gudly husband,                          15
  Quharto lyst the renew my sorow at hand,

  Thocht ȝit, God wait, accordyt so tobe

  Onto hys fader Dawnus, that our the lave
  Belovyt hym, as raysoun wald, quod sche.
  Now sall he perysch, and now sal he de,
  And sched hys gentyll blude sa pacient,

  With mony oystis, and ryght fair offerand,
  Thy templys and thyne altaris chargit has he,
  In wirschyp of thy myghty maieste.

  In few wordis maid answer thus at all:                              20
  Gif thow askis a resput or delay,

  I leif the to remove hym and withdraw,
  And from this instant perrellus hard fayt
  Steill hym away, and gyde hym by the gait:
  For so lang space ȝyt restis at will of me
  To lenth hys lyfe, quhilk I the grant, quod he.                     30
  Bot gif sa beys, that vndre thy request

  A mysbyleve thou fosteris all invane.

  A feirfull end; he sal to ded be dicht,
  Or than my sawys ar voyd of veryte.

  And to the tentis socht of Lawrentanys.                             30
    Thys Goddes than furth of ane boys clowd

  And fenȝeis eik hys concernans and pacis;
  Syklyke as that, thai say, in diuers placis
  The wraithis walkis of goistis that ar ded,
  Or as the slepy dremys, fra sted to sted

  Quhen mennys myndis oft in dravillyng gronys:
  And all befor the forfront of the feild
  Richt haltandly, as curageus vnder scheild,
  Musturis this ymage, that with dartis keyn
  Aggrevyt Turnus, and dyd hym chyde in teyn,                         20
  Prouocand hym to bargane and tyl ire.
  And Turnus tho als hoyt as any fyre

  Then Turnus, wenand Ene had tane the flycht,
  And al awondryt of that selcouth fyght,

  Thydder went this wrath or schaddo of Ene,

  And hyd hyr dern vndre hychis tharin.
  Na slawar Turnus hastis hym to ryn,                                 20
  That but delay he spedis to this schyp,

  And scars was entrit in the forcastell,

  Than soyn the cabyll in sondir smytis sche,                         25
  And fra the schor draif the schip throu the see.

  And in hys renk quham euer he met lay ded;
  Full mony a man he kyllit in that sted.                             30

  And of hys lyfe salvyng na thyng he rocht;                          10
  With handis junct vphevit towart hevin,

  _In Turnus sted Mezentius dyd succeid,
  Killyt doun his fays, and spulȝeit of thar weid._


  Durand this quhile, in fatis marciall,
  Mezentyus movyt with ardour bellycall,
  Be instigatioun of Jove in that neid,
  Can to the batale in hys place succeid;
  And the Troianys to invaid na thing sparis,                          5
  That semyt prowd as all the feild war tharis.
  Than sammyn to recontyr hym atanys

  And all assailȝeit Mezentius allone;
  Aganyst a man thai rowtys euery one,                                10
  Inflambyt all in malyce, maid persutys,
  And thik as haill schour at hym schaftis schutis.
  Bot he, lyke to a ferm rowk, quhilk we se
  Strekyt on lenth amyd the large see,
  Sytuat aganys the rageand wyndis blast,                             15
  And brym wallys boldynnand wondyr fast,
  From all that violens doys hym self defend,
  And haill the fors sustenys to the end
  Baith of the hevynnys and byr of seys rage,
  Remanand onremovyt ferm in hys stage:                               20
  Als stern standis Meȝentius in that stound
  And first he hes fellit and laid to the grond
  Hebrus, the son of ane Dolycaon,
  And hym besyde Latagus flew onon,
  And Palmus eik, accustumat to fle:
  Bot with a stane Latagus brytnyt he
  Quhilk of a montane semyt a gret nuke,
  With quham hym on the vissage he ourtuke;
  And Palmus howgh sennonys smait in tway                              5
  Maid hym sa slaw he mycht nocht fle away;
  Thar armour syne to Lawsus gevyn hes he
  To weir on hys schuldris, and crovn on hie
  Thar creistis set, the quhilk sa rychly schane.
  He slew also Evantes a Troiane,                                     10
  And Mynas syne he kyllys in the feild,

  With a fyre broynd, and the self samyn nycht

  Withhaldis now the body of Mynas:
  So brym in stowr that stond Mezentyus was.
  Lyke to the strenthy sangler, or the bore,
  Quham hundis quest with mony quhryne and rore

  With spaldis hard and harsk awfull and teyn,
  That nane of all the huntmen thar present
  Hym to engreif has strenth or hardyment,
  Nor dar approchyng within hys byt neir,
  Bot standand far on dreich with dart and speir,                     10
  Assoverit of hys reik, the beste assays,
  With felloun schowtis, bustuus cryis, and brays.
  Nane other wys stud all the Tuscane rowt

  And, thocht thai just caws had of wreth and feyd,                   15
  Thar was nane of thame durst hym put to ded,
  Nor curage had with drawyn swerd in hand
  Hym till assaill, nor mach apon the land;
  Bot with takillis and castyn dartis on far
  Thai warp at hym, bot durst not ane cum nar,                        20
  And with huge clamour hym infestis that tyde:
  He, onabasyt, abowt on euery syde
  Behaldis, gyrnand full of proper teyn,
  And with hys scheild choppyt by schaftis bedene.
    Furth of the ancyent boundis of Coryt tho                         25
  Was cum a Greik, quhilk clepyt was Acro,

  Had left hys spowsal trewth plicht oncompleit:
  Quham as Mezentius saw amyd the rowt
  Hym grevand soir, as weriour stern and stowt,                       30
  And saw the plesand plomys set on hycht
  Of hys tymrell, and eik the purpour brycht,
  Quhilk of his trewthplycht lufe he bair in syng;
  Than, lyke a hungry lyon rumysyng,
  Constrenyt by hys rageand empty maw,                                 5
  The beistis dennys circuland all on raw,
  Gif he on cace aspys a swyft ra,
  Or the ȝyng hart with spryngand tyndis twa,
  Joyful he bradis tharon dispytuusly,
  With gapand gowle, and vprasys in hy                                10
  The lokkyrris lyand in his nek rowght,
  And all the bestis bowellis thrymlys throwght,
  Hurkylland tharon, quhar he remanyt and stude,
  Hys gredy gammys bedyis with the red blude:
  On the sammyn wys, Mezentius rycht baldly                           15
  Mydwart hys fays rowt ruschit in hy;
  Down smytis fey Acron amyd the ost,
  That in the ded thraw, ȝaldand vp the gost,
  Smate with hys helys the grond in maltalent,
  And brokkyn schaftis with hys blude bysprent.                       20
    This ilk Mezentius eik dedenȝeit nocht
  To sla Orodes, quhilk than was onflocht,
  That is to knaw, quhill frawart hym he went,
  And reput na wys, as by hys entent,

  Onawarnyst, quhen he na defens mycht mak,
  Bot ran abowt and met hym in hys rays;
  Than athir man assemblit face for face:
  Orodes mair of prattik was all owt,
  Bot the tother in dedis of armys mair stowt,                        30
  That to the erth ourthrawyn he hes his feir,
  And, possand at hym with hys stalwart speir,
  Apon hym set hys fut, and thus he said:
  O now my feris, beys blyth and glaid;
  Lo, a gret party of this weir, but les,                              5
  Heir lyis at erd, the douchty Orodes.
  Hys feris sammyn rasyt vp a cry,
  With joyus sound in syng of victory,
  And blew the prys triumphall for his deth:
  Bot this Orodes, ȝaldand vp the breth,                              10
  Onto Mezentyus carpys thus on hie:

  For weill I wait that sone I salbe wrokyn,
  Na, for all thy prowd wordis thou has spokkyn,
  Thou sall nocht lang endur into sik joy;                            15

  Or previdyt has myghty Jove, quod he,

  And sayand thus, the schaft the ilk thraw

  Furth hynt hys swerd at hang law by hys thee,                       10
  And fervently towart hys fa can pas,

  That salt teris fast our hys chekis ran.
  Forsuyth, I sall not ourslyp in this sted

  I sall rehers, gyf ony faith may be

  Hys ennemys lance fixit in hys scheild.
  Betwix thame ruschys in the ȝong Lawsus,

  That reddy was to smyte a dedly wond,
  In steppis he, and baldly the ilk stound

  And can resist and stynt the gret Enee.

  Quhill that Mezentius of the feild wan owt,

  With schaftis schot, and flanys gret plente,

  That all enragyt hys sovir targe erekkit,
  And thar vndre hym haldis closly dekkyt.
  And lyke as sum tyme clowdis brystis attanys,

  Or in sum craggis clyft, or deip cavern,                            20
  So lang as that the schour lestis on the plane,
  That he may, when the son schynys agane,

  Quhil he the pres of batale styntis that tyde,
  And all thar fors sustenyt and deray;
  Reprevand Lawsus, thus begouth to say,
  And mannansyt hym with brand of blude all red:

  Or quhou dar thou ondertak into fyght

  For so Eneas stokis hys styf brand

  That swerd, befor maid mannansyng and bost,
  Throw gyrd that gentill body and hys cost,

  And eik hys cote of goldyn thredis brycht

  And left the body ded, and hyne dyd pas.

  And drew abak hys hand, and rewth has hynt;
  For so into hys mynd, eftir the dynt,

  And he hym self betwix hys armys tway                               20
  The ded body vpliftis fra the grond,
  That with the red blude of his new grene wond
  Besparklyt had hys ȝallow lokkis brycht,
  That ayr war kemmyt and addressyt rycht.




CAP. XIV.

  _Fra Mezentius knew ȝong Lawsus deces,
  Hym to revenge his lyfe lost in the pres._


  The meyn sesson, hys fader with his feris,
  Down at the fludis syde of Tyberis,
  Stanschit his wondis with watyr by and by,
  Weschand the blude and swait from hys body.
  Hys helm of steil besyde hym hang weil ne                            5
  Apon a grayn or branch of a grene tre;
  Hys other weghty harnes, gud in neid,
  Lay on the gyrs besyde hym in the meid;
  Hys trasty chosyn verlettis hym abowt:
  And he ful for wondyt, all in dowt,                                 10
  Stude lenand with hys wery nek and bonys
  Owt our a bowand tre, with sair gronys;
  Hys weil kemmyt berd, hyngand ful straucht
  Apon his breist, onto hys gyrdill raucht:
  And feill tymys on Lawsus menys he,                                 15
  Prayand full oft he mycht hym falsly se,
  And mony messyngeris onto hym hes send,
  To withdraw hym the feild, and to defend
  That he abyde na langar in bargane,
  And schaw quhat sorow for hym hys fader had tane.                   20
    Bot than Lawsus ded owt of the feild
  Hys wofull feris careit apon a scheild,
  Wepand sa gret a man was brocht to grond,
  And discumfyt with sa grysly a wond.
  Mezentius mynd and consait, the ilk tyde,
  Suspekand the harmys quhilkis war betyde,
  On far considerit the caus of thar murnyng,
  And on hys canos hair the dust can slyng,
  With mekill powdir fyland hys hasart hed;                            5
  And baith hys handis in that sammyn sted
  Towart the hevin vphevis in a fary,
  And he the Goddis and starnys fast dyd wary;
  Syne, lenand on hys sonnys corps, thus cryis:
    O my deir child and tendir get heir lyis!                         10
  Had I sa gret appetit and delyte
  Onto this wrachit lyfe, sa ful of syte,
  That I the sufferit to entyr in my sted
  Vndre our fays hand, and with thy ded
  My lyfe is salfit? Ha, I thy fader heir,                            15
  Quhilk the begat, my only son sa deir,
  Suld I be salf and lyfand eftir the,
  Throu tha sa grisly wondis that I se?
  Allace, onto me, wrachit catyve thing,
  Myne exill now at last and banysyng                                 20
  Becummyn is hard and insufferabill!
  The stound of deth, the panys lamentabill,
  Is deip engravyn in my hart onsound;
  Now am I smyttyn with the mortal wond!
  I, the self man was the caus of thy ded,                            25
  With my trespas, my child, in euery sted
  Filyt the glor and honour of thy name,
  Thy hie renovn bespottand with my schame,
  As I that was, by invy and haitrent
  Of my awin pepill, with thar haill assent,                          30
  Expellit from my ceptre and my ryng,
  And was adettyt, for my mysdoyng
  Onto our cuntre, till haue sufferit pane:
  I aucht and worthy was to haue bene slane,
  And to haue ȝald this wikkyt sawle of myne                           5
  Be all maner of turment and of pyne,
  Fortill amend myne offencis and fed.
  Ha, now I lyf, allace! and thou art ded!
  Ȝit want I not off men the cumpany,
  Nowder lyght of lyfe, ne cleirnes of the sky,                       10
  Bot soyn I sal thame leif and part tharfra.
    And sayand thus, sammyn with mynd ful thra
  He rasyt hym vp apon hys wondit thee,
  And determyt to revenge hym or de:
  For thocht the violens of hys sair smart                            15
  Maid hym onfery, ȝit hys stalwart hart
  And curage ondekeit was gude in neid.
  He bad ga fech Rhebus, hys ryall sted,
  Quhilk was hys wirschip and hys comfort haill,
  And hys support hys fays to assaill;                                20
  For by thys hors in euery gret iourne
  Hame fra the feild victour eschapit he.
  Quhamto Mezentyus, but mair abaid,
  Seand the steid drowpand and sad, thus said:
  Rhebus, we twa hes levit lang yfeir,                                25
  Gyf that to mortal wightis in this erd heir
  Ony tyme may be reput lang, quod he.
  Owder this day beys thou revengear with me
  Of Lawsus dolorus deith, and wrek our schame,
  And sall as victour with the bryngyn hame                           30
  Ȝon bludy spulȝe, and Eneas hed;
  Or, gif na fors nor strenth into that sted
  Will suffir ony way that it be so,
  We sal in feild sammyn de baith two.
  For, O moist forcy steid, my lovyt foill,                            5
  I can na wys beleif at thou may thoill
  To be at ony otheris commandment,
  Nor that the lift dedeyn, gif I war schent,
  Till obey ony master or lord Troiane.
    And sayand thus, ful towartly onane                               10
  The steid bekend held to hys schulder plat,
  And he at eys apon hys bak doun sat;
  And bath hys handis fillyt with dartis keyn,
  With helm on hed burnyst brycht and scheyn,
  Abuf the quhilk hys tymbret buklyt was,                             15
  Lyke till a lokryt mayn with mony fas.
  And into sik array with swyft curs he
  Furth steris hys steid, and draif in the melle.
  Deip in hys hart boldynnys the felloun schame,
  Myxit with dolour, angir, and defame;                               20
  The fervent luf of hys son ȝyng of age
  Gan catchyng hym into the furyus rage;
  Tharto alsso persuadis to the fyght
  Hys hors weil knawin hys hardyment and mycht:
  And, in sik poynt, throw owt the rowtis all                         25
  With mychty voce thrys dyd Eneas call.
    Eneas hard hym cry, and weil hym knew,
  And glaid tharof can towartis hym persew,
  And prayand says; the fader of Goddis hie,
  And eik mychty Apollo, that grant to me,                            30
  Thou wald begyn in bargan on this land
  To mell with me, and to meyt hand for hand.
  Thus carpyt he, and with stern lance, but tary,
  Furth steppys forto meyt hys aduersary.
    Bot Mezentius, seand hym cumand,                                   5
  Cryit to hym onon and bad hym stand:
  O thou maist cruell aduersar, said he,
  Quhat wenys thou so to effray and bost me,
  Sen thou my son has me bereft this day,
  Quhilk was only the maner and the way                               10
  Quharby thou mycht ourcum me and distroy?
  Now, sen that I haue tynt all warldis joy,
  Nowder I abhor the ded, to starve in fyght,
  Nor rak I ocht of ony Goddis mycht.
  Desist, and ces to bost me or manas,                                15
  For I am cum to de in this ilk plas;
  Bot first I bryng the thir rewards, quod he.
  With that word, at his fa a dart leyt fle,
  And eftir that ane other has he cast,
  And syne ane other has he fixit fast,                               20
  About hym prekand in a cumpas large:
  Bot all thir dyntis sustenyt the goldin targe.
  Thrys on the left half fast, as he war wod,
  About Eneas raid he quhar he stude,
  Thik with hys handis swakkand dartis keyn:                          25
  And thrys this Troiane prynce our all the greyn,
  Intil hys stalwart stelyt scheild stikand owt,
  Lyke a hair wod the dartis bair abowt.
  At last, as he ennoyt of this deray,
  This irksum traysyng, jowkyng, and delay,                           30
  And cumryt wolx sa mony dartis invane
  Thus oft to draw furth and to cast agane,
  As he that was matchit that tyme, but faill,
  With hys fa man in bargane inequale,
  Quhilk ay was at avantage and onflocht,                              5
  Full mony thing revoluyt he in thocht;
  Syne on that weirman ruschit he in teyn:
  In the forhed, betwix the horsys eyn,
  He kest hys speir with all his fors and mycht.
  Vpstendis thar the stalwart steid on hycht,                         10
  And with his helys flang up in the ayr;
  Down swakkis the knycht sone with a fellon fair,
  Foundris fordwart flatlyngis on hys spald,
  Ourquhelmyt the man, and can hys feit onfald.
    Than the Latynys, and eik pepill Troianys,                        15
  The hevynnys dyndlit with a schowt at anys.
  Eneas gyrd abufe hym with a braid,
  Hynt furth hys swerd, and forthir thus he said:
  Quhar is he now, Mezentius, sa stern?
  Quhar is the fers stowt curage of that bern?                        20
    Quhamto Mezentius, this ilk prynce Tyrrheyn,
  Fra that he mycht alyftyn vp his eyn
  To se the hevynnys licht, and draw hys braith,
  And hys rycht mynd agane recoverit haith,
  Thus answeris: O thou dispituus fo,                                 25
  Quharto me chydis thou reprochand so,
  And manancis me to the ded by and by?
  Of my slauchter I think na villany,
  Nor on sik wys heir com I not in feild,
  That I stand aw to swelt vnder my scheild;                          30
  Nor, I beleif, na frendschip in thy handis,
  Nane syk trety of sawchnyng nor cunnandis,
  My son Lawsus band vp with the, perfay.
  Bot of a thyng I the beseik and pray,
  Gif ony plesour may be grantit or beld                               5
  Till aduersaris, that lyis venquyst in feild;
  That is to knaw, suffir my body haue
  Ane sepultur, and with erd be bygrave.
  I knaw abowt me standand in this sted
  My folkis byttyr haitrent and gret feid:                            10
  Defend me from thar furour, I requeir,
  And grant my corps, besyde my sonnys infeir,
  Into sum tumbe entyrit for tobe.
  And sayand thus, knawand at he most de,
  Befor hys eyn persavyt the burnyst brand,                           15
  That throuch hys gorge went from Eneas hand;
  Within hys armour, schortly to conclude,
  Furth bruschit the sawle with gret stremys of blude.
    Be this the son declynyt was almost,
  So that the Latynys and Rutilian ost,                               20
  Quhat for the absens of thar duke Turnus,
  And new slauchter of bald Mezentius,
  Withdrew thame to thar raset in affray,
  And Troianys went onto thar rest quhil day.




THE PROLOUG OF THE ELEVINT BUKE.


  Thow hie renown of Martis chevalry,
  Quhilk gladis euery gentill wight to heir,
  Gif thou mycht Mars and Hercules deify,
  Quharfor beyn nobillys to follow prowes swer?
  Weill auchtin eldris exemplis ws to steir                            5
  Tyll hie curage, all honour till ensew:
  Quhen we consider quhat wirschip tharof grew,
  All vyce detest, and vertu lat ws leyr.

  Prowes, but vyce, is provit lefull thyng
  By haly scriptur into syndry place,                                 10
  Be Machabeus, Josue, Dauid kyng,
  Mychael, and eyk hys angellys full of grace,
  That can the dragon furth of hevynnys chace
  With vailȝeand dyntis of ferm myndis contrar:
  Nane other strokis nor wapynnys had thai thar,                      15
  Nother speir, buge, pol ax, swerd, knyfe, nor mace.

  In takynnyng that in chevalry or fyght
  Our myndis suld haue just ententioun,
  The grond of batale fundyt apon rycht;
  Not for thou lyst to mak discentioun,                               20
  To seik occasyons of contentioun,
  Bot rype thy querrell, and discus it plane:
  Wrangis to reddres suld wer be vndertane,
  For na conquest, reif, skat, nor pensioun.

  To speke of moral vertuus hardyment,                                 5
  Or rather of dyvyne, is myne entent;
  For warldly strenth is febill and impotent
  In Goddis sight, and insufficient.
  The Psalmyst says, that God is not content
  In mannys stalwart lymmys nor strenth of cors,                      10
  Bot into thame that trastis in hys fors,
  Askand mercy, and dredand jugement.

  Strang fortitud, quhilk hardyment cleip we,
  Abuf the quhilk the vertu souerane
  Accordyng pryncis, hecht magnanymyte,                               15
  Is a bonte set betwix vicis twane:
  Of quham fuyl hardynes clepit is the tane,
  That vndertakis all perrellis but avice;
  The tother is namyt schamefull cowardyce,
  Voyd of curage, and dolf as ony stane.                              20

  The first is hardy all owt by mesur,
  Of tyme nor rayson gevis he na cuyr,
  No dowt he castis, bot all thinkis suyr,
  Nocht may he suffir, nor hys hait endur:
  The tother is of all prowes sa puyr,                                25
  That evir he standis in feir and felloun dreid,
  And nevir dar vndertak a douchty deid,
  Bot doith all curage and all manheid smuyr.

  The first soundis towart vertu sum deill,
  Hardy he is, couth he be avyse;
  Of hardyment the tother has na feill:                                5
  Quhou may curage and cowardys agre?
  Of fortitud to compt ȝou euery gre,
  As Arestotill in hys Ethikis doith expres,
  It wald, as now, conteyn our lang proces;
  Quharfor of other chevalry carp will we.                            10

  Gyf Crystis faithfull knychtis lyst ws be,
  So as we aucht, and promyst hes at font,
  Than mon we byde baldly, and neuer fle,
  Nowder be abasyt, tepyt, nor ȝit blunt,

  Pawle witnessith, that nane sall wyn the crown,
  Bot he quhilk dewly makis hym reddy bown
  To stand wightly, and feght in the forfront.

  And quha that sall nocht wyn the crown of meid,
  That is to say, the euerlestand blys,                               20
  The fyre eternall neidlyngis most thai dreid:
  For Cryst into his gospell says, I wys,
  Quha bydis nocht with me contrar me is:
  And gif thou be aganyst God, but weir
  Than art thou wageour onto Lucifer.                                 25
  God salf ws all from sik a fyre as this!

  The armour of our chevalry, perfay,
  So the Apostyll techis ws expres,
  Not corporall bot sperituall beyn thai,
  Our conquyst haill, our vassellage and prowes,
  Aganyft spretis and pryncis of myrknes;                              5
  Not agane man, owr awyn brother and mait,
  Nor ȝit aganyst our maker to debait,
  As rabell tyll all vertu and gudnes.

  The flesch debatis aganys the spiritual gost,
  Hys hie curage with sensual lust to law,                            10
  And, be the body victor, baith ar lost;
  The spreit wald vp, the cors ay down list draw:
  Thy secund fa the warld, ane other thraw,
  Makis strang assaltis of covatys and estait,
  Aganyst quham is full perrellus debait;                             15
  Thir fays famyliar beyn full quaynt to knaw.

  Lyff in thy flesch as master of thy corps,
  Lyf in this warld as nocht ay to remane;
  Resist the fendis slycht with all thy fors,
  He is thy ancyent ennemy, werst of ane;                             20
  A thousand wylys he hes, and mony a trane,
  He kendillis oft thy flesch in byrnand heit,
  He causys wrachit plesans seym full sweit,
  And, for nocht, of this fals warld makis the fane.

  He is thy fa and aduersar principall,                               25
  Of promyssioun wald the expell the land,
  For he the sammyn lost, and caucht a fall;
  Enfors the strangly contrar hym to stand.
  Rays hie the targe of faith vp in thy hand,
  On hed the halsum helm of hoip onlace,
  In cheryte thy body all embrace,                                     5
  And of devoit oryson mak thy brand.

  Stand at defens, and schrynk not for a schore:
  Thynk on the haly marthyris at ar went,
  Thynk on the payn of hell, and endles glore,
  Thynk quhou thy Lord for the on rude was rent,                      10
  Thynk, and thou fle fra hym, than art thou schent,
  Thynk all thou sufferis ontyll hys paynis nocht is,
  Thynk with quhou precyus pryce as thy sawll bocht is,
  And ay the moder of grace in mynd enprent.

  Feill beyn thy fays, fers, and full of slycht,                      15
  Bot be thou stalwart campioun and knycht;
  In feild of grace with forsaid armour brycht
  Thou may debait thame lyghtly in ilk fyght:
  For of fre will thyne acton is sa wight
  Nane may it pers, wilt thou resist and stand;                       20
  Becum thow cowart, crawdoun recryand,
  And by consent cry cok, thy ded is dycht.

  Thynk quhou that fa is waik and impotent,
  May venquys nane bot thame lyst be ourcum;
  He sal the nevir ourset, but thy consent.                           25
  Eith is defens to say nay, or be dum;
  And for thy weill, lo, thys is all and sum:
  Consent nevir, and thou sall nevir be lost,
  By disassent thou may venquys ane ost,
  And, for anys ȝa, tyne thy meid euery crum.

  Na wondir is; for by exempill we se,                                 5
  Quha servys hys souerane intill all degre
  Full mony days, and eftir syne gif he

  Gyf he wald mercy craif? The sammyn wys

  Bot quhat avalys begyn a strang melle,
  Syne ȝeld the to thy fa, but ony quhy,
  Or cowartly to tak the bak and fle?                                 15
  Na; thar sall nane optene hie victory,
  Les thai sustene the bargane dowchtely;
  And quha so perseueris to the end
  Ane conquerour and campioun euir is kend,
  With palm of triumphe, honour, and glory.                           20

  The maist onsilly kynd of fortoun is
  To haue beyn happy; Boetius techis so;
  As, to haue beyn in welth and hartis blys,
  And now tobe dekeit and in wo:
  Richt so, quha vertuus was, and fallys tharfro. 25
  Of verray rayson malewrus hait is he;
  And ȝit, by grace and hys fre volunte,

  I say, be grace; for quhen thou art in grace,
  Thou may eik grace to grace, ay mor and mor;
  Bot quhen thou fallys be syn tharfra, allace!                        5
  Of thy meryte thou gettis hyr nevirmor:
  Ȝit quhen thou dewly disponys the tharfor,
  Doand all that in the thar may be done,
  Of hys gudnes the etern Lord alssone
  Restorys the meryt, with grace in arlys of glore.                   10

  Haill thy meryt thou had tofor thy fall,
  That is to say, thy warkis meritabill,
  Restorit ar agane baith gret and small,
  And grace tharto, quhilk is sa profitabill
  That thou tharby to eik meryt art habill;                           15
  Bot nocht ilk gre of grace thou had befor;
  That gettis thou not sa soyn, quhill forthyrmor:
  Be war tharfor, fall not, bot standis stabill.

  For lyke as quha offendit had hys lord,
  That lang tofor hys trew servand had bene,                          20
  And syne agane becumis at ane accord
  With hys master, all thocht hys lord wald meyn
  On hys ald seruyce, ȝit netheles, I weyn,

  Tyne nocht ȝour laubour and ȝour thank betweyn.

  Exempill takis of this prynce Ene,
  That, for hys fatale cuntre of behest,

  Quhill he hys realm conquest bath west and est:                      5
  Sen all this dyd he for a temporall ryng,

  Quhat sufferit he for the, O catyve wight!                          15
  Lyis thou at eys, thy prynce in bargane fell?

  Than lat ws stryve that realm forto posseid,
  The quhilk was hecht till Abraham and hys seyd:

THE ELEVINT BUKE OF ENEADOS.




CAP. I.

  _Eftir the feild Enee maid sacrifyce,
  Offerand the spulȝe to Mars, as was the gys._


  Duryng this quhile, furth of the sey dyd spryng
  The fresch Aurora with the brycht dawyng.
  Ene, albeyt hys hasty thochtfull curis
  Constrenyt hym, as twychyng sepulturis
  Of hys folkis new slane and berying,                                 5
  Forto provide a tyme mast accordyng,
  And gretly eik in mynd he trublyt was
  For the slauchtyr and ded corps of Pallas;
  Ȝit netheles, as first the son vpsprent,
  Scheddyng hys bemys in the orient,                                  10
  As victor he onto the Goddis als tyte
  With sacryfyce can hys vowys acquyte.
  Ane akyn tre, was huge gret and squar,
  The branchis sned and kut abowt alquhar,
  Apoun a motys hycht vpset has he,                                   15
  And all with schynand armour cled the tre:
  The coyt armour and spulȝe tharon hang
  Of Mezentius, the vailȝeand campioun strang;
  To the, gret God of stryfe, armypotent,
  In syng of trophe tharon was vpstent
  Hys cryst and hewmet all besprent with blude,                        5
  The brokyn trunschions of hys speris rude,
  And hys fyne hawbryk, with speir, swerd, and macis,
  Assayt and persyt into twys sax placis;
  Hys stelyt scheild dyd on the left syde hyng;
  Abowt hys gorget, or hys nek armyng,                                10
  Was hung hys swerd with evor scawbart fyne.
  And thus exortis Ene hys ferys syne:
  The chiftanys all abowt hym lowkyt war,
  Quhilk glaidsum warryn of this joyus fair.
    O douchty men, quod he, worthy in weris,                          15
  The grettast part of our warkis and afferis
  Beyn endit now, sa that in tyme cummyng
  All feir and dreid ar passyt of ony thyng:
  Thir bene the spulȝe, and first weirly weid,
  Reft from the prowd kyng be my handis in deid;                      20
  Lo, heir Mezentius venquyst lyis doun bet.
  Now to the wallys of Lawrent and the ȝet
  The way is maid to kyng Latyn to wend.
  Tharfor addres ȝour myndis, and attend
  To armys and to weirfar euery ane,                                  25
  Provydand in ȝour consatis for bargane;
  So that ȝhe reddy be, and na delay
  May stoppyn ȝou, nor stunnys ane other day,
  Be ȝour awyn sleuth, for lak of gude forsycht,
  Gif ȝe onwarnyst beys callyt to the fycht:                          30
  Alssone as fyrst the Goddis omnipotent
  By sum sygnys or takyn lyst consent
  The ensenȝeis and baneris be vphynt,
  And all the ȝonkeris meyt for swerdis dynt,
  Of thar tentis convoyt in array,                                     5
  Se ȝhe all reddy be than, but delay.
  And, in the meyn quhile, lat ws to erd haue
  The corpsys of our fallowys onbegraue;
  Quhilk only honour is haldyn in daynte
  At Acheron, the lawest hellys see.                                  10
  Pas on, he said; tha sawlys valȝeant,
  Quhilk, with habundans of thar blude bysprent,
  Has conquyst ws this realm apon sik wys,
  Do honour with thar funeral servys,
  And wirschip with thar finale last rewardis.                        15
  Bot first, befor all corpsis of tha lardis,
  Ontill Evandrys dolorus cite
  Of ȝong Pallas the body send mon we;
  Quham, wantand na vertu nor prowes,
  The wofull day hes ws byreft expres,                                20
  And with a wofull slauchter caucht, allace!
    Thus said he, wepand salt terys our hys face:
  Syne tuke hys vayage towart the ilk sted
  Quhar Pallas lyfles corps was lyggand ded;
  Quham ancyent Acetes thar dyd kepe,                                 25
  With flottyryt berd of terys all beweip;
  The quhilk Acetes had tofor ybe
  Squyer to kyng Evander, from the cite
  Of Parrha cummyn into Arcady,
  And at thys tyme was send in cumpany                                30
  With hys deir fostyr child he had in cur,
  Bot not, as ayr, with happy aventur.
  About the corps alhaill the multitud
  Of servyturis and Troiane commonys stud,
  And dolorus Phrigyane wemen, on thar gys,                            5
  With hair down schaik, and petuus spraichis and cryis.
  Bot, fra that enterit was Eneas bald
  Within the portis of that large hald,
  A huge clamour thai rasyt and womentyng,
  Betand thar brestis quhill all the lyft dyd ryng;                   10
  So lowd thar wofull bewalyng habundis
  That all the palyce dynnys and resoundis.
  Thys prynce hym self, fra that he did behald
  The snaw quhite vissage of this Pallas bald,
  Hys hed vphald, mycht nocht the self sustene,                       15
  And eik the gapand dedly wond hes sene,
  Maid by the sperys hed Rutilyane
  Amyd hys snerth and fair slekyt breist bane.
  With terys brystand from hys eyn, thus plenyt:
    O douchty child, maist worthy tobe menyt,                         20
  Has fortoun me envyit sa far that, eft
  Our weill is cummyn, thus thou art me bereft,
  Sa that thou suld not se our ryng, said he,
  Nor ȝit as victor with prosperyte
  Onto thy faderis cite hame retour?                                  25
  Syk promys hecht I not the lattir hour
  To thy fader Evandrus, quhen that he
  At my departyng last embrasyt me,
  And send me to conquys a large empyre:
  And, dredand eyk for the, that lordly syre                          30
  Vs monyst tobe war and avyse,
  Becaus the men quhamwith to do had we
  War bald and stern; said, we had wer at hand
  With bustuus folk, that weill in stryfe durst stand.
  Now, certis, he levand in hoip, invane,                              5
  For thy prosper returnyng haym agane
  Perchans doith mak prayer and offerandis,
  Chargeand the altaris oft with hys awyn handis:
  Bot we hys lyfles child, quhilk aw na thyng
  Onto the Goddis of the hevynly ryng,                                10
  With womentyng heir menand tendyrly,
  And vayn honour, accumpaneis by and by.
  O fey onhappy kyng Archadian!
  Now thy sonnys ded corps cruelly slane
  Thou sal behald: allace, the panys strang!                          15
  This is our haymcom thou desyrit lang;
  This salbe our triumphe thou lang abaid,
  To se thy a son on hys beir tre laid!
  Ha! quhat, is this my promys and gret faith?
  Bot, O Evander, beys not with me wraith;                            20
  Thou sall not se thy son was dryve abak
  With schamefull wondis that he caucht in the bak:
  Ne thou hys fader, war he alyve this day,
  Suld nevir haue lak of hym, ne for hym pray
  For hys desert he deit a schamefull deth;                           25
  And now with honour hes he ȝald the breth.
  Bot netheles, quhat harm, ful ways me!
  Quhou large support, hey! quhat beld or supple
  In hym hes tynt Ausonya the ryng,
  And quhou gret deill hes lost Ascanyus ȝyng!                        30




CAP. II.

  _Ȝong Pallas corps is till Evander sent,
  With all honour accordyny hys tyrment._


  Quhen he bewalyt had on this maner,
  This wofull corps he bad do lyft on beir,
  And with hym send a thousand men in hy

  Forto convoy and do hym falloschip                                   5
  At hys last honour and funeral wirschip,
  And tobe present at the lamentyng
  Of hys fader, to comfort hys murnyng;
  Thocht smal solace was that to hys regrait,
  Quhilk was sa huge, bot to hys estait                               10

  As man that was fulfillyt of bonte,
  Thar hail desyre full glaidly grantit he,                           10
  And forthir eik onto thame thus he said:

  And rather hes settyn all hys beleif

  Thocht mor equale and ganand war, I ges,

  Till aventour hymself to de in pres.
  Gif he pretendis in batale with a brand
  To end the weir, or Troianys of this land                           30
  Forto expell, heir semyt hym vnder scheild

  And athir towartis otheris turnys, but mayr,
  And can behald his fallow in a stair.
  The eldast man amang thame, finaly,

  For ald malyce or of cryme manyfest,

  He ruschis, plenand on wofull maner,
  And fell on growf abuf ded Pallas beir,
  Wepand and waland as his hart wald breke;
  Embrasyt hym, bot no word mycht he speke:
  And scars at last with gret difficulte                              25
  The cundytis of his voce war lowsyt fre;
  Quhen he mycht speke, than thir hys wordis was:

  And how sweit was renown of chevalry.

  And rycht hard bene the first entechment

  Bot be the contrar I, allace, allace!

  So that this funeral pomp, quhilk heir is wrocht

  Quharto delay I Troianys from the fyght?
  Pas haym in haist, and remember to say

  Evander says that thy ryght hand, Ene,                              25
  Is all the caws that he delays to de,
  Or that this haitsum lyfe sustene he wald.

  Baith to the son and the fader, to set                              30
  Ȝon Turnus slauchter for owr recompens:
  To the Eneas only, but offens,
  And to fortoun, remanys this journay ȝit,
  Quharwith thou may thankfully be acquyt.
  Tell hym, na lust to lyf langar seyk I;                              5
  Onlesum war syk plesour I set by;
  Bot for a thraw desyre I to lest heir,

  With chaftis braid, quhyte teith, and bustuus powis.
  To mak debait, he held intill his hand

  And, quhar he went, amyd the rowtis on hie

  Into the mont Appennynus dwelt he,

  And not, forsuyth, the lakest weriour,                              25
  Bot forsy man, and rycht stalwart in stour,
  So lang as fatis sufferit hym in fycht

  Nor mycht eschaip the queyn, stude him agane;
  Than he begouth assay hir with a trayn,
  And with a sle dissait thus first he said:
  Quhat honour is till a stowt wench or maid
  Fortill assur and trast in a strang hors?                            5
  Leif thy swyft steid, and traste in thyne awyn fors;

  Quhamto this wyndy glore, voust, or avantis,

  Thus said he: bot scho than als hait as fyre,
  Aggrevit for, inflambit in felloun ire,

  And onabasyt abaid hym in the feild,

  The ȝong man, wenyng with his sle dissait
  He had begilit hir be his consait,
  Abowt his bridill turnyt but mair delay,
  And at the flycht sprent furth and brak away,
  And feil sys leit the hors sydis feill                              25
  The scharp irne spurris prik apon his heill.
  O, quod the maid, thou fals Liguriane,

  Thy slycht and wylis sall the nocht beir away,
  Nor hayl scarth hyne do turs the hame fra ws
  Onto thy faderis hows, the fals Awnus.
  Thus said the wench onto this other syre,                            5
  And furth scho sprent as spark of gleid or fyre;
  With spedy fut so swyftly rynnys sche,

  And, with hir beik deplumand, on al sydis
  The lycht downys vp to the skyis glidis.

  Seand this maid onflocht at sik estait,

  And towart hir hys dart adressyt sone.
  With voce expres hys prayer thus maid he:
  O brycht Apollo, souerane God mast hie,                             30
  Of haly mont Soractis the wardane,

  Grant me, fader almychty, now I pray,
  With our wapynnys this schame to do away.                           10
  I ask na trophe, nor the pompos weyd

  And syne that I may to my kynd cite

  And in the clowdy blastis of the sky

  So that, als fast as from hys hand, that stond,

  The rowtis can aduert and takis tent,
  Turnand thar syghtis, ilk wight, with a blent

  Quhill that the lance hir smate and hurt, perfay,
  Quhar that hir pap was schorn and cut away,
  And weggyt deip within hir cost stude,

  And sone thai claucht and lappyt in thar armys

  Bot fyrst of all, for feyr and fell affray,
  Thys Aruns fled full fast and brak away,                            20
  With blythnes mydlyt havand paynfull dreid:
  For he na langar durst into this neyd
  Assure forto debait hym with hys speir,
  Na ȝit abyd the virgynys wapyn, for feyr.
  And lyke as that the wild wolf in hys rage                          25
  Knawand hys recent falt and gret owtrage,
  Quhen that he hes sum gret ȝong oxin slane,
  Or than weryit the nolt hyrd on the plane,
  Tofor hys fays with wapynnys hym persew,
  Onon is he to the heich mont adew,                                  30
  And hyd hym self full far owt of the way;

  Vnder hys waym lattis fall abasytly,
  And to the wod can hast hym intill hy:
  Nane other wys Aruns, that fleyt wight,                              5
  Fled, and belyve withdrew hym owt of sycht;
  Content only to gyf the bak and fle,
  Amang the thikast pres hym hyd hes he.
    And this Camylla, stervand the ilk stound,
  The schaft hes pullyt of hyr dedly wound                            10
  With hir awyn hand; bot ȝit amang the banys
  The scharp steill hed fixt to the rybbys remanys,
  In a full deip wond and a grewos sayr.
  All paill and bludles swarthis scho rycht thar,
  And in the deth closys hir cald eyn;                                15

  And, ȝaldand vp the gost in the ilk place,
  Onto ane of hir damysellis and ferys,

  Only maste trast, and hald in speciall

  That knew alhaill the secretis of hir hart,
  With quham hir thochtful curys wald scho part,
  That tyme scho spak, and said on this maner:                        25

  Schaw Turnus thir my last commandis, quod sche;

  And fra the cite thir Troianys dryve away:
  Adew for evir! I haue na mar to say.
    Sammyn with that word the renȝeis slyp leyt sche,                  5
  And slayd to grond, nocht of fre volunte.
  Than the cald deith and last stondis mortall
  The spreit dissoluyt from the corps our all;
  Hyr sowpil crag inclynand and nek bayn,
  Bowyt dovn hyr hed that was with deth ourtane;                      10
  Furth sprent hyr armys in the ded thrawyng,
  And fra hir kest hir wapynnys and armyng:
  The spreit of lyfe fled murnand with a grone,
  And with disdene dovn to the gostis is goyn.

  Ane huge clamour than dyd rys on hycht,                             15
  That semyt smyte the goldyn starnys brycht;

  And, netheles, but honour in this sted
  Thy queyn hes not the left in poynt of ded;                         20
  Nor this thy slauchter but ramemberyng

  Forto be tald thou suld onwrokyn be:

  He sal repent the tyme that evir thou stervit,
  And with his deth aby, as he hes servyt.
    Vnder the montane law thar stude fute hoit
  A byng of erth, vphepit like a moyt,                                30

  Of ald Dercennus, kyng of Lawrentanys,

  And, rycht amovit, hir hornyt bow has bent,

  For thai had lost thar lady and capitane:
  The pissans haill and ostis Tyburtane                               10

  The banneris left all blowt and desolait,
  Socht to warrand on horsbak, he and he,                             15
  Frawart thar fays, and held to the cite.
  Nor nane of thame, sa mayt and sa agast,

  With swyft renkis dyndlyt the dusty grond.

  Als dyrk as myst towart the wallys threw;
  On the barmkyn abufe, and turettis hie,

  And thame with glavys war kyllyt and maid end.

  Befor thar wepand wofull faderis eyn,

  Sa thik thame cummyrris the pres throng to the tovn;                30
  Sum hasty and onwarly at the flycht
  Sclakis thar brydillys, spurrand in all thar mycht,

  Lyke with thar hedis the hard barris to frusch.

  Sik thyng to do that tyme and tak on hand
  The perfyte luf thame taucht of thar kynd land;                     10
  And all agast dartis and stanys doun threw:
  The syllys square and hedyt styngis enew,
  And perkis gret with byrslyt endis and brunt,
  Full hastely doun swakkis, dunt for dunt,
  And, for defens of thar kynd wallys hie,                            15

  That now the cite wallys stud in dowt.

  So desyrus of dedis martiall,
  For the hard fatys and strang mychtis he
  Of the gret Jove wald that it so suld be:                           30
  The hyllys heich he left quhar at he lay,
  And from the dern woddis went away.
  And scarsly was he passyt owt of syght,
  In the plane feild cummyn all at rycht,
  Quhen that the prynce Ene with all his men                           5
  Hes entryt in and passyt throu the glen,
  And our the swyre schawys vp at hys hand
  Eschape the dern wod, and won the evyn land;
  So that baith twa with thar haill rowtis at last
  In all thar speid held to the cite fast.                            10
  And na lang space thar ostis war in sondir,

THE PROLOUG OF THE TWELT BUKE.


  Dyonea, nycht hyrd, and wach of day,
  The starnys chasyt of the hevyn away,
  Dame Cynthia dovn rollyng in the see,
  And Venus lost the bewte of hir E,
  Fleand eschamyt within Cylenyus cave;                                5
  Mars onbydrew, for all his grundyn glave,
  Nor frawart Saturn from hys mortall speir
  Durst langar in the firmament appeir,
  Bot stall abak ȝond in hys regioun far
  Behynd the circulat warld of Jupiter;                               10
  Nycthemyne, affrayt of the lyght,
  Went ondir covert, for gone was the nycht;
  As fresch Aurora, to myghty Tythone spows,
  Ischit of hir safron bed and evir hows,
  In crammysyn cled and granyt violat,                                15
  With sangwyne cape, the selvage purpurat,
  Onschet the wyndois of hir large hall,
  Spred all with rosys, and full of balm ryall,
  And eik the hevynly portis cristallyne

  The twynklyng stremowris of the orient
  Sched purpour sprangis with gold and asure ment.
  Persand the sabill barmkyn nocturnall,
  Bet doun the skyis clowdy mantill wall:

  Abuf the sey lyftis furth hys hed,
  Of cullour soyr, and sum deill brovn as berry,                       5
  Forto alichtyn and glaid our emyspery,
  The flambe owtbrastyng at his noys thyrlys;
  Sa fast Phaeton with the quhyp hym quhyrlys,
  To roll Appollo hys faderis goldyn char,
  That schrowdith all the hevynnys and the ayr;                       10
  Quhill schortly, with the blesand torch of day,
  Abilȝeit in hys lemand fresch array,
  Furth of hys palyce ryall ischit Phebus,
  With goldyn crovn and vissage gloryus,

  For quhais hew mycht nane behald hys face,
  The fyry sparkis brastyng from hys eyn,
  To purge the ayr, and gylt the tendyr greyn,
  Defundand from hys sege etheryall

  Before hys regale hie magnificens
  Mysty vapour vpspryngand, sweit as sens,
  In smoky soppys of donk dewis wak,
  Moich hailsum stovys ourheldand the slak;
  The aureat fanys of hys trone souerane                              25
  With glytrand glans ourspred the occiane,
  The large fludis lemand all of lycht

  Forto behald, it was a glor to se

  The lowne illumynat ayr, and fyrth ameyn;
  The syluer scalyt fyschis on the greit
  Ourthwort cleir stremys sprynkland for the heyt,
  With fynnys schynand brovn as synopar,                               5

  _Turnus, persavand the Latyn pepill faill,
  Promittis Eneas allone hym tyll assaill._


  Quhen Turnus knew the Latyn pepill haill

  Quhilk war tofor onbrokyn and stowt of hart,
  And thocht the tyme requiris hym, but abaid,                         5
  Forto compleit the promys he had maid,
  Semyng as towartis hym tho euery wight
  To that effect addressyt thar luke and sycht:
  Than, onrequirit, by insaciabill desyre
  Langang to feght, and byrnand hait as fyre,                         10
  Full hie rasand hys curage and hys cheir,

  Fers as a wild lyoun ȝond in Trace,
  By the huntar wondyt in the chace,
  Quhen the smert straik in hys breist all fast is,                   15
  For ire the lokkyrris of hys nek vpcastis,
  Than first begynnyng to rays hys stern moyd,

  And al for nocht ȝon cowart Eneadanys

  And feght contrar thar chiftane hand for hand.
  Thou ryall prynce and fader, kyng Latyne,
  Do sacryfy and conferm this convyne:
  For owdyr sal I with thir handis twa

  Do put to deth, send down to hell, quod he;
  Lat Latyn pepill syttyng by to se
  Quhou, myne allane with swerd in thar presens

  Or than, gyf so betyd he wyn the gre,                               25
  Lat ws all venquyst to hym subiect be,
  Ȝeld hym the crown enduryng term of lyve,
  And lat hym joys Lavinia to hys wyfe.
    Kyng Latyn tho with sad and degest mynd
  To hym answeris, and said apon this kynd:
  O douchty ȝyngkeir, excellent of curage,

  Thow weldis Dawnus thy faderis realm and land,
  And feil citeis conquest with thyne awyn hand;                      10
  Tharto thou has alsso a gentill hart,

  And kyng Latyn hes gold to geif the eik.

  And in the Lawrent feildis heir besyde,

  And sammyn prent thir sawys in thy wyt.

  And fra my son in law, full wrangwisly,

  And forthir on hym movit a wikkyt weir.

  And quhou fers batellis now persewys me,                             5
  Full weill thou wait, and seis, Turnus, quod he,
  And quhou huge travale thou has tholit and pane,
  As principall maste douchty capitane.
  Lo, twys in batale venquyst haue we be,
  And now scantly within our wallit cite                              10

  And of our huge banys quhite semys the plane.
  Quhou am I sterit thus in purpos feir?                              15
  And quhidder flow I thus oft thar and heir?
  Quhat mad foly all to changis my thocht?
  Gyf that I reddy be and dowtit nocht

  Gif so war Turnus ded war and bygrave,                              20
  Quhat! aucht I nocht far rather end the weir

  Haue reuth and mercy of thy fader ald,
  Quham Ardea now, hys cuntre, doys withhald,

  And for thy saik quhou wobegone is he.
    Thus said the kyng; bot the violent curage                         5
  Of Turnus hie mynd bowit neuer a stage;
  Quha wald with cuyr of medycyne hym meys,

    O thou maist souerane fader, I the pray,
  To salue my honour, thou wald do away

  For me thou takis; and, schortly to conclude,
  Suffir me forto plege my deth in wage,                              15
  For gloryus renovn of vassillage:
  For we, fader, can swak dartis and brandis,
  Nocht with febill bot stalwart rycht handis,
  And of our wondis the red blude ruschis owt.
  To ȝonder provd Troiane, clepit sa stowt,                           20

CAP. II.

  _The queyn perswadis Turnus fra stryfe desist,
  Bot he for batal can agane resist._


  Be than the queyn Amata, all in feir
  Of this onkouth and new maner of weir,
  Wepyng full sor, all dedlyke, full of harmys,
  Hyr son in law Turnus hynt in hir armys,
  That was sa fervent in his ardent desyre.                            5
  Turnus, said scho, thou best belovit syre,
  Be thir ilk wofull terys I the pra,
  And be the wirschip thou aw till Amata,
  Gyf ony honour of hyr or thy kyn
  Twichys or movys into thy breist within,                            10
  I the beseik a thyng, myne awyn knycht;
  Desist and ces to mach Troianys in fight.
  Thou only comfort of our febill eld,
  Thou all our rest, our weilfar, and our beld,
  Haue reuth and piete of my wofull baill:                            15
  In thy power and mycht restis alhaill
  The wirschip and empyre of kyng Latyn;
  Hys hows and famyll, now lyke to declyne,
  In the remanys, and is by the vpbore.
  I the assuyr, and certifeis tharfor,                                20
  Quhat aventour in this fight sall happyn the,
  The selfin chance, Turnus, sall betyd me:
  Sammyn with the, gif thou endis in that stryfe,
  I sal depart furth of this irksum lyfe,
  Nor nevir thrall sall I remane to se
  Ȝon ilk Eneas son in law to me.
    Lavinia the maid, with soir smert,
  Hyr moderis wordis felt deip in hyr hart,
  So that the rud dyd hyr vissage glow,                                5
  And full of terys gan hyr chekis strow;
  The fervent fyre of schame rysys on hie,
  Kyndland mar large the red culloryt bewte,
  So that the natural heit the blude dyd chace
  Our all the partis of hir quhitly face:                             10
  Quhill that this virgyn, in this wofull rage,
  Syk cullouris rendris from hir fresch vissage,
  As quha byspark wald the quhite evor Indane
  With scarlet droppis or with brovn sangwane,
  Or quhar the scheyn lylleis in ony sted                             15
  War pulderit with the vermel rosys red.
    The hait luf trublys for the knyght,
  That on this maid he fixis all hys sycht,
  And all the mair he byrnys in desyre
  Of bargane into armys, hait as fyre;                                20
  Syne to the queyn Amata, but abaid,
  In few wordis on this wys he said:
    O my deir moder, of thy wepyng ho,
  I ȝow beseik, do not, do not so,
  Persew me not thus with ȝour grete and teris,                       25
  Nor quhen I pas onto thir mortall werys.
  In marciall bargane contrary my fo,
  Do wa to present me sik takyn of wo:
  In Turnus myghtis lyis nocht, quod he,
  The chance of deth to mak hym selvyn fre.                           30
  I say, gyf deth this way be to me schaip,
  Now may I not astart, nor it eschape.
  For at this tyme instant my messynger,
  Idmon clepyt, my credens hecht to ber
  Now to ȝone Troiane tyrrand, rehersyng                               5
  My wordis, quhilkis lykis hym na thyng:
  That is to knaw, to morow, als ayrly
  As brycht Aurora in the orient sky
  With rosy chariot lyftis vp hir hed,
  The firmament schrowdyng in cullour red,                            10
  That he move not aganys Rutilyanys
  Hys ostis, nor nane army of Troianys;
  Bot athir half fra batale, for the best,
  Baith sall Troianys and Rutilianys thame rest:
  And lat ws twa, this bargane to conclude,                           15
  Betwix ws only dereyn with our blude,
  And into ȝonder feld, in stalwart stryfe,
  Lat athir seik Lavinia to hys wyfe.
    Fra this was said, fast to hys in he spedis,
  And bad onon do lat hym se hys stedis:                              20
  Behaldand thame reiosys he in hart,
  To se thame stand sa fers with curage smart;
  Quhilk kynd of horsis quhilum, as thai say,
  Orythia, the lusty fresch may,
  Of Athenis the kyngis douchter and ayr,                             25
  As ane maste ryall presand, wonder fair,
  Send from hir cuntre to kyng Pilumnus,
  Was foregrandschir onto this ilk Turnus;
  The quhilk stedis, schapyn at all delyte,
  Excedit far the snaw in cullour quhite;                             30
  To speke of speid, thar swyftnes was ontald,
  For thai the wyndis blastis forryn wald.
  The byssy knapys and verlettis of hys stabill
  Abowt thame stud, full ȝaip and seruyabill,
  And with thar holl luyffis gan thame cheir,                          5
  Dyd clap and straik thar leyndis to mak thame steir,
  Thar lokrand manys and thar crestis hie
  Dressys with trelȝeis and camys honestlye.
  Fra thens onto hys chalmyr went he syne;
  Abowt his schuldris assays hys halbryk fyne,                        10
  Of burnyst maill, and schynand rychely
  Of fynast gold and quhitly alcomy.
  Tharwith alsso hys swerd addressis he,
  Quhat way he wald it oys in the melle;
  Hys sovir scheld assays he alsso,                                   15
  And eik hys tymbret helm with crestis two;
  Quhilk swerd was maid onto Dawnus hys fyre
  Be Wlcanus, the myghty God of fyre,
  That forgyt this blaid and temperit with hys handis,
  Hait glowand dyppyt in the Stigiane strandis.                       20
  Syne with gret fors, enarmyt in all hys geir,
  Full lychtly vp he hynt hys stalwart speir,
  Quhilk tho amyddis the hall lenand stud
  Vp by a pillar huge square and rude;
  Quhilum the spulȝe he byreft from ane                               25
  Clepyt Actor, a capitane Auruncane:
  The schaft he schuke, and branglys lustely,
  Tharto with lowd voce thus can he cry:
    O now thou speir, that neyir failȝeit thy deid
  Quhen I the callyt to my desyre in neid,                            30
  Quhilum the weldit Actor, mast douchty knycht,
  Now the in hand withhaldis Turnus wight;
  Now is the tyme that I maste myster the:
  Forto dovn bet the corps thou grant to me
  Of ȝondir Phrigiane, is skant half a man,                            5
  That with my stalwart handis I may than
  Hys halbrik of hys body to arras,
  Hakkyt, and rent, and persyt in mony place,
  And in the dusty puldyr heir and thar
  Suddill and fyle hys crispand ȝallow hair,                          10
  That are maid creys, and curlys now sa weill,
  Yplet ilk nycht on the warm broch of steill,
  Dekkyt and donk, on hys wifly maner,
  Of fragrant myr and other envnctmentis seir.
    With sykkyn fury rage catchyt is he,                              15
  That thus he carpys till a schaft of tre;
  And from the vissage of this ardent syre
  The sparkis glydis as the hait fyre,
  For veray fervour of the feirfull teyn
  Schynys and brystis furth of baith hys eyn:                         20
  Lyke as the bull, that bargane begyn wald,
  Gevis terribill rowstis and lowis monyfald,
  Or than aggrevit, bustuus, and furthborn,
  Presys hys ire to assay with hys horn,
  Lenand hys spald to the stok of a tre,                              25
  And with hys dynt the wynd to rentis he,
  Or, forto mak debait apoun the land,
  With hys hard clufe vpwarpys fast the sand.
    In the self tyme, na les of curage, Enee,

  Scharpys hym self in furour marciall,
  Rasand hys greif for ardour bellicall,
  And joyus wolx of weir to mak ane end
  By syk proffer and poyntment as was send.
  Syne comfortis he hys ferys dolorus,                                 5
  And mesyt the dreid of sad Ascanyus,
  Declarand thame the fatale ordinans,
  Thar destyne, and Goddis purvians;
  And to the kyng of Lawrenteis, Latyn,
  Twychand this forsaid trety and convyne,                            10
  Bad the messyngeris bair hame but delay
  Sovir answer, as thai desyrit alway,
  And of the peys and trewys, as thai spak,
  Proclame articulis and lawys of contract.

  With drawyn swerd syne the reuthfull Enee

  Now mor benyng than thou was of befor,                               5
  Sweit Goddes, heir me now, I the implor;
  And gentill Mars now takis tent heirtill,

  Or in the fomy seis stremys greyn:

  It is conuenient, and we grant to fle,
  As venquyst folk, till Evandrus cite:                               20
  Ascanyus sall als tyte thir feildis withdraw,

  Ne will I not command Italianys
  Tobe subiect, nor obey the Troianys,
  Ne ȝit this realm desyre I not to me:

  And to this cite, quhar we sall duell at hame,                      15

CAP. V.

  _Quhou Juturna be slycht and enchantment
  Brekis the peax, and hasty batale sent._


  And eftyr that this ilk commonyng
  Thus walxand mare and mare by mony a syng
  Juturna hys systyr dyd persaue,
  And saw the common wlgar hartis wave
  In diuers sentens and ententis seir;                                 5
  Than in amyd the rowtis drew scho neir,
  In form and lyknes of Camertis bald,
  Of nobill blude cummyn and lynage ald,
  And of hys fader the bruyt and renowne
  Was magnifeit in wirschip wondir hie,                               10
  Tharto hym self maste douchty cheveller
  In dedis of armys and in fait of weir.
  Amyd the ostis this wys dyd scho thryng,
  Not onexpert to convoy sik a thing,
  And diuers rumouris in the pres skalis sche,                        15
  Syne siclyke wordis carpis apoun hie:
    O Rutilianys, aschame ȝhe not for feir
  Into sa gret a perrell and danger
  A sylly sawle to put in aventour,
  That for ȝow all sall vndirly sik cuyr?                             20
  Quhidder ar we not equale in our entent
  To the Troianys in number or hardyment?
  Lo, all the Troianys and Archadianys
  Befor ws heir arrayt on the planys:
  The fatall pissans is hail in this sted,
  And the Tuscanys that Turnus hes at fed.
  Sa few tha beyn, ȝhe may behald and se,
  That gif we list mak onset, trastis me,
  The half of all our menȝe gret and small                             5
  Sail not fynd ȝondyr a fa to mach withall.
  Ȝon Turnus, to the Goddis abuf full straucht,
  To quhais altaris hym vowyt and betaucht
  He hes for ȝou, as that ȝhe se, said sche,
  With fame eternal sal vpheit be,                                    10
  As euermar alyve and maist name couth,
  Carpit and sung in euery mannis mowth;
  Quhen we, as thrallys, leif sal our natyve land,
  And onto prowd tyrrantis, hes the ovirhand,
  Salbe compellit as lordis till obey,                                15
  That now, thus sleuthfully, sa fant and fey
  Hufys still on thir feldis as we war ded,
  And for our self list schape for na remeid.
    With siclike wordis the myndis and consait
  Of the ȝongkeris was inflawmyt hait,                                20
  And mair and mar now, all the feld abowt,
  The murmur crepys out throw euery rowt;
  So thai quhilkis air desyrit peax and rest,
  And for the common weill thocht it was best
  To mak end of the bargane on this wys,                              25
  Ar alterit haly in ane other avys:
  For now desyre thai batale, but abaid,
  Prayand God this contract had neuer bene maid,
  And has compassioun caucht in hart, but faill,
  Of Turnus chans, semyng so inequale.                                30
    Thys self tyme eik hes Juturna, I wys,
  Ane other grettar wondir ekit to this,
  And heich vp from the hevyn befor thame plane
  A takyn hes scho schawyn auguriane;
  Syk a syng, that nane other to that entent                           5
  Was mar effectuus nor conuenient
  To trubbill Italian myndis, and mak thame raif,
  And with fals demonstratioun to dissaue.
  For Jovis fowle, the ern, com sorand by,
  Fleand vp heich towart the brycht red sky,                          10
  Befor hym catchand ane gret flycht or ost
  Of fowlys that dyd hant endlang the cost,

  Quhil suddanly this egill with a surs,                              15
  As he towartis the fludis maid hys curs,
  Dispittuusly intill hys punsys he
  Hes claucht a swan excellent of bewte.
  Than the Italianys apon athir syde
  Rasyt thar myndis to se quhat suld betyde;                          20
  And sone the other fowlys heich in the sky

  To chais and to assail thar aduersar,
  A wondir thing to se! vp in the air:
  The lyght thai dirkyn with thar pennys thik,                        25
  And throw the skyis with mony a strake and pik,
  Sammyn in a sop, thik as a clowd, but baid,
  Thar fa thai dyd assalȝe and invaid,
  Sa lang, quhil that by fors he was ourset,
  And of the hevy byrdyng sa mait and het                             30
  That hys mycht falȝeit, and of his clukis rude
  The egil leit hys pray fall in the flude,
  And vp amang the clowdis flaw away.
    Than the Rutilianys all, full glaid and gay,
  With huge brute and clamour lowd onane                               5
  Salust this syng or takyn augurian;
  Syne sped thar hand, and maid thame for the fight.
  And, first of othir, Tolumnyus the wight,
  That was a spa man and diuinour sle;
  Ȝa, this was it, ȝa, this was it, quod he,                          10
  Quhilk oft I visseit and desirit by and by:
  This gud takyn I ressaue and ratify,
  And knawys the Goddis favour in our supple.
  Rutilianys, hynt ȝour wapynnys, and follow me,
  Quham now ȝon vauengeour, ȝon ilk stranger,                         15
  Affrays so with hys onworthy weir,
  Lyke tyll onweldy fowlys on the cost,
  And our marchis with fors and mekill bost
  Inuadis, rubbis, and spulȝeis, as ȝe se:
  He sall, for fer, sone gif the bak and fle,                         20
  Mak sail onon, and hald for euer away
  Throu the deip sey outour the fludis gray.
  Tharfor ȝhe sall all sammyn, with ane assent,
  Assembil now ȝour rowtis heir present,
  And into feild defend, as men of mayn,                              25
  Ȝour kyng Turnus he be nocht reft and slane.
    Thus said he, and with that word als sa fast
  Towartis his fais forganys hym dyd cast
  A weirly dart onon with all his byr:
  The sovir schaft flaw quhisland with a quhir,                       30
  Thar as it slydis scherand throw the ayr,

  With sik affray and hydduus dyn and beir                             5
  The wardis all and ostis war on steir,

  The hartis kyndillis of euery bald syre.

  Of quham this dart hyt ane, thar he dyd stand,                      15

  And at the myddill markyt hym full rycht,
  Quhar as the wovyn gyrdill or tysche

  And smate hym evyn into the sammyn place
  Neyr quhar the bukkill hys sydis dyd enbrace,
  Throw gyrd hys body with a grevos wond,
  And spaldyt hym stark ded apon the grond.

  Wod wraith for wo, sum hyntis swerdis owt,

  And in thar blynd fury, full of fed,

  The rowtis of the army Lawrentanys
  Ran to recontyr thame: and tho atanys

  The Troianys and the Tuscanys wraith and wod,
  With thame of Arcad in arrayt feildis,                               5

  So thik as ony schour of scharp hailstanys,

  Full grewos grew the bargane in all stedis:
  Sum ran to the wyn flacconys for gret ire,
  And sum hynt vp the furnace full of fyre.

  With kyngis ensenȝeis and with crown on hed,
  Affrays sore, at hym dryvand hys steid:

  And with hys styf stok swerd in sik estait

  With eyn closyt in euerlestand nycht.

  For this ilke sacrifice violate in this sted                        15

    Amyd sic sawys, as he thir wordis said
  Forto asswage thar mynd, but mar abaid
  A quhirrand arrow, lo, with fedderit flycht
  At swift randon dyd in hys the bayn lycht;                          20
  Oncertane fra quhat hand that it was sent,
  Quhat kynd of schote, nor of quhat instrument.
  The hie glory of sa notabill a deid
  Is hyd, that nane knew quha it dyd but dreid,
  Nor wist quha wrocht had to the Rutilianys                          25

  Dyd hym avant he wondit had Ene.                                    30
    Quhen Turnus all the chiftanys trublit saw,
  And Eneas sair wondit hym withdraw,
  Than, for this hasty hope als hait as fyre,
  To mell in feght he caucht ardent desyre:
  He askis hors and harnes baith at anys,                              5
  And haltandly in hys cart for the nanys
  He skippis vp and musturis wantonly,
  Furth sprentand throu the feildis by and by,
  And at his will, quharso hym list tobe,
  With hys awyn hand the renȝeis rewlis he.                           10
  And dryvand furth thus into his ire

  Owder with his cart the rowtis he drave away,                       15
  Or, as thai tuke the flycht for gret affray,

  And leit thame thik amang his fays fle.

  Amyd the batale catchys to the fycht

  And sa baldly hys fays dyd invaid,
  With sik slauchter, that piete was to se;
  And sik deray has maid in the melle,                                10

  And this Polus, as he far of dyd stand:
  On far eik slew he of Imbrasyus

  For sa stowt ondyrtakyn, and hym sleuch:
  And ȝit for all his renovn, provit eneuch,

  That he was worthy to weld Achillys stedys.
  Bot to our purpos; this forsaid Eumedes                             15
  As Turnus dyd behald ȝond in the pres,
  On the plane feld thar as he dyd ryde,
  First weill a far way at hym leyt he glyde
  A fleand dart; and furth with that, rycht thar,
  Gan stynt hys horssis and his quhirland char,                       20
  And ferely dyd lepyng from hys cart,

  Lo heir the bundis, lo heir Hesperia,

  Thys is the bontay thai sal bair away

    To hym in feir also has he laid                                    5
  With a scharp castyn hed, but mair abaid,

  And he the renys in hys ryght hand hynt,

  And as this douchty man, sa gud at nedis,                           30
  Thus hang and harlyt was in euery art

  That he hys body mycht nocht kepe nor held,
  To covyr with hys armour and his scheld,
  The speir hym followis with scharp hed and braid,                    5
  And rent hys hawbrik of dowbill plyis maid,

  With hys braid scheild or target evir vp stent,                     10
  And in hys hand held drawyn the burnyst blaid,

  Quham tho, allace, gret piete was to se!
  The quhirland quheill and spedy swyft extre

  And, as he fell, Turnus followis with that,
  And evyn betwix the helm can hym arras
  And vmast roll or hem of hys curas,
  Smait of his hed clenly with hys brand,
  And left the corps lyke a stok in the sand.                         20




CAP. VII.

  _Na mannys cuyr nor craft of surrurgyne
  Mycht heill Eneas, bot Venus medycyn._


  And as Turnus thus in the batale sted
  With the ovirhand sa feil corps laid ded,
  The meyn quhil Mnestheus and traste Achates
  Hes led the bald Eneas of the pres,
  Ascanyus ȝyng with thame in cumpany,
  And to the tentis brocht hym all bludy,
  With steppis slaw furth stalkand all in feir,                        5
  Lenand ilk pays on a lang poyntit speir.
  Wod wroth he worthis, for dysdene and dispyte
  That he ne mycht hys ferys succur als tyte:
  He wrythis, and enforsys tyll owtdraw
  The schaft in brokkyn, and the hed withall:                         10
  He axis help at all thar standand by,
  Quhat was the nerrest way and maist reddy;
  And bad thai suld with a scharp knyf that tyde
  Scheir doun the wond, and mak it large and wyde,
  Rype to the boddum weill, and tak gude tent                         15
  To sers the hyrnys quhar that the hed was went,
  That thai mycht hast thame self, but mair delay,
  To the batale, forto stynt this effray.
    Now was thar than present in the pres
  Iapis, that was son of Iasides.                                     20
  Abuf all otheris to the God Phebus he
  Was best belovyt and haldyn in dante;
  With quhais favour vmquhile strangly caucht,
  This God Appollo gladly has hym taucht
  Hys craftis and his officis, by and by,                             25
  Of diuinatioun or of augury,
  The musik tonys to play on harp waill sle,
  And forto schute and lat swyft arrowis fle.
  Bot this Iapis, fortill prolong, perfay,
  Hys faderis fatis, quhilk as bedrall lay                            30
  Befor hys ȝet, of hys lyfe in dispar,
  Had levyr haue knawyn the sciens and the lair,
  The myght and fors of strenthy herbys fyne,
  And all the cunnyng of vse of medycyne,
  And with sik secrete craftis prevely                                 5
  To leid hys lyfe and tyme mair esely.
  Eneas standis byttyrly chidand,
  Lenand apon a bustuus speir in hand,
  Amyd gret confluens of thir childer ȝyng,
  And eik his son Ascanyus fair wepyng;                               10
  Bot he na thing hym movit at thar terys.
  Than this Iapis, sage and ald of ȝheris,
  With habyt schapyn on furrugyn mak,
  Vprollit weill and wymplit far abak,
  Rycht bissely with hys nait handis tway                             15
  Begouth fortill exem, and till assay
  The wond with mony crafty medycyn,
  And mychty herbys taucht be God Appollyn;
  Bot all for nocht his travale and hys pane.
  Oft with hys rycht hand sersis he, invane,                          20
  To rype the owtgait of the wond sa wyde,
  And forto seik the schaft on euery syde,
  With hys wynrys and grippand turcas sle
  To thrist the hed, and draw furth, pressis he:
  Bot, for na chance that evir betyd may,                             25
  Wald fortoun dres hys hand the sovir way;
  Na thing avalyt hys crafty medycyne,
  Nor ocht hym helpys his master Appollyn.
  And now the grisly dreid, ay mair and mair,
  Our all the feildis walkis heir and thar,                           30
  Nerrar drawys the perrell and affray;
  So that all dyrknyt wolx the cleir day
  Of dusty puldir in the hevyn dyd stand;
  The horsmen all approchis fast at hand,
  That dartis thik amyd the tentis fell:                               5
  Wofull clamour with mony cry and ȝell
  Went to the skyis of ȝong men faucht in feild,
  And thame that swelt, sair wondit vnder scheild.
    Venus hys moder tho, this pane to meys,
  Caucht rewth and piete of hir sonnys dyseys,                        10
  And from the wod of mont Ida in Creit
  Vp hes scho pullit dictam, the herb sweit,
  Of levis rank, rypit, and wondir fair,
  With sprowtis, sprayngis, and vanys our alquhar,
  As that we se on sik verdour spryngand,                             15
  And on the top a purpour flour curland:
  Sik gresis gude beyn no wys onknaw
  To the wyld bestis, quhen that ony thraw
  Thai with the fleand arrow beyn ourtak,
  The hed stikand owther in syde or bak.                              20
  Thiddir brocht Venus this herb; and scho was schrowd
  Baith face and body, in a watry clowd;
  And with the herb alsso mydlit hes sche
  The hailsum thryfty watir wondir sle,
  That from hir brycht lippys scho ȝet in hy;                         25
  And temperis and enbalmys prevely

  The hailsum jus of herb ambrosian,
  And the weill smelland herb hait panaces.
  This ancyent surrigian, Iapes,                                      30
  With sik watir or jus, that he nocht knew,
  The wond mesys, and softnyt hes of new:
  And suddanly the payn vanyst als cleyn
  Of hys body, as thocht it had beyn
  Bot a dyrlyng or a litill stond;                                     5
  All blud stanchit and stud in the deip wond.
  Tharwith baith hed and schaft com owt droppand,
  But ony pull following of manis hand,
  That strenth and fors of new to mak debait
  Restoryt war onto thar ald estait.                                  10
  Harnes, harnes, bryng hym hydder in hy!
  Quhy stand ȝe sa? Iapis gaue a cry;
  And with this word aganyst thar fays he
  Hes first thar spreit inflammyt to melle.
  O Eneas, quod he, I mak ȝou suyr,                                   15
  Throw manis mycht was neuer wrocht this cuyr,

  Bot be sum grettar God, full weill I se,

    Eneas tho, desyrus of bargane,
  Hys lymmys in legharnes gold begane
  Claspyt full clos, and dyd hym self array;
  Bad speid in haist, for he hatit delay:
  He schuke and branglit fast his speir that tyde.                    25
  And eftir hys active scheild was by his syde
  Cowchit full meit, and on his bak full thik
  Sesyt his curace or hys fyne hawbrik,
  Ascanyus ȝyng tendirly the ilk place,
  With all his harnes bilappit, dyd embrace,                          30
  And throw his helmys ventall a litill we

  Quhen this was said, furth at the portis hee,
  Schakand in hand a gret speir, ischit he:
  With hym also to the feild ruschis owt

  Than was the playn ourset, quha com behynd,

  And, for stampyng and fell dynnyng of feyt,

  Persauyt thame thus sterand throw the plane,
  Thame saw also the pepill Ausonyanys,
  And the cald dreid for feir ran throw thar banys.

  A rowt coill blak of the stew, quhar he went.
  Lyke as the bub or plaig of fell tempest,
  Quhen that the clowdis brekis est or west,

  Only Turnus went to seik and aspy,
  And hym allane, accordyng the tretye,

    With dreid heirof the mynd was smyttyn so
  Of Juturna, the verray virago;                                      20
  Quhilk term to expone, be myne avys,

  In siclike wys this Juturna belyfe
  Throw owt the ostis gan the horssis dryfe,
  Circuland abowt with swift fard of the cart                         15
  The feildis our all quhar in euery art,
  And schew hir bruthir Turnus in his char,
  Now brawland in this place, now voustand thar;
  Na be na way wald scho suffir that he
  Assembill hand for hand suld with Enee;                             20
  Bot fled hym far, and frawart hym held ay,
  Writhand hir cartis curs ane other way.
    In na les haist Eneas on the bent
  Hys quhelys turnys and writhis mony a went;
  The man he seirsis throw the effrait routis,                        25
  And on hym callis with lowd cry and hie schowtis.
  And als feill sys as he his eyn kest
  Apon his fa, al tymys he hym adrest
  To chas hym with swyft curs throu the melle,
  On hors that semyt ryn as fowle dois fle;
  Bot evir als oft Juturna ane other art
  Awaywart turnys and writhis hyr broderis cart.
  And thus Eneas remanys all on flocht
  In syndry motioun of ire, bot all for nocht:
  Allace! ne knawis he not now quhat to do:                            5
  Diuers thochtis, and seir consatis, lo,
  Hys mynd in mony contrar purpos sent.
  And as he thus was trublit in entent,
  Mesapus, that on cace was neirhand by,
  And in hys left neif haldis all reddy                               10
  Twa sowpill castyng speris hedit with steill,
  Of quham that ane full sovirly and weill
  Towart Ene addressit leit he glyde.
  Eneas hovit still the schote to abyde,
  Hym schrowdand vndir his armour and his scheild,                    15
  Bowand hys howch, and stude a litill onheld:
  And, netheles, this speir, that scharply schar,
  Of hys basnet the tymbrell quyte doun bair,
  And smait away the creistit toppis hie.
  Than mair in greif and ire vpgrowis he,                             20
  Seand hym catchit with dissait and slycht,
  Quhen that he hes persauyt in his sycht
  Turnus horsis drevyn ane other art,
  Awaywart turnyng sa feill sys his cart:
  Tho mony tymys lowd did he testify                                  25
  Gret Jupiter, quhou that sa wrangwisly
  He was iniurit, and constrenyt to fight;
  To witnes drew he als with gret onrycht
  The altaris of considerans violate;
  And now at last, full furyus and hait,                              30
  The mydwart of his ennemys dyd invaid:
  With prospir chance of batale, sa onglaid
  And terribill to his fays walxis he,
  That hail, but ony differans of degre,
  All goith to wraik; for na man list he spair:                        5
  A cruell slauchter he hes rasit thar.
  All kynd of wreth and breithfull ire now he
  Leyt slyp at large, but brydill, with renȝeis fre.

  Quhat God sall now me techyng to endite

  O Jupiter, was it plesand to the,
  With sa gret motioun of crudelyte

  Smate ane Sucron, a Rutilian strang;
  A grevous wond he hyt hym in the syde,
  Throw owt hys rybbys can the stif swerd glide,
  Persyt hys cost and breistis cundyt in hy,
  Thar as the fatale deth is maste hasty:
  This bargane first fermyt Troianys to stand,                         5
  That langeir fled Turnus fra hand to hand.
  Tho Turnus has rencontyrit in the pres

  Quham, fra thar horssis on the grond doun bet,
  On fut in feild strangly he ombeset:                                10
  And the formast with a lang stif speir

  And at his cart thame hyngis by and by,
  The blude tharfra dreippand, tursys away.                           15
  The self stound Eneas at ane assay,
  Or ane onset, hes kyllit Tanaus,

  Renownyt of Thebes blude, and the ofspryng
  Discendyng down from Echion the kyng,
  And of hys moder born, Peridia.

  _Quhou Eneas segit the tovn agane,

  At this tyme, the bargane induryng thus,

  Into hys mynd scho has put this entent,
  To hald onto the wallys incontinent,
  And steir hys ost the cyte till assay                                5
  With hasty onset and suddane affray,

  And as at he held movyng to aspy

  On euery syde he has castyn hys E;
  And at the last behaldis the cite,

  But payn or travale, at quyet man and wyfe.
  Than of a grettar bargane in hys entent                             15
  All suddanly the figour dyd imprent:

  And on a lytill mote ascendit in hy,
  Quhar sone forgadderit all the Troian army,                         20
  And thik abowt hym flokkyng can, but baid;
  Bot nother scheld nor wapynnys doun thai laid.
  And he amyddis on the knollis hight
  Onto thame spak thus, herand euery wight:
    Heir I command no tary nor delay
  Be maid of my preceptis, quhat I sal say,
  Nor se that na man be sweir nor slaw to ryn;
  Till our hasty onset we will begyn,
  Sen Jupiter assistis onto our syde.                                  5
  Now harkis quhat I purpos do this tyde:

  Les than thai wil ressaue the bridill at hand,

  And ȝon hie turrettis, and tha toppis hie

  May haue refuge to this tovn to releif,

  Of our weirfair, and cheif of iniquyte:

  And with the blesand flawmys in ȝour handis

    Quhen this was said, thai put thame in array,

  And quhou at the Italianys, thus twys
  At syndry tymys, schew thame hys ennemys;                           20
  And how falsly that day thai brokyn had

  And vp the reik all void went in the air,                           15

  Or than tobe his mawche and son in law.




CAP. XI.

  _The quenys deces fra Turnus cleirly wist,
  Went to the sege Eneas to resist._


  In the meyn tyme, as weriour vnder scheild,
  Turnus ȝond at the far part of the feld
  A few menȝe persewand our the plane,
  Quhilk at the stragill fled in all thar mayn,                       10
  Sum deill or than walxis dolf this syre,
  Seand his horssis begyn to sowpe and tyre;
  That euer the les and les joyus was he
  Of thar renkis and gait throu the melle.
  Tharwith the wynd and sowchquhyng of the air                        15
  This feirfull clamour brocht to hym rycht thar,
  Mixt with oncertane terrour and affeir;
  The confusioun of sovnd smait in hys eyr,
  Com from the cyte, of felloun murmuryng,
  Rycht onglaid bruyt of cayr and womentyng.                          20
  Ha, ways me! he said, quhat may this be?
  Quhou beyn the wallys trublit of this cite
  With so gret duyll and sorrow as I heir?
  Or quhou thus ruschis so felloun noys and beir
  And clamour from the tovn at euery part?
  Thus has he said, and can do stynt his cart,
  And all enragit tyt the renȝeis abak.                                5
  Quhamto his sistir tho Juturna spak,
  As scho that was turnyt, as I said air,

  With sic wordis scho ansueris hym fute hait:

  Quhar victory ws schawis the reddy way;
  Thar beyn enew otheris, be my fay,
  Forto defend and weill manteym the tovn.                            15
  Ȝon is Eneas makis the brute and sovn,

  For with na les numbir slane vnder scheild,

  Quhidder gif thou com to that entent to se
  The cruell deth of thy fey brother? said he:
  Quhat sall I do, lat se; quhar sall I now?
  Or quhat succurs promittis fortoun, and quhou?
  I saw myself befor myne eyn langere                                  5

  On me dyd call, quhar as he lay onsound
  At erth discomfyt with ane grisly wond:                             10
  And lo, doun bet and slane in hys defens
  Is not alsso the stowt capitane Vfens,

  Ane Sages, montit on a fomy steid;
  And he was wondit sair, and gan to bleid,
  In the face with ane arrow vndir the E,                              5
  Cryand, help, Turnus, be his name, quhar is he?
  Turnus, quod he, in the and thy twa handis
  The extreme help and lattir weilfar standis:
  Haue reuth and piete of thyne awin menȝe.
  Now, as the thundris blast, faris Ene                               10
  In bargane, so enragit he doith mannays
  The cheif cyte of Italy doun to arrays,
  And into fynal ruyne to bet doun
  The principall palyce and all the ryall tovn;
  And now onto the thak and ruffis hie                                15
  The flambys and the fyre blesys doys fle.
  In the thar wltys, in the thar eyn, but faill,

  Quham he sall cheis or call, into this thraw,

  Quhilk at all tymys thyne afald frend has bene.
  With hir awyn hand doith sterve, now liggand law,
  And for affray hir self hes brocht of daw.
  Only Mesapus and Atynas keyn

  Abowt thir twa on athir syde thik standis
  Arrayt rowtis, with drawyn swerdis in handis,
  Full horribill and austern athir barnage,

  And thou, thus rollyng furth thy cart bedene,                        5
  Walkis at avantage on the void grene.
    Turnus astonyst stude dum in studeyng,
  Smyt with the ymage of mony diuers thyng:
  Deip in hys hart boldynnys the felloun schame,
  All mixt with dolour, angyr, and defame;                            10
  Syne fervent luf hym catchit in fury rage,
  And hys bykend hardyment and curage.
  As first the schaddois of pertrublans
  Was dryve away, and hys rememberans
  The lycht of ressoun has recoverit agane,                           15
  The byrnand sycht of baith his eyn twane,

  And from hys cart blent to the cyte prest.
  Bot lo, a sworll of fyre blesys vpthraw!
  Lemand towart the lyft the flambe he saw,                           20
  Amang the plankis and the loftis schire
  Stremand and kyndland fast the hoyt fyre,
  That caucht was in a mekill towr of tre;
  Quhilk towr of sillys and gestis gret belt he,
  And thar vnder, to roll it, quhelis set,                            25
  With staris hie and batelling weirly bet.
  Now, now, systir, quod he, lo all and sum

  Desist tharfor to mak me langar tary;
  Lat ws follow that way, and thiddir cary,                           30
  Quhar God and this hard fortoun callys me.
  Now standis the poynt, I am determyt, quod he,
  Eneas hand for hand fortill assaill;
  Now standis the poynt, to suffir in bataill
  The bittir ded and all paynfull distres:                             5
  No langar, sistir germane, as I ges,

  Bot, I beseik the, manly as a knycht
  Into this fervent furour suffir me
  To go enragit to batale, or I de.                                   10
    Thus has he said, and from the cart in hy
  Apon the land he lap deliuerly,
  And left his sistir trist and dissolate;
  Thrist throu hys fays and wapynnys all, fute hait,
  And with sa swift fard schot throu the melle                        15
  That the myd rowtis and wardis schuddris he.
  And like as the gret roch crag with a sovn

  Quhen at it is our smyt with wyndis blast,
  Or with the drumly schowris spait doun cast,                        20
  Or than be lang proces of mony ȝheris
  Lowsyng tharfra the erd, and away weris,

  Lyke till a wikkit hill of huge weght,

  With mony skyp and stend baith to and fra,
  Quhill that he schut far on the plane grund,
  And all that he ourrekis doith confund;

  Towart the wallys Turnus ruschit als fast

  Quhar tho the grund wet and bedyit stude
  A weill far way with effusioun of blude,
  And large on breid the skyis and the ayr                             5

  Quhou evir the fortoun standis at this tyde,
  The chance is myne, the fait I mon abyde.
  It is mair just and equale I allane
  For ȝou sustene the payn was ondertane,
  And purge the cryme, so happynnyt now of lait,                      15

  Lat me stand to my chans, I tak on hand
  Forto derene the mater with this brand.

CAP. XII.

  _Eneas feghtis and Turnus, hand for hand,
  And Turnus fled, for he had brokkyn his brand._


  Thys fader than, this gret prynce Ene,
  Herand the name of Turnus cryit on hie,
  The wallys left, and fra the tovn went away
  Richt hastely, secludand all delay;
  Styntis all the wark that he begunnyn had,
  And hoppit vp for joy, he was so glaid:
  The huslyng in his armour dyd rebund,                                5
  And kest a terribill or a feirfull sound.
  Vpraxit hym he hes amyd the place,
  Als byg as Athon, the hie mont in Trace,
  Or heich as mont Erix in Scycily,
  Or than the fader of hillys in Italy,                               10
  Clepyt mont Apennynus, quhen that he
  Doith swouch or bray with roky quhynnys hie.
  And joys to streik hys snawy top on hycht
  Vp in the ayr amang the skyis brycht:
  That is to say, amang all other wightis                             15
  Eneas semyt to surmontyn in hyghtis
  The remanent of all the mekill rowt,
  As thir montanys excedis the knollys abowt.
  And than, forsuyth, Rutilianys egyrly,
  And all the Troian ostis or army,                                   20
  Towart thar dukis dyd return thar eyn;
  The Rutilianys, I say, and eik bedeyn
  All the Latynys that on the wallys stud,
  And all thai als, tofor as thai war woid
  The barmkyn law smait with the rammys fast,                         25
  Now of thar schuldris can thar armour cast.
  The kyng hym self, Latyn, abasyt to se
  Twa men sa byg of huge quantite,
  Generit and bred in realmys far insundir
  Of seir partis of the warld, that it was wondir                     30
  Twa of sik statur, onmysurly of hycht,
  Fortill assembill sammyn into fyght,
  Or forto se thame, matchit on the greyn,
  Dereyn the bargane with thar wapynnys keyn.
    And than athir thir campionys vndir scheild,                       5
  Quhen voydit weill and rowmyt was the feild
  That patent was the plane a weil large space,
  With hasty fard on far hes tane thar rays,
  And can thar speris cast, or thai cum neir,
  Quhil scheildis soundit and all thar other geir;                    10
  Ane marcial batale thai begyn, but baid,
  And athir sternly dyd hys fa invaid.
  So dyd the strakis dyn on thar steill weid,
  The erd granys and dyndlys far onbreid,
  Syne raschit togidder with swerdis, or euer thai stynt,             15
  And rowtis thik thai doublit, dynt for dynt;
  With fors of prowes and fatale aventur
  Mydlit sammyn the bargane thai endur.
  Lyke as twa bustuus bullys by and by,
  On the hie month Taburn in Champany,                                20
  Or in the mekill forest of Syla,
  Quhen thai assembill in austern bargane thra,
  With front to front, and horn for horn, attanys
  Ruschand togiddir with cronys and feirfull granys,
  That fe masteris and hyrdmen, euery wight,                          25
  Abasyt gevys thame place, so brym thai fight:
  For feir the bestis dum all standis by,
  And all in dowt squelys the ȝong ky,
  Quha salbe master of the catal all,
  Or quhilk of thame the bowys follow sall:                           30
  Tha twa bullys, thus stryvand in that stond,
  By mekill fors wyrkis other mony a wond,
  And duschand festynnys fast thar hornys stowt,
  Quhill that abundans of blude stremys owt,
  That can do wesch, bedy, or all to baith,                            5
  Thar grym nekkis and thar spaldis baith;
  That of thar rowstyng all the large plane
  And woddis rank rowtis and lowys agane.
  Nane other wys Ene, the Troian heir,
  And Dawnus son, Turnus, sammyn infeir                               10
  Hurlys togiddir with thar scheildis strang,
  That for gret raschis all the hevynnys rang.
  Thus Jupiter hym self hes atheris chance
  A weill lang space to hungyn in ballance
  Be equale myssour, and pasyt hes alsso                              15
  The fatis diuers of thame baith two;
  Quham the stowt laubour suld deliuer fre,
  And quham the pasand wecht ourwelt to de.
    Turnus at this tyme walxis bald and blyth,
  Wenyng to caucht a stound hys strenth to kyth                       20
  But ony danger or aduersyte;
  He raxis hym, and hevis vp on hie
  Hys bludy sword, and smait in al hys mayn.
  A gret clamour gave the pepill Troian,
  And eik the Latynys quakyng gaue a schowt,                          25
  Full prest thame to behald stud athir rowt.
  Bot this ontraste fals blaid is brokyn in sundyr,
  And ardent Turnus brocht hes in gret blundir;
  For it amyddis of hys dynt hym falys,
  And dissolet hym left, that nocht avalys
  To hym hys strenth, hardyment, and mycht,
  Les than he tak for hys defens the flycht:
  Ȝa, swyftar than the wynd he fled, I ges,
  Quhen that he saw hys rycht hand wapynles,
  And persauyt the plummet was onknaw.                                 5
  For so the fame is, at the ilk thraw
  Quhen he first ruschit in hys cart inhy,
  And gart do ȝok hys stedis by and by
  To go onto the batale the sam day,
  That, for the suddand onset and effray,                             10
  The cartar Metiscus sword he hynt in hand,
  And all forȝet hys faderis nobill brand:
  And this ilk swerd was sufficient a lang space,
  Quhill that he followit the Troianys in the chais,
  That gaue the bak, as we haue said or this;                         15
  Bot alsfast as it twichit and matchit is
  With dyvyn armour maid by God Wlcan,
  And tharon smyttyn in al Turnus mayn,
  This ontrew temperit blaid and fykkill brand,
  That forgit was bot with a mortal hand,                             20
  In flendris flaw, and at the first clap,
  As brukkill ice, in litill pecis lap,
  Quhil the small partis of the blaid brokin in twa
  As glas gletand apon the dun sand lay.
  Quharfor this Turnus, half myndles and brane,                       25
  Socht diuers wentis to fle throu owt the plane;
  With mony wyndis and turnys, all on flocht,
  Now heir, syne thar, onsovirly he socht.
  Troianys stude thik bylappit inveroun
  In maner of a conpas or a crovn;                                    30
  And on the ta half eik a laik braid
  Hym so inclusyt that he mycht nocht evaid,
  And on the tother syde fermyt als was he
  With the hie wallys of the cheif cyte.
    And thocht the wond tarreis Ene sum deill,                         5
  Wrocht to hym by the takill with hed of steill,
  To weild hys kne maid sum impediment,
  That he mycht nocht braid swyftly our the bent,
  With na les pres and haist ȝit, nocht for thy,
  He, fute for fut, persewys him fervently:                           10
  Lyke as, sum tyme, quhen that the huntar stowt
  Betrappit has and ombeset about
  With hys ralys and with hys hundis gude
  The mekill hart swymmand amyd the flude,
  Quhilk thar inclusit neidlingis mon abyd;                           15
  For he may not eschape on nother syd,
  For feir of hundis, and that awfull bern
  Baryng schaftis fedderit with plumys of the ern;
  The rynnyng hund dois hym assail in threte
  Baith with swift rays and with hys questis grete:                   20
  Bot this hart, all abasyt of thar slycht,
  And of the strait and stay bankis gret hycht,
  Can fle and eik return a thousand ways;
  Bot than the swypir Tuscan hund assays
  And nerys fast, ay reddy hym to hynt,                               25
  Now, now, almaste lyke, or euir he stynt,
  He suld hym hynt, and, as the beste war tak,
  With hys wyd chaftis at hym makis a snak,
  The byt oft falȝeis for ocht he do mycht,
  And chakkis waist togiddir hys wapynnys wycht.                      30
  Richt so, at this tyme, apon athir syde
  The clamour rays, that all the laik wyde
  And brays abowt thame answerd, so thai ferd,
  The hevyn our all eik rumlyt of ther rerd.
  And Turnus, fleand, sammyn fast can call                             5
  Rutilianys, chidand baith ane and all,
  Every man clepand by hys proper name,
  To reke hym hys traist swerd for schame:
  And by the contrar, awfully Ene
  Can thame mannans, that nane sa bald suldbe,                        10
  And schew present the deth all reddy heir
  To thar ondoyng, gif that ony drew neir,
  And quakyng for affeir maid thame agast;
  Schorand the cite to distroy and doun cast,
  Gif ony help or supple to hym schew,                                15
  And, thocht he sair was, fersly dyd persew.
  Thus fyve tymys round intill a rays
  About the feild can thai fle and chais,
  And als feill sys went turnyng heir and thar,
  Lyke as befor the hund wiskis the hair.                             20
  And na wondir; for sa the mater lyis,
  To na bowrdyng twichit thar interprys,
  Na for small wagis thai debait and stryfe,
  Bot apoun Turnus blude schedding and lyfe.
    On cace, amyd this feild had grow of lait                         25
  Ane wild olyve to Fawnus consecrait,
  Quharon grew bittyr levys, and mony ȝheris
  Was hald in wirschip with all maryneris;
  At the quhilk tre, quhen thai eschapit had
  The stormys blast, and wallis maid thame rad,                       30
  Tharon thar offerandis wald affix and hyng
  Onto this God vmquhile of Lawrent kyng,
  And tharon eik the clathis bekend vpstent:
  Bot tho the stok of this tre doun was rent
  By the Troianys, mysknawand it hallowit was,                         5
  To that entent to plane the batale place.
  Eneas byg lance or hys castyng speir
  Percays apon the poynt was stykand heir;
  Thiddir this schaft the gret fors of his cast
  Had thraw the ilk stund, and thar fixit fast,                       10
  Amang the grippill rutis fast haldand,
  Weggit full law the lance on end dyd stand.
  The Troiane prynce it grippis in that sted,
  Willyng in hand to pull owt the steill hed,
  With cast tharof to follow hym at the bak,                          15
  Quham he throw speid of fut mycht nocht ourtak.
    Bot than Turnus, half mangit in effray,
  Cryis, O thou Fawnus, help, help! I the pray;
  And thou Tellus, mast nobill God of erd,
  Hald fast the speris hed by ȝour werd;                              20
  As I that evir has wirschipit on thir planys

  With blude scheddyng, and down hewyn ȝour tre.
    Thus said he, and no thyng in vane, I wys,                        25
  The Goddys help he axit; for, at hys wys,
  A full lang tyme wrelis and tareis Ene

  Bot festynnyt sa is in the war the gryp.                            30
  That by na maner fors, thocht he was wight,
  Furth of the stok the schaft vp pull he mycht.
  And as he brymly thus inforcis fast
  To draw the speir, this Goddes at the last,
  I meyn Juturna, douchter of Dawnus king,                             5

CAP. XIII.

  _Quhou Jupiter and Juno dyd contend
  Eneas stryfe and Turnus fortill end._


  The fader almychty of the hevyn abuf,
  In the meyn tyme, onto Juno his lufe,
  Quhilk tho down from a watry ȝallow clowd
  Beheld the bargane, therof na thing prowd,
  Thus spak and said; O my deir spous, quhat now?
  Quhat end salbe of this mater, or quhou?
  Quhat restis finaly now atall? lat se.                               5
  Thou wait thi self, and grantis thou wait, Enee
  Is destinat onto the hevin to cum,
  And for tobe clepit with all and sum
  Amang the Goddis a God Indigites,
  And by the fatis forto rest in pes,                                 10
  Sesit abuf the starry skyis hie.
  Quhat purposis or etlys thou now? lat se;
  Or into quhat beleif, or quhat entent,
  Hyngis thou swa in the cald firmament?
  Was it honest a godly dyvyne wight                                  15
  With ony mortal strake to wond in fight?
  Or ȝit ganand, the swerd lost and adew,
  To rendir Turnus, lo, hys brand of new,
  And strenth encress to thame at venquist be?
  For quhat avalit Juturna, but thy supple?                           20
  Desist heirof, now at last, be the lest,
  And condiscend to bow at our request;
  Ne suffir not thy hyd sorrow, I pray,
  Na langar the consume and waist away,
  That I na mar sik wofull thochtis se                                25
  Schyne nor appeir in thy sweit face, quod he:
  For now is cum the extreme lattir punct.
  Thou mycht, quhil now, haue catchit at disiunct
  The silly Troianys baith be sey and land;
  And eik thou mycht alsso at thyne awin hand                         30
  A fell ontellabill batal rays or weir,
  Deform the howshald, and bryng all on steir
  Be mony diuers ways of fury rage,
  And all with murnyng mixt thar mariage:
  Bot I forbyd ȝou ony mar sic thing.                                  5
    Thus spak and carpis Jove, gret hevynnys kyng.
  Saturnus dochtir, Juno the Goddes,
  Ansuerit on this wys, castand doun hir face:
  O Jupiter, deir lord, certis, said sche,
  Because this thy gret will was knawyn to me,                        10
  On fors tharfor, and incontrar my mynd,
  I left the erd and my frend Turnus kynd.
  Ne, war not that, suld thou me se allone
  Thus sittand in the ayr al wobegone,
  Sustenand thus al maner of myscheif,                                15
  And euery stres, baith lesum and onleif;
  Bot at I suld, gyrthit with flambis red,
  Stowtly haue standyn in ȝon batale sted,
  And suld haue drawyn ȝon Troianys, ane and all,
  Into fell mortal bargane inimicall.                                 20
  I grant, I dyd persuading owt of dreid
  Juturna to pas doun at sik neid
  To hir brothir, and for his lyfe eik I
  Approvis weill, and als dois ratify,
  To vndertak mair than to hir pertenyt;                              25
  Bot I forsuith persuadit neuer, nor menyt,
  That scho suld dartis cast, or takillis draw,
  Nor with the bow mak debait ony thraw:
  I swer tharto be the onplesand well
  Of Stix, the flud and cheif fontane of hell,                        30
  Quhais only dreidfull superstitioun heir
  The Goddis kepis, that nane dar it forswere.
  And now, forsuith, thy will obey sall I,
  And giffis owr the caus perpetualy;
  And heir I leif sik werys and debait,                                5
  The quhilk, certis, I now detest and hait.
  Bot for the land of Latium or Itaill,
  And for maieste of thine awin blude, sans faill,
  A thing I the beseik, quhilk, weill I wait, is
  Na wys include in statutis of the fatis:                            10
  That is to knaw, quhen that, as weill mot be,
  With happy wedlok and felicite
  Ȝon pepillis twane sall knyt vp peax for ay,
  Bynd confiderans baith coniunct in a lay,
  That thou ne wald the ald inhabitantis                              15
  Byd change thar Latyn name nor natyve landis,
  Ne charge thame nother tobe callyt Troianys,
  Nor ȝit be clepit Phrigianys nor Tewcranys;
  Ne ȝit the Latyn pepill thar leid to change,
  Nor turn thar clething in other habyt strange.                      20
  Lat it remane Latium, as it was air;
  And lat the kyngis be namyt euermar
  Pryncis and faderis of the stile Albane;
  The lynage eik and gret ofspring Romane
  Mot discend tharfra potent and mychty,                              25
  Vndir the virtuus titill of Italy.
  Troy is doun bet; doun bet lat it remane,
  With name and all, and neuer vprys agane.
    Than gan to smyle Jupiter the gret kyng,
  That is producear of men and euery thing:                           30
  Systir german, quod he, to Jove art thou,
  And secund child to Saturn ald; ha, quhou
  Sa gret a storm or spait of felloun ire
  Vndir thy breist thou rollis hait as fyre?
  Bot wirk as I the byd, and do away                                   5
  That wreth consauyt but ony caus, I pray.
  I geif and grantis the thi desyre, quod he;
  Of fre will, venquyst, referris me to the.
  Thir ilk pepill clepit Ausonyanys,
  On otherwys callit Italianys,                                       10
  The auld vsans and leyd of thar cuntre
  Sall bruke and joys, and eik thar name salbe
  As it is now, and as thar stile remanys:
  Alanerly thar personys the Troianys
  Sall entyr myddill and remane thame amang:                          15
  The fassonys and the ritis, that nocht ga wrang,
  Of sacrifice to thame statute I sall,
  And Latyn pepill of a tung mak thame all.
  The kynd of men discend from thir Troianys,
  Mydlit with kyn of the Italianys,                                   20
  Thou sall behald in piete and gentilnes
  To go abufe baith men and Goddis expres;
  Nor neuer clan or other nation by
  Lyke thame sall hallow, ne ȝit sanctify
  Thy wirschip, eik and honour, as thai sall do.                      25
    Juno anerdit, and gaue consent heirto,
  Ful blith and joyus of this grant, perfay,
  Fra hir ald wraith hes writhit hir mynd away;
  And in the meyn tyme onto the hevyn hir drew,
  And left the clovd, and bad Turnus adew.                            30
  Thys beand done, as said is, on sik wys,
  This hie fader can with hym self devys
  Ane other craft; and providis the way
  Quhou that he sall Juturna dryfe away
  From helpyng of hir brother intill armys.                            5
    Thar beyn twa vengeabill monstreis full of harmys,
  Clepit to surname Dire, wikkit as fyre,
  That is to say, the Goddis wraik or ire:
  Quhilk myschewos and cruell sisteris twa,
  Sammyn with the hellys fury Megera,                                 10
  Bair at a birth, for na thing profitabill,
  The Nycht thar moder, that barntyme miserabill;
  And all elike wymplit and cled thir trakis
  With eddris thrawin, and harys full of snakis,
  And tharto ekit weyngis swift as wynd.                              15
  Thir wikkit schrewys reddy sal ȝe fynd
  Befor the troyn of Jove, and eik also
  Within the wanys of cruell kyng Pluto:
  Thai scharp the dreid to mortale wrachit wightis,
  Quhen euir the kyng of Goddis by his mychtis                        20
  The deth, or the contagius seiknes seir,
  Disponys hym to send in the erth heir,
  Or quhen that hym list do smyte and affray
  Citeis with weirfar, as deservit haue thai.
  Jove ane of thir, full swipper to discend,                          25
  Furth of the hevin abuf onon hes send,
  And bad hir hald doun baldly to the erd,
  Forto resist Juturnais ire and werd.
  And scho onon doun flaw, to ples the lard,
  And to the grund thuddis with hasty fard:                           30
  Nane other wys than from the stryng doith fle
  The swift arrow owt throw the ayr we se,
  Or, into bittyr vennom wet, sum flane
  Castyn or schot by sum archer Persayn,
  By sum Persayn or man of Cydony                                      5
  The schaft thrawyn, that quhirris throu the sky,
  And, quhar it hyttis, wirkis a wond of pyne,
  Oncurabill by the craft of medycyne,
  And sa swiftly slydis throu the clowdis gray
  That quhar it went nane may persave the way.                        10
  On sik maner the Nyghtis douchtir onflocht
  Throw the skyis doun to the erth sone socht:
  And eftir that scho saw the Troian ostis,
  And Turnus rowtis arrayt on the costis,
  Scho hir transformyt in lyknes of a fowle,                          15
  Quhilk we a litil howlet cleip, or owle;
  That sum tyme into gravis, or stokkis of tre,
  Or on the waist thak, or hows rufis hie,
  Sittand by nycht syngis a sorowfull toyn
  In the dyrk skowgis, with scrykis inoportoyn:                       20
  This vengeabill wraik, in sik form changit thus,
  Evyn in the face and vissage of Turnus
  Can fle and flaf, and maid hym forto grow,
  Scho soundis so with mony hys and how,
  And in hys scheild can with hyr weyngis smyte.                      25
  A new dolfnes dissoluyt hys membris tyte;
  For verray dreid and for gret horrour als
  Vp stert hys hair, the voce stak in hys hals.
    Bot as Juturna soyn on far dyd heir
  Of this fury the quhislyng and the beir,                            30
  The swouchyng of hir weyngis and hir flycht,
  This woful sister hyr hair rent for that sycht,
  With nalys ryvand reuthfully hir face,
  And smytand with hir nevis hir breist, allace!
  Turnus, my best belovit brother, quod sche,                          5
  Quhat may thy sistir help now, wa is me!
  Or quhat now restis to me, wrachit wight?
  Thy life prolong quhou may I? Be quhat slycht
  May I oppone me to resist or stryve
  With sik a monstre? Na, nane wight alyve.                           10
  Now, now, I leif the feild, and goys away.
  O ȝe myschewos fowlis, I ȝou pray,
  Do me na mair agrys trymland for feir;
  The clappyng of ȝour weyngis I knaw and heir,
  And eik the dedly sovndis weill on far:                             15
  The provd command of myghty Jupiter,
  That gydis al thing by hys maieste,
  Dois me not now astart, for I it se.
  Is this the ganȝeld that he rendris me
  In recompens of my virginite?                                       20
  Quharto eternal lyfe hes he me geif?
  Quharto suld I on this wys euer leif?
  Quharto is me byreft the faculte

  For, gif I mortal war, now, now suythly,                            25

CAP. XIV.

  _At Eneas Turnus a stane dyd cast;
  Bot Eneas has slane hym at the last._


  Ene with this instantly list not ces
  Forto recontyr Turnus in the pres,                                  10
  And hys big speir apoun hym schakis he,
  Quhilk semyt rude and squar as ony tre;
  And with a bald and bustuus breist thus spak:
    Quhat menys this langsum delay ȝhe mak?
  Quhy tary ȝe for schame, Turnus, all day?                           15
  Quharto withdrawis thou the so away?
  We pyngill not for speid na curs to ryn,
  Bot we debait suld, this barres within,
  With wapynnys keyn and with our burnyst brandis,
  Togiddir met dereyn it with our handis.                             20
  Do change thy self, or turn at thy awyn eys
  In all maner of figuris as the pleis;
  Gaddir togiddir and assembill now, lat se,
  All that thou has of strenth or subtelte;
  Wys now to fle vp to the starnys on hycht
  With fedderit weyngis forto tak thy flycht,
  Or forto cloys thy self this ilk thraw                               5
  Into sum cavern vnder the erd law.
    Turnus, schakand hys hed, said, thou fers fo,
  Thy fervent wordis compt I not a stro,
  Thy sawis makis me not agast, perfay;
  It is the Goddis that doith me affray,                              10
  And Jupiter becummyn myne ennemy.
    Ne mor he said, bot blent about in hy,
  And dyd aspy quhar that a gret roke lay,
  Ane ald crag stane huge gret and gray,
  Quhilk on the plane, percace, was liggand neir,                     15
  A marche set in that grand mony ȝeir
  Of twa feildis, forto decern tharby
  The ald debait of pley or contrauersy;
  Scarsly twys sax stowt walit men and wight,
  Quhilk now the erd producis, hes sik mycht                          20
  To charge it on thar schuldris or to beir;
  Quham full lychtly Turnus, that nobill heir,
  Hynt in hys hand, and swakkit at his fo,
  And raxit hym on hicht thar vndir alsso,
  And tharwith chargit a full swyft curs ran.                         25
  Bot sa confundit is this douchty man,
  That he ne knew hym selvyn in that sted,
  Nowder quhar that he ran, nor quhar he ȝed.
  Nor felt hym self liftand on the land
  The mekill stane, nor steir it with his hand:                       30
  Hys kneis stummerit, and hys lymmys slydis,
  The blude congelit for feir within hys sydis;
  So that the stane he at his foman threw
  Fayntly throwowt the voyd and waist air flew,
  Ne went it all the space, as he dyd mynt,                            5
  Nor, as he etlyt, perfornyst not the dynt.
  Lyk as, sum tyme, in our swevyn we tak keip,
  Quhen langsum dravillyng or the onsound sleip
  Our eyn oursettis in the nyghtis rest,
  Than semys ws full bissy and full prest                             10
  That we ws streke, and doith adres in hy
  Lang renkis for to mak and ryn swiftly:
  Bot all for nocht, for at the first assay,
  Or in the myddis of the start, by the way,
  All fante we faill, as forfeblit war we;                            15
  The tung avalis not, it will not be;
  Ne ȝit the strenthis in our body knaw
  Semys sufficient to ws at that thraw;
  For, set we pres ws fast to spek owt braid,
  Ne voce nor wordis followys, nocht is said.                         20
  Siklyke wys hes this Goddes myschews
  Ombeset all the ways of Turnus:
  Quhat evir to do by hys strenth etlyt he,
  Scho maid obstakill; all that ganestandis sche.
  Than in hys mynd becom his wittis strange,                          25
  And begouth forto vary and to change;
  And oft he dyd behald Rutilianys,
  And oft the cite with all that ryall wanys:
  He hovirris all abasyt for dreid and feir,
  And gan do quaik, seand at hand the speir;                          30
  Ne can he fynd quhiddir away to wend,
  Nor on quhat wys hym self he may defend,
  Nor with quhat strenth assaill hys aduersar,
  Nor be na ways persaue hys cart or char,
  Nor se hys sistir, that had hys cartar be.                           5
    And as he stud on hovyr thus, Ene
  The fatale dedly speir in hand gan tays,
  And with hys eyn markit and walit has
  Ane place be fortoun to smyte oportune,
  And with the hail fors of hys body soyn                             10
  Furth from hys hand weil far the lance gan thraw.
  Neuer sa swiftly quhidderand the stane flaw
  Swakkit from the engyne onto the wall,
  Nor fulderis dynt, that causis towris fall,
  With sik a rummyll com bratland on sa fast.                         15
  Lyke the blak thud of awfull thundris blast
  Furth flaw the schaft to smyte the dedly straik,
  And with it brocht cruell myschewos wraik;
  Quhilk throu the hawbrik skyrtis persyt has,
  And the extreme bordour gan arras                                   20
  Of hys strang scheild, cowchit of sevyn ply,
  And quhirrand smait hym throw the thee in hy:
  That with the dynt huge Turnus, full onsound,
  With faldyn howchis duschit to the grund.
  Vpstart Rutilianys sammyn complenyng                                25
  With a ȝelloch and cairfull womentyng,
  Quhill all the hillys rumysit thame abowt,
  And far on breid thyk woddis gaue a schowt.
    And Turnus than, quhar he at erth dyd ly,
  Addressis furth full humyll and lawly                               30
  Towart Ene hys syght and eyn tway,
  And strekis eik hys rycht hand hym to pray:
  And thus he said; forsuyth, I haue deserve
  The deth, I knaw, and of thy hand to sterve,
  Ne wil I not beseik the me to spair;                                 5
  Oys furth thy chance: quhat nedis proces mar?
  Bot gif that ony cuyr or thocht, quod he,
  Of ony wofull parent may twich the,

  And me, or than, gif bettir lykis the,

  Onto my folkis thou may rendir eft.
  Thou hes me venquyst, I grant, and me ourcum;                       15
  Italian pepill present all and sum
  Hes sene streke furth my handis humylly;
  Lavinia is thy spows, I not deny:
  Extend na forthir thy wraith and matalent.
    Eneas stern in armys tho present                                  20
  Rolland hys eyn toward Turnus dyd stand,
  And lyst nocht stryke, bot can withdraw hys hand;
  And mor and mor thir wordis, by and by,
  Begouth inclyne hym to reuth and mercy,
  Abydand lang in hovir quhat he suld do:                             25
  Quhen, at the last, on Turnus schuldir, lo!
  The fey gyrdill hie set dyd appeir,
  With stuthis knaw and pendes schynand cleir,
  The belt or tysche of the child Pallas,
  Quhilk by this Turnus laitly venquyst was,                          30
  As we haue said, and with a grews wond
  Slane in the feld, bet doun, and brocht to grund;
  And Turnus, in remembrans of this thing,
  Abowt his schuldris bair this onfrendly syng.
    Bot eftir that Eneas with hys eyn                                  5
  Sa cruell takynnys of dyseys hes seyn,
  And can sik weid byreft thar aspy,
  All full of furor kyndlys he inhy,
  Full brym of ire and terribill thus can say:
  Sall thou eschape me of this sted away,                             10
  Cled with the spulȝe of my frendis deir?
  Pallas, Pallas, with this wond rycht heir
  Of the ane offerand to the Goddys makkis,
  And of thy wikkit blude punytioun takkis.

VEGIUS.


  Towart the evyn, amyd the symmyris heit,
  Quhen in the Crab Appollo held hys sete,
  Duryng the joyus moneth tyme of June,
  As gone neir was the day, and supper doyn;
  I walkyt furth abowt the seildis tyte,                               5
  Quhilkis tho replenyst stud full of delyte,
  With herbys, cornys, catal, and frute treis,
  Plente of stoir, byrdis and byssy beys
  In amerant medis fleand est and west,
  Eftir laubour to tak the nychtis rest.                              10
  And as I lukit on the lift me by,
  All byrnand red gan walxin the evyn sky:
  The son enfyrit haill, as to my sight,
  Quhirlit about hys ball with bemys brycht,
  Declynand fast towart the north in deid,                            15
  And fyry Phlegon, his dun nychtis steid,
  Dowkit hys hed sa deip in fludis gray
  That Phebus rollis doun vndir hell away;
  And Esperus in the west with bemys brycht
  Vpspryngis, as forrydar of the nycht.                               20
  Amyd the hawchis, and euery lusty vaill,
  The recent dew begynnys doun to scaill,
  To meys the byrnyng quhar the son had schyne,
  Quhilk tho was to the neddir warld declyne:
  At euery pilis poynt and cornys croppis                              5
  The techrys stude, as lemand beryall droppis,
  And on the hailsum herbis, cleyn but wedis,
  Lyke cristal knoppis or smal siluer bedis.
  The lyght begouth to quynchyng owt and faill,
  The day to dyrkyn, declyne, and devaill;                            10
  The gummys rysis, doun fallis the donk rym,
  Baith heir and thar scuggis and schaddois dym:
  Vpgois the bak with hir pelit ledderyn flycht,
  The lark discendis from the skyis hycht,
  Syngand hir complyng sang, eftir hir gys,                           15
  To tak hir rest, at matyn hour to rys:
  Owt our the swyre swymmys the soppis of myst,
  The nycht furthspred hir cloke with sabill lyst,
  That all the bewte of the fructuus feld
  Was with the erthis vmbrage cleyn ourheld;                          20
  Baith man and beste, fyrth, flude, and woddis wild,
  Involuyt in tha schaddois warryn syld.
  Still war the fowlis fleis in the air,
  All stoir and catall seysit in thar lair,
  And euery thing, quharso thame lykis best,                          25
  Bownys to tak the hailsum nychtis rest
  Eftir the days laubour and the heyt.
  Closs warryn all and at thar soft quyet,
  But sterage or removing, he or sche,
  Owder best, byrd, fysch, fowle, by land or sey:                     30
  And schortlie, euery thing that doith repare
  In firth or feild, flude, forest, erth or ayr,
  Or in the scroggis, or the buskis ronk,
  Lakis, marrasis, or thir pulys donk,
  Astabillit lyggis still to slepe, and restis;                        5
  Be the smaill byrdis syttand on thar nestis,
  The litill mygeis, and the vrusum fleys,
  Laboryus emmotis, and the bissy beys;
  Als weill the wild as the taym bestiall,
  And euery othir thingis gret and small,                             10
  Owtak the mery nychtgaill, Philomeyn,
  That on the thorn sat syngand fra the spleyn.
    Quhais myrthfull notis langyng fortil heir,
  Ontill a garth vndir a greyn lawrer
  I walk onon, and in a sege down sat,                                15
  Now musyng apon this and now on that.
  I se the poill, and eik the Vrsis brycht,
  And hornyt Lucyne castand bot dym lycht,
  Becaus the symmyr skyis schayn sa cleir;
  Goldyn Venus, the mastres of the ȝeir,                              20
  And gentill Jove, with hir participate,
  Thar bewtuus bemys sched in blyth estait:
  That schortly, thar as I was lenyt doun,
  For nychtis silens, and this byrdis sovn,
  On sleip I slaid: quhar sone I saw appeir                           25
  Ane agit man, and said; quhat dois thou heir
  Vndir my tre, and willyst me na gude?
  Me thocht I lurkit vp vnder my hude
  To spy this ald, that was als stern of spech
  As he had beyn ane medicyner or lech;                               30
  And weill persavit that hys weid was strange,
  Tharto so ald, that it had not beyn change,
  Be my consait, fully that fourty ȝeir,
  For it was threidbair into placis seir:
  Syde was this habyt, round, and closyng meit,                        5
  That strekit to the grund doun our his feit;
  And on his hed of lawrer tre a crown,
  Lyke to sum poet of the ald fassoun.
    Me thocht I said to hym with reuerens;
  Fader, gif I haue done ȝou ony offens,                              10
  I sall amend, gif it lyis in my mycht;
  Bot suythfastly, gyf I haue perfyte sycht,
  Onto my doym, I saw ȝou nevir ayr:
  Fayn wald I wyt quhen, on quhat wys, or quhar,
  Aganyst ȝou trespassit ocht haue I.                                 15
  Weill, quod the tother, wald thou mercy cry
  And mak amendis, I sal remyt this falt;
  Bot, other ways, that sete salbe full salt.
  Knawis thou not Mapheus Vegius, the poet,
  That onto Virgillis lusty bukis sweit                               20
  The thretteyn buke ekit Eneadane?
  I am the sammyn, and of the na thyng fayn,
  That hes the tother twelf into thy toung
  Translait of new, thai may be red and soung
  Our Albyon ile into ȝour wlgar leid;                                25
  Bot to my buke ȝit lyst the tak na heid.
    Mastir, I said, I heir weill quhat ȝhe say,
  And in this cace of perdon I ȝou pray:
  Not that I haue ȝou ony thing offendit,
  Bot rathir that I haue my tyme mysspendit,                          30
  So lang on Virgillis volume forto stair,
  And laid on syde full mony grave mater,
  That, wald I now write in that trety more,
  Quhat suld folk deym bot all my tyme forlore?
  Als, syndry haldis, fader, trastis me,                               5
  Ȝour buke ekit but ony necessite,
  As to the text accordyng neuer a deill,
  Mair than langis to the cart the fift quheill.
  Thus, sen ȝhe beyn a cristyn man, at large
  Lay na sik thing, I pray ȝou, to my charge;                         10
  It may suffys Virgill is at ane end.
  I wait the story of Jherom is to ȝou kend,
  Quhou he was dung and best intill hys sleip,
  For he to gentilis bukis gaif sik keip.
  Full scharp repreif to sum is write, ȝe wist,                       15
  In this sentens of the haly Psalmyst;
  Thai ar corruppit and maid abhominabill
  In thar studeyng thingis onprofitabill:
  Thus sair me dredis I sal thoill a heit,
  For the grave study I haue so long forleit.                         20
    Ȝa, smy, quod he, wald thou eschape me swa?
  In faith we sall nocht thus part or we ga!
  Quhou think we he essonȝeis hym to astart,
  As all for consciens and devoit hart,
  Fenȝeand hym Jherom forto contyrfeit,                               25
  Quhar as he lyggis bedovyn, lo, in sweit!
  I lat the wyt I am nane hethyn wight;
  And gif thou has afore tyme gayn onrycht,
  Followand sa lang Virgill, a gentile clerk,
  Quhy schrynkis thou with my schort cristyn wark?                    30
  For thocht it be bot poetry we say,
  My buke and Virgillis morall beyn, baith tway:
  Len me a fourteyn nycht, how evir it be,
  Or, be the faderis sawle me gat, quod he,
  Thou salt deir by that evir thou Virgill knew.                       5
  And, with that word, doun of the sete me drew:
  Syne to me with hys club he maid a braid,
  And twenty rowtis apon my riggyng laid,
  Quhil _Deo_, _Deo_, mercy dyd I cry;
  And, be my rycht hand strekit vp inhy,                              10
  Hecht to translait his buke, in honour of God
  And hys Apostolis twelf, in the numbir od.
    He, glaid tharof, me be the hand vptuke;
  Syne went away, and I for feir awoik,
  And blent abowt to the north est weill far,                         15
  Saw gentill Jubar schynand, the day star,
  And Chiron, clepit the syng of Sagittary,
  That walkis the symmyrris nycht, to bed gan cary.
  Ȝondyr dovn dwynys the evyn sky away,
  And vpspryngis the brycht dawyng of day                             20
  Intill ane other place nocht far in sundir,
  That to behald was plesans, and half wondir:
  Furth quynchyng gan the starris, one be one,
  That now is left bot Lucifer allone.
  And forthirmor to blason this new day,                              25
  Quha mycht discryve the byrdis blisfull bay?
  Belyve on weyng the bissy lark vpsprang,
  To salus the blyth morrow with hir sang:
  Sone our the feildis schynys the lycht cleir,
  Welcum to pilgrym baith and lauborer:                               30
  Tyte on hys hynys gaif the greif a cry,
  Awaik on fut, go till our husbandry;
  And the hyrd callis furth apon hys page,
  Do dryve the catall to thar pasturage:
  The hynys wife clepis vp Katheryn and Gill;                          5
  Ȝa, dame, said thai, God wait, with a gude will.
  The dewy greyn, pulderit with daseis gay,
  Schew on the swerd a cullour dapill gray;
  The mysty vapouris spryngand vp full sweit,
  Maist confortabill to glaid all manis spreit;                       10
  Tharto, thir byrdis syngis in the schawys,
  As menstralis playng, _The joly day now dawys_.
    Than thocht I thus: I will my cunnand kepe,
  I will not be a daw, I will not slepe,
  I will compleit my promys schortly, thus                            15
  Maid to the poet master Mapheus,
  And mak vpwark heirof, and cloys our buke,
  That I may syne bot on grave materis luke:
  For, thocht hys stile be nocht to Virgill lyke,

  Sen eftir ane my tung is and my pen,
  Quhilk may suffys as for our wlgar men.
  Quha evir in Latyn hes the bruyt or glor,

  Lat clerkis ken the poetis different,                               25
  And men onletterit to my wark tak tent;
  Quhilk, as twiching this thretteynt buke infeir,

CAP. I.

  _Rutilian pepill, eftir Turnus deces,
  Obeys Eneas, and takis thame to hys pes._


  As Turnus, in the lattir bargan lost
  Venquyst in feild, ȝald furth the fleand gost,
  This marciall prynce, this ryall lord Enee,
  As victor full of magnanymyte,
  Amyddis baith the rowtis baldly standis;                             5
  That to behald hym apon athir handis
  Astonyst and aghast war all hym saw.
  And tho the Latyn pepill haill on raw
  A fellon murnyng maid and wofull beir,
  And gan devoid and hostit owt full cleir                            10
  Deip from thar breistis the hard sorow smart,
  With curage lost and doun smyttyn thar hart:
  Lyke as the huge forest can bewaill
  Hys granys doun bet and his branchis skaill,
  Quhen thai beyn catchit and all to schakyn fast                     15
  With the fell thud of the north wyndis blast.
  For thai thar lancis fixit in the erd,
  And lenys on thar swerdis with a rerd;
  Thar scheldis of thar schuldris slang away,
  That bargan and that weir fast wary thai,
  And gan abhor of Mars the wild luf,                                  5
  Quhilk laitly thay desyrit and dyd appruf:
  The brydyll now refus thai nocht to dre,
  Nor ȝok thar nekkys in captiuite,
  And to implor forgifnes of all greiff,
  Quyet, and end of harmys and myscheif.                              10
  As quhen that twa gret bullys on the plane
  Togiddir rynnys in bittir gret bargane,
  Thar lang debait mydland quhar thai stand
  With large blude scheddyng on athir hand,
  Quhill athir of thame onto the batalis fyne                         15

  Now thame subdewis vndir his ward inhy
  Quhilk has the ovirhand wonnyn and mastry,
  And of fre will, thocht thar myndis be thra,
  Assentis him till obey: and evin rycht swa
  The Rutilianys, all thocht the gret syte                            25
  Thar breistis had bedowit and to smyte,
  With gret effray of slauchter of thar duke,
  Ȝit thocht thame levir, and haill to purpos tuke,
  To follow and obey, for all thar harmys,
  The gentill chiftane and bettir man of armys,                       30
  And thame subdew to the Troian Enee,
  And hym beseik of peax and amyte,
  Of rest and quyet evirmar from the weir,
  For thame, thar landis, moblis, and other geir.
    Eneas tho with plesand voce furth braid,                           5
  And, standand abuf Turnus, thus he said:
  O Dawnus son, quhou com this hasty rage
  Into thy breist with foly and dotage,
  That thou mycht nocht suffir the Troianys,
  Quhilkis at command of Goddis onto thir planys,                     10
  And by power of hie Jove ar hiddir cary,
  Within the bundis of Italy to tary,
  And, all invane, thame so expellyng wald
  Of thar land of behest and promyst hald?
  Lern forto dreid gret Jove, and nocht gaynstand,                    15
  And to fulfyll glaidly the Goddis command;
  And for thar greif weill aucht we tobe war:
  Sum tyme in ire will grow gret Jupiter,
  And oft remembrans of the wikkit wraik
  Solistis the Goddis tharof vengeans to take.                        20
  Lo, now of all sik furour and effeir
  The lattir meith and term is present heir,
  Quhar thou aganyst resoun and equyte,
  Aganyst lawte, and brokyn all vnyte
  Of consideratioun sworn and bund or now,                            25
  The Troian pepill sair trublit hes thow.
  Behald and se the extreme fynale day,
  To geif all otheris gud exempill for ay,
  That it mot nevir lefull be agane
  Tyll ony to contempne gret Jove invane,                             30
  As forto rays with sik dreid and effeir

  Now beis glaid, bruke thyne armour but pled:

  The gret Turnus! and, as to my demyng,                               5
  Lavynya has the cost na litill thyng:
  Nor thou na schame nedys thynk in na part,
  That of Eneas hand thou kyllit art.
  Now cumys heir Rutilianys, but delay,
  The body of ȝour duke turs hyne away;                               10
  I grant ȝou baith the armour and the man:
  Hald on, and do tharto all that ȝe can,
  As langis onto the honor of bereyng,
  Or to bewail the deth of sik a kyng.
  Bot the gret pasand gyrdill, and sik geir                           15
  That Pallas, my deir frend, was wont to weir,
  To Evander I will send, for tobe
  Na litill solace to hym, quhen he sall se
  Hys felloun fa is kyllit thus, and knaw,
  Full glaid tharof, Turnus is brocht of daw.                         20
  And netheles now, ȝe Italianys,
  That otherwys be clepe Ausonyanys,

  With bettir aspectis and happy begynnyng
  To move and tak on hand debait or weir:                             25
  For, be the blyssit sternys brycht I sweir,
  Neuir nane ostis nor ȝit armour glaidly
  Aganyst ȝou in batal movit I;
  Bot constrenyt by ȝour fury, as is kend,
  With all my fors I set me to defend                                 30
  The Troian party and our awyn ofspryng,
  As, lo, forsuyth this was bot lesum thing.
    No mor Eneas said, bot tharwithall
  Addressys hym towart hys cite wall,
  And throu the feildis socht full joyusly                             5
  To hys new Troian reset and herbry.
  Sammyn hym followis all the rowt atanys,
  The pissans haill and ȝynkeris of Tewcranys,
  And our the planys, glaid and wondir lycht,

  Throw speid of fut assays by and by,
  And oft with bittir mouth dyd crying, fy!
  And can accus the Latyn pepill all,
  Oft fant folkis and sleuthfull dyd thame call;
  That with thar rerd and bemyng, quhar thai fair,                    15
  For the deray full heich dynnys the air.

  _Quhou Eneas, glaid of hys victory,

  And thocht Ene the bissy thochtfull curis

  Of hys folkis yslane, and bereyng,
  With funeral fyre and flambis accordyng;                            20

  _Quhou Turnus folkis for hym maid sair regrait,
  And kyng Latyn contempnys his wrachit estait._


  In the meyn tyme the Rutilianys ichone

  Of thar duke Turnus, slayn, as said is air,                          5
  Within the cite of Laurentum bair,
  With mekill murnyng in thar myndis enprent,
  And from thar eyn a large schour furth sent
  Of teris gret, as thocht the hevyn dyd rayn,
  And far on breid dyd fyll the erys twayn                            10

  Or quhat avalis now, I pray the say,                                30

  With tha pepill, sa strang, bald, and sage,

CAP. IV.

  _Quhou Turnus corps till Ardea was sent,
  Quhilk was by suddand fyre brynt down and schent._


  The Rutilianys onon all in a rowt
  This ded corps, that slayn lay, start abowt:                        10
  The gentill body of this stowt ȝongkeir
  Thai haue addressit, and laid on a rich beir;
  And with hym eik feill takynnys by the way,
  Reft from Troianys in the bargan, bair thai,
  Baith helmys, hors, swerdis, and other geir,                        15

  Syne eftir this hys wery cart furth went,
  Of Troian slauchter and hait blude all bysprent.
  Furth haldis wepand Metiscus, the carter,
  As he that in the craft was not to leir,                            20
  Ledand the steid bedowyn all of swete,
  And chekis wait of flotterand terys grete;
  Quhilk steid had careit Turnus oft tofor
  As victor hame with gret triumphe and glor
  Full pompusly, apon ane other wys,
  Eftir fervent slauchter of his ennymys.

  And thus wery furth went thai euery wycht

  Betand thame self with wondir drery cheir.
  And kyng Latyn, with all thame with hym wer,
  Towart hys palyce gan return onon,                                  15
  With mynd trublit, trist, and wobygone,
  For sa excelland ded corps as was slane;
  Terys all sammyn furth ȝettis euery ane,

  And maid end in the lattir bargan bald,
  That thus was brocht to tovn ded by his feris                       25
  With sik plente of bittir wepand terys;
  The sammyn tyme with othir dyseys was socht,
  At mekill sad dolour and hevy thocht.
  For, as the Latyn pepill war ourset
  Into batall by Troianys, and dovn bet,                              30
  And Turnus be his hait and recent ded
  Had with bys blude littit the grond all red,
  A suddan fyre within the wallys hie

  And all returnys intill assys red;

  Quhidder so it was onto the Goddis lykyng,
  Or that the fatis befor list schaw sum syng
  Of Turnus deth, in horribill batal slane.
  And quhen the pepill saw remed was nane,

  _Fra that Dawnus his son Turnus saw ded,

  And with large clamour fyllys inveroun
  Thar myndis all; quhou ane ded corps new than
  Was cumand at hand, with mony wofull man,                           20
  And Turnus lyfles laid with mortal wond,
  In feld discomfist, slane, and brocht to grund.
  Than euery wight, trublit and wobegone,
  The blak blesand fyre brandis mony one,
  As was the gys, hes hynt into thar handis;
  Of schynand flammys glitteris all the landis:
  Thus thai recuntyrrit thame that cumand weir,                        5
  And sammyn jonyt cumpaneis in feir.
  Quham alsfast as the matronys gan espy,

  That to the sternys went thar wofull beir.

  And syne, half deill enragit, in a rays,
  With huge sorow smyte, in ruschis he
  Amyd the rowt, that reuth was forto se,
  And apon Turnus corps hym strekis doun,                             15
  Enbrasyng it ongrouf all in a swoun;
  And, alsfast as he spek mycht, hes furth braid
  With wordis lamentabill, and thus wys he said:
    Son, the dyseys of thy fader thus drest,
  And of my febill eild the reuthfull rest                            20

  And vndir cruell bargan, as I may se,

  Quhar is thy worthy valour now becum?
  Quhar hes the douchty constans of thy spreit
  Me careit thus from rest and all quyet?
  Is this the notabill honour and lovyng
  Of thy manhed, and glory of thy ryng?                               30
  Is this the gret wyrschip of thyne empyre?
  O my deir son, quhilum thou bald syre,
  Bryngis thou ws hame sikkyn triumphe as this?
  Is this the rest and eys thou dyd promys
  To thy fader, sa tryst and wobegone,                                 5
  And oft ourset with ennemys mony one?
  Is this the meith, and finale term or end
  Of all laubouris, as we desyrit and wend?

  He that was laitly sa stowt, heich, and bald,
  Renownyt with gret honour of chevelry,                              15
  And haldyn gret throu owt all Italy,
  Quham the Troianys sa awfull felt in armys,
  And dred sa oft hys furour, wrocht thame harmys:
  Myne awyn Turnus, lo now apon sik wys
  Ane lamentabill and wofull corps thou lyis:                         20
  Now dum and spechles that hed liggis thar,
  Quhilum in all Italy none sa fair,

  Nor nane so byg but harnes, nor at defens!

  The glor of Mars in batale or in stowr
  Is conquest with sik aventouris sowr.
  Had thou sic wyll thy selvyn to submyt
  To fervent bargan, and to dedis byt,
  Quhen thou departit of this sted fra me,                             5
  Forto return with sik pompe as we se?
  O haitfull deth! that only, quhar thou lykis,
  With thy revengeabill wapynnys sa sair strikis,
  That thou thir prowd myndis brydill may;
  To all pepill elyke and common ay                                   10
  Thou haldis evyn and baris thi ceptre wand,

  Quhilk gret and small doun thryngis, and nane rakkis,
  And stalwart folkis to febill equale makkis.

  And ȝouth and age assemblys baith attanys.
  Allace, detestabill deth, dyrk and obscur!
  Quhat chance onworthy or mysaventur
  Hes the constrenyt my child me to byreif,
  And with a cruell wond thus ded to leif?                            20
  O systir Amata, happy queyn, quod he,
  Be glaid of sa thankfull chance hes hapnyt the,
  And of thyne awyn slauchtir be blith in hart,
  Quharby thou has sa gret dolour astart,
  And fled sa huge occasions of myscheif,                             25
  Sa hard and chargeand huge wo and greif!
  O Goddis abuf, quhat ettill ȝe mor to do
  Onto me wrachit fader? sen ellys, lo,

  Consumyt is, and turnyt in assis red,
  With weyngis fleys a fowle in euery sted.
  Bot ha, Turnus! mar trist and wo am I
  For thy maste petuus slauchter sa bludy:
  Wantit this last myschance ȝit or sik thing                          5
  To thyne onweldy fader, auld Dawnus kyng.

  Brayand apon that catyve for the nanys,
  With all hir fors assalȝeis scho attanys,
  And, with all kynd of torment, in hir greif
  Constrenys hym with stundys of myscheif.
    This said he, wepand sadly, as man schent,                        15
  With large flude of teris hys face bysprent,
  Drawand the sobbys hard and sychis smart,

  Lyke so as quhar Jovis byg fowle, the ern,
  With hir strang tallonys and hir punsys stern                       20
  Lychtyng, had claucht the litill hynd calf ȝyng,

  The moder, this behaldand, is all ourset
  With sorow, for slauchter of hir tendir get.

  Of hys wys gracius answeris wonderand all,

  With glaid semblant thus first to speke began:

CAP. XI.

  _Quhou Jupiter, for Venus cause and lufe,
  Has set Eneas as God in hevyn abufe._


  Venus with this, all glaid and full of joy,
  Amyd the hevynly hald, rycht myld and moy,                          10
  Befor Jupiter down hir self set,
  And baith hir armys abowt hys feyt plet,
  Enbrasand thame and kyssand reuerently;
  Syne thus with voce expres scho said in hy:
    Fader almychty, that from thy hevynly ryng                        15
  At thy plesour rewlys and sterys al thyng,
  That manis dedys, thochtis, and aventuris,
  Reknys and knawys, and therof hes the curis;
  Weill I ramember, quhen that the pepill Troian
  With hard onfrendly fortoun was ourtane,                            20
  Thou promyst of thar laubouris and distres
  Help and support, and eftir dyseys soles.
  Nowder thy promys, fader, nor sentens
  Hes me dissauyt: for lo, with reuerens
  All the faderis of Italy hes se,
  But discrepans, fully thir ȝheris thre,
  In blyssyt peax my son enioys that land:                             5
  Bot certis, fader, as I vndirstand,
  Onto the starnyt hevynly hald on hie
  Thou promyst rays the maste douchty Enee,
  And, for hys meryt, abufe thy schynand sky
  Hym forto place in hevyn, and deify.                                10
  Quhat thochtis now doith rollyng in thy mynd?
  Sen, ellys, doith the vertuus thewys kynd
  Of this reuthfull Eneas the requyr
  Abuf the polys brycht to rays that syre.
    The fader tho of men and Goddis all                               15
  Gan kys Venus hys child, and tharwithall
  Thir profund wordis from hys breist furth braid:
  My deir douchtir Citherea, he said,
  Thow knawys quhou strangly the mychty Ene,
  And the Eneadanys all of hys menȝe,                                 20
  Ithandly and onyrkyt luffyt haue I,
  On se and landis cachit by and by
  In perrellis seir, and quhou that oft tyme eik,
  Havand piete of the my douchtir meik,
  For lufe of the, for thar dyseys was wo;                            25
  And now I haue, lo, finaly alsso
  All thar harmys and ennoy brocht till end,
  And maid Juno, as that full weill is kend,
  Forto becum frendly and favorabill:
  Now lykis me, forsuyth, all ferm and stabill                        30
  My sentens promyst to compleit, quod he,
  Quhen that the riall Troian duke Ene
  Amang the hevynnys institut I sall,
  And hym to numbyr of the Goddis call:
  All this I grant with gud willis perfay.                             5
  Tharfor, se that thou clenge and do away,
  Gif thar be in hym ony mortall thyng,
  And syne abuf the starnys thou him bryng:
  I sall alsso heich ony of hys kyn,
  Quhilk of thar proper vertu lyst do wyn                             10
  Perpetuall lovyngis by dedis honorabill,
  And doith contempn the wrachit warld onstabill;
  Thame in lykewys abufe the hevynnys hie
  I sal do place and deify, quod he.
    The Goddis abufe alhaill gave thar consent,                       15
  Nor ryall Juno, at that tyme present,
  Lyst not contrary, bot gan perswaid full evyn
  To bryng the gret Ene vp to the hevyn,
  And frendly wordis of hym carpys thar.
  Than Venus slaid discendand throw the ayr,                          20
  And socht onto the feildis Lawrentane,
  Neir by quhar that Numycus throu the playn,
  That fresch ryver, flowys to the see,
  Dekkyt abowt with redis growand hie;
  Quharin the body of hir son sa deir                                 25
  Scho maid do wesch, and vnder the stremys cleir
  All that was mortale or corruptibill thyng
  Gart do away; and syne, at hir lykyng,
  The recent happy sawl with hyr hynt sche,
  And bair it vp abuf the ayr full hie                                30
  Onto the hevyn, quhar reuthfull Eneas
  Amyd the starnys chosyn has his place:
  Quham the famyll and kynrent Julian
  Doith clepe and call amangis thame euery ane
  Indigites; quhilk is alsmekill to say,                               5
  As God induellar, at thar sudiornys ay;
  And, in remembrans of this ilk turn,
  Thai gan hys templis wirschip and adorn.




CONCLUSIO.


  Now is my wark all fynyst and compleit,
  Quham Jovis ire, nor fyris byrnand heit,
  Nor trynschand swerd sal defas, ne doun thryng,
  Nor lang proces of age, consumys al thyng.
  Quhen that onknawyn day sall hym addres,                             5
  Quhilk not bot on this body power hes,
  And endis the dait of myn oncertan eld,
  The bettir part of me salbe vpheld
  Abufe the starnys perpetualy to ryng,
  And heir my naym remane, but enparyng;                              10
  Throw owt the Ile yclepit Albyon
  Red sall I be, and sung with mony one.
  Thus vp my pen and instrumentis full ȝore
  On Virgillis post I fix for evirmore,
  Nevir, from thens, syk materis to discryve:                         15
  My muse sal now be cleyn contemplatyve,
  And solitar, as doith the byrd in cage,
  Sen fer byworn is all my childis age,
  And of my days neir passyt the half dait
  That natur suld me grantyn, weil I wait.                            20
  Thus sen I feill down sweyand the ballans,
  Heir I resyng vp ȝyngkeris observans:
  Adew, gallandis, I geif ȝou all gud nycht,
  And God salf euery gentill curtas wight! Amen.

  Gyf thai speir quhy I dyd this buke translait,

  Quharthrow I haue wrocht myself syk dispyte,                        20
  Perpetualy be chydit with ilk knak,
  Full weill I knaw, and mokkyt behynd my bak.
  Say thai nocht, I myne honeste haue degraid,
  And at my self to schute a but hes maid?
  Nane othir thyng, thai threpe, heir wrocht haue I                    5
  Bot fenȝeit fabillys of idolatry,
  With sik myscheif as aucht not namyt be,
  Oppynand the gravis of smert iniquyte,
  And on the bak half wrytis wyddyr synnys
  Plente of lesyngis, and ald perversyt synnys.                       10
    Quhar that I haue my tyme superexpendyt,
  _Mea culpa_, God grant I may amend it,
  With grace and space to vpset this tynsell;
  Thocht not be far sa largely as thai tell,
  As that me semys, ȝit offendit haue I:                              15
  For weill I wait, our wark to mony a wy
  Sall baith be plesand and eyk profitabill,
  For tharin beyn seir doctrynys full notabill;
  It sal eik do sum folk solace, I ges,
  To pas the tyme, and eschew idylnes.                                20
  Ane othir proffit of our buke I mark,
  That it salbe reput a neidfull wark
  To thame wald Virgill to childryn expone;
  For quha lyst note my versys, one by one,
  Sall fynd tharin hys sentens euery deill,                           25
  And almaste word by word, that wait I weill:
  Thank me tharfor, masteris of grammar sculys,
  Quhar ȝe syt techand on ȝour benkis and stulys.
  Thus haue I not my tyme swa occupy
  That all suld hald my laubour onthryfty:                            30
  For I haue not interpryt ne translate
  Every bural ruyd poet dywlgait,
  Na meyn endyte, nor empty wordis vayn,
  Common engyn, nor stile barbarian;
  Bot in that art of eloquens the flude                                5
  Maste cheif, profund and copyus plenitude,
  Surs capitall in veyn poeticall,
  Soverane fontane, and flum imperiall:
  Quham gif I haue offendit, as thai meyn,
  Deym as ȝe lyst, quhen the wark is ourseyn:                         10
  Be as be may, ȝour frendschip, weill I wait,
  Wrocht mair at me than dyd myne awyn estait;
  For kyndnes so myne eyn almaist maid blynd,
  That, ȝow to pleys, I set all schame behynd,
  Offeryng me to my weriouris wilfully,                               15
  Quhilk in myne E fast staris a mote to spy.
  Bot quha sa lawchis heirat, or hedis noddis,
  Go reid Bochas in the genology of Goddis;
  Hys twa last bukis sall swage thar fantasy,
  Les than na resson may thame satysfy.                               20
  I rak nocht quhidder fulys hald me devill or sanct,
  For ȝou maid I this buke, my Lord, I grant,
  Nowder for pryce, det, reward, nor supple,
  Bot for ȝour tendir request and amyte,
  Kyndnes of blude grundyt in natural law.                            25
  I am na cayk fydlar, full weill ȝe knaw:
  No thing is myne quhilk sall not ȝouris be,
  Gyf it afferis for ȝour nobilyte;
  And of ȝour moblys and all other geir
  Ȝhe will me serve siklyke, I haue na weir.                          30
    Bot as twychyng this our wark now in hand,
  Quhilk oft is said was maid at ȝour command,
  To quhat effect, gyf ony wald inqueir;
  Ȝe may answer, thocht I neid not ȝow leir,
  That Virgill mycht intill our langage be                             5
  Red lowd and playn be ȝour lordschip and me,
  And othir gentill companȝeonys quha sa lyst;
  Nane ar compellit drynk not bot thai haue thryst:
  And quha sa lykis may tastyng of the tun
  Onforlatyt, new from the berry run,                                 10
  Reid Virgill baldly, but mekill offens
  Except our wlgar toungis differens,
  Kepand na facund rethoryk castis fair,
  Bot haymly playn termys famyliar,
  Na thing alterit in substans the sentens,                           15
  Thocht scant perfyte observyt beyn eloquens;
  I will weill otheris can say mair curyusly,
  Bot I haue said eftir my fantasy.
  I covait nocht to prefer ony wight,
  It may suffice I said na thing bot rycht;                           20
  And, set that empty be my brayn and dull,
  I haue translait a volum wondirfull:
  So profund was this wark at I haue said,
  Me semyt oft throw the deip sey to waid;
  And sa mysty vmquhile this poetry,                                  25
  My spreit was reft half deill in extasy,
  To pyke the sentens as I couth als playn,
  And bryng it to my purpos, was full fayn;
  And thus, becaus the mater was onkowth,
  Not as I suld, I wrait, bot as I couth.                             30
  Quha wenys I say thir wordis bot in vane,
  Lat thame assay als lang laubour agane,
  And translait Ovid, as I haue Virgill;
  Perchans that wark sall occupy thame a quhile:
  Ȝit haue I hard oft said be men na clerkis,                          5
  Tyll idyll folk full lycht beyn lukand warkis.
    To ȝou, my Lord, quhat is thar mair to say?
  Ressaue ȝour wark desyrit mony a day;
  Quharin also now am I fully quyt,
  As twichand Venus, of myn ald promyt                                10
  Quhilk I hir maid weil twelf ȝheris tofor,
  As wytnessith my Palyce of Honour:
  In the quhilk wark, ȝhe reid, on hand I tuke
  Forto translait at hir instance a buke:
  Sa haue I doyn abufe, as ȝe may se,                                 15
  Virgillis volum of hir son Enee,
  Reducit, as I cowth, intill our tong.
  Be glaid, Ene, thy bell is hiely rong,
  Thy fame is blaw, thy prowes and renown
  Dywlgat ar, and sung fra town to town,                              20
  So hardy from thens, that other man or boy
  The ony mair reput traytour of Troy,
  Bot as a worthy conquerour and kyng
  The honour and extoll, as thou art dyng.
    My Lord, all thocht I dyd this wark compyle,                      25
  At ȝour command, intill owr wlgar style,
  Suffir me borrow this a word at the leist,
  Tharwith to quyte my promys and beheste,
  And lat dame Venus have gud nycht adew,
  Quhamto sum tyme ȝhe war a servand trew.                            30
  I haue alsso a schort comment compyld
  To expon strange historeis and termys wild;
  And gif ocht lakis mar, quhen that is doyn,
  At ȝour desyre it salbe writtyn soyn.
  And forthir, so that I be nocht prolixt,                             5
  The etern Lord, that on the ruyd was fixt,
  Grant ȝow and ws all in this lyfe weilfair,
  With euerlestand blys quhen we hyne fair! Amen.

  Quha can do bettir, lat se quhar I forvayt;
  Begyn of new; all thing is gud onassayt.

  Far eithar is, quha lyst syt doun to moyt,                          10

THE COMMENT.

  I HAUE ALSSO A SCHORT COMMENT COMPYLD
  TO EXPON STRANGE HISTOREIS AND TERMYS WILD.


_P. 6. l. 15._--_Innatyve_ is alsmekil to say as _inborn_, or that
quhilk cumis till ony person be thar natural inclinatioun of kynd throw
thar forbearis.

_P. 6. l. 18._--Ptholome kyng of Egipt, the famous gret clerk,
astronomour, and discryvar of the warld, that causit lxxij
interpretouris to translat the bibill, had sa gret plesour and delyte
of bukis that he gadderit togidder in ane librar xxxvj thousand
volummys.

_P. 10. l. 10._--Thistory of Saul and the spreit of Samuel rasyt by the
Phitones is in the first buk of Kyngis, in the xxviij. c.

_P. 14. l. 21._--_Oppetere_ is alsmekil to say as _ore terram petere_,
lyke as Seruius exponys the sammyn term, quhilk to translate in our
tung is, _with mowth to seik, or byte, the erd_. And lo, that is ane
hail sentence for ane of Virgillis wordis.

_P. 15. l. 15._--As for _animal_ and _homo_ in our langage is nocht
a propir term, and thai be bot bestis that exponys _animal_ for a
beste. Ane beste is callit in Latyn _bestia_ and _pecus_, and _animal_
betakynnys all corporall substans that has ane saull quhilk felis payn,
joy, or ennoy: and vndyr _animal_ beyn contenyt all mankynd, beist,
byrd, fowll, fisch, serpent, and all other sik thingis at lyfis and
steris, that has a body; for all sik, and euery ane of thame, may be
properly callit _animal_. And thus _animal_ is ane general name for al
sik maner thingis quhatsumeuer.

_Homo_ betakynnys baith a man and a woman, and we haue na term
corespondent tharto, nor yit that signifyis baith twa in a term
alanerly.

_P. 15. l. 19._--_Genus_ is that thing quhilk is common, and may be
verefyt of mony other thingis different in kynd, or of diuers kyndis:
as this word, _a beste_, may be verefeit and is common till al and
syndry kynd of bestis; for a hors is a beste, ane ox a beste, a scheip
a beste, a dog a beste; and swa of otheris.

_Species_ is that thing or word that is common, or may be verefeit
of mony thingis different in numbir: as this word, _a man_, may be
verefeit and is common till al maner of man particular; for Johne is a
man, Thomas a man, Wilyam a man; and furth of otheris. Syk lyke, this
word, _a hors_, is common to this hors, and that hors; the gray is a
hors, the blak a hors, the quhite a hors.

_Sexus_ is the discretioun, diuersitie, or differens in schap, betwix
the mail and the female in al maner corporal creatouris: for thocht a
man and a woman beyn baith of a kynd and natur, yit ar thai different
and diuers in thar schap. Rycht swa is ane hors fra a mair, quhilk ar
bath of a kynd; siklyke, a cok from a hen, a kow from a bull; and swa
is of all kyndis quhar the mail is distinct fra the femell.

_P. 17. l. 13._--This argument excusis nocht the tratory of Eneas, na
his maynsweryng, considering quhat is said heirafoir, in the ij. c. of
this prolog; that is,

  Juno nor Venus goddes neuer war,
  Mercur, Neptun, Mars, nor Jupiter,
  Of forton eik, na hir necessitie,
  Sic thingis nocht attentik ar, wait we.

It followis than, that Eneas vroucht not be command of ony goddis,
bot of his awyn fre wyl, be the permission of God, quhilk sufferis al
thing, and stoppis nocht, na puttis nocht necessite to fre wyll. He
falit than gretly to the sueit Dydo; quhilk falt represit nocht the
goddessis diuinite, for thai had na diuinite, as said is befoir.

_P. 17. l. 25._--Heir he argeuis better than befoir.

_P. 23. l. 1._--Virgille reherssis not Eneas naim, bot callis him _The
Man_, be excellens; as thocht he said, The mast soueran man.

_P. 23. l. 3._--Lavyn, Lavinium, Lawrentum, stud viij. mylis fra the
mowth of Tibyr, and was cyte of the king Latynus; of quham eftyr in the
vij. buyk, quhill the end of this volume.

_P. 23. l. 8._--Quhat is Latium, or Latio, luyk eftyr in the vj. c. of
the viij. buyk. The cite of quham heir is mention was new Troy, quham
Eneas beggit at the mouth of Tibir, and fra Ene bein namyt the Latynis,
and nowdir fra the cyte nor the land.

_P. 23. l. 11._--Of Alba cyte luyk eftyr, in the fyfte c. of this buyk,
and in the fyrst c. of the viij. buyk.

_P. 23. l. 13._--Musa, in Grew, signifeis an inuentryce, or inuention,
in our langgage; and of the ix Musis sum thing in my Palyce of Honour,
and be Mastir Robert Hendirson in New Orpheus.

_P. 23. l. 14._--The poet inqueris quhat maieste or power offendyt of
Juno, quhilk is fenyeit to haf many poweris: sche is clepit queyn of
goddis, mastres and lady of realmys, precident of byrthis, spous and
sistir to Jupiter, &c.

_P. 24. l. 12._--Samo is an ile in Trace, quhar Juno was weddit and
born, as sais Seruius; and ther, as vitnessyth Sanct Jerom, stud the
farest tempil of Grece, dedicat to Juno.

_P. 24. l. 12._--Hir _see_, hir _seit_.

_P. 24. l 21._--Lybia, or Liby, is the thrid part of the warld, callit
Affryk, quham now we call the land or cost of Barbary.

_P. 24. l. 29._--The jugement of Paris is common to all knawis the sege
of Troy.

_P. 25. l. 5._--Hebe, douchter of Juno, and goddess of youth, seruyt
Jupiter of his covp: quhilk, at a fest amang the goddis makand hir
seruice, slaid and schew hir schame in al thar presens; for the quhilk
lak Jupiter gaif to this Ganymedes, son to kyng Troyus, hir office. Of
the ravisyng of this Ganymede ye haf benayth, in the v. c. of the v.
buyk; and of this Hebe sum thyng in the prolog of the vij. buyk.

_P. 25. l. 16._--_And as the Troianys_ &c. First abuyf the poete
proponis his entent; sayand, _The batellis and the man_ &c. nyxt makis
he inuocation, calland on his muse to tech hym thar; _O thou my Muse_
&c. and ther, lyke as his muse spak to hym, declaris the caussis of
the feid of Juno, sayand, _Ther was an anchient Cyte, hecht Cartage_.
Now heir thridly procedis he furth on his narration and history, and
beginnys at the sevint yeir of Eneas departyng of Troy, as ye may se in
the end of this first buyk, and eftyr the deces of his fadir Anchises,
quham he erdit in Sycill at Drepanon, as ye haf in the end of the thrid
buyk; the remanent of his auenturis being reseruyt, be craft of poetry,
to the banket of queyn Dido, quhar thai be then at lenth rehersit by
Eneas in the secund and thryd.

_P. 25. l. 29._--This offence was the ravising of Cassandra furth of
the tempill of Pallas, as ye haue in the vij. cheptour of the secund
buke following. And sum says this Aiax oppressit hir in the tempill:
quhilk Aiax was son to kyng Oylus, prince of Locria, or Locrida, and
his pepyll beyn namyt Locrj or Locranys.

Thocht, in verite, Juno was bot ane woman, dochter to Saturn, sistir
and spows to Jupiter king of Crete, yit quhen poetis namys hir swa,
thai ondirstand sum tyme by Juno the erth and the watir, and by Jupiter
the ayr and the fyre: and for als mekyll as the ayr and the fyre is
actyve, and the watyr and the erth patient, and that all corporall
thyngis beyn engendrit therof, heirfoir bein thaj clepit spowsis. Bot,
for that sum tym Juno betakinys alanerly the ayr, and Jove the fyre,
than, be raison of ther contegwyte and qualite convenient, bein thai
clepit sistyr and brothir: and for that all thyngis, by the influens of
the planetis, starnys, and hevinnis abufe, be maid of thir elymentis,
therfor bein thaj clepit kyng and queyn, fadir and mothyr to goddis
and men. And ferthyr as twychyng this Juno, hir other namys and
proprieteis, I refer to John Bocas in the Genealogy of gentille Goddis,
onto the nynt buyk therof, and first c. of the sammyn.

_P. 26. l. 13._--The cuntre or realm of Eolus, clepit Eolia, lyis
betwix Sycill and Italy, vij. ilandis in the sey, of quham thir be
the namys; Lipara, Hiera, Strongile, Didyme, Eriphusa, Phenycusa,
and Evomynos. And for alsmekyll as thir ilis bene full of cavernys,
with bryntstan blawand and byrnand ondir the erd, that therby, throw
the swouch of the fire, may be persauyt a day or twa befor fra quhat
part or art the wynd is for to cum; and this Eolus kyng therof, as an
naturall man, first be experiens persauit this, and wald schaw the
pepill therby, weill twa or thre dais befor, the wynd was to blaw
from syk an art: for the quhilk rayson, with the rude pepill, was he
namyt kyng or god of windis. And thai put that he had vj sonnys and vj
dochtiris, quhilkis ar nocht ellis bot the xij wyndis, of quham the
namys, to begin at the est and go round abowt, bein thir; Subsolanus,
Ewrus, Nothus, Auster, Affricus, Zephyrus, Fauonius, Circius, Chorus,
Boreas, Aquilo, and Wlturnus.

_P. 26. l. 22._--John Bocas, be Eolus set hie in his chare to rewle
and dant the windis, ondirstandis Raison set hie in the manis hed,
quhilk suld dant, and includ law in the cave or boddum of the stomach,
the windis of peruersit appetyte, as lord and syre set be God almychty
therto.

_P. 27. l. 15._--Ilion, or Ilium, was the cyte of Troy, havand his naym
fra king Ilus, fader to Laomedon. The hayll cuntre was callit Troy
fra kyng Tros, or Trojus, fadir to this Ilus: the awld naim therof is
Phrigia, bot oft bein ather of all ther namys takin for other; as Troy,
als weill for the cyte as the realm. And heir, be a maner dispite,
Juno, for the pepill or gudis of Ilion, namys the hail cyte.

_P. 28. l. 2._--For alsmekill as I hafe said abufe Juno betakinnys
the air, in quham blawis thir windis, and by quham the mater quhareof
windis bein engendrit beyn producit to ther perfection, therfor justly
and of rycht Eolus grantis him to hald his ring of Juno.

_P. 28. l. 15._--Ewrus is heir takyn for the gret est wynd, thocht it
be bot the wind est to sowthin; siklyke, Nothus for the mayn sowth,
thocht it be south to est: and Affricus is takin for plat west wynd,
that is bot sowth sowthwest. And thus heir the thre principall gret
windis contrarius blew attanys apon thaim, and the north wind also in
the nyxt c.; _A blastirrand bub owt from the north braying_ &c.

_P. 29, l. 1._--Here fyrst namys Virgill Eneas.

This cald, sais Seruyus, coym of dreid; not that Eneas dred the ded,
bot this maner of ded: and alsso he that dredis na thyng, nor kan haf
na dred, is not hardy, but fuyll hardy and beistly.

_P. 29, l. 6._--The maner was swa in tha dais, that nobillis slan
in feld tuke ther mouth full of erd, to that effect that in the ded
thrawis nain myssyttand word nor voce suld be hard of ther mowth.

_P. 29, l. 11._--Sarpedon, son of Jupiter and Laodomya, dochtyr to
Bellerophon, was kyng of Lycia; of huge statur, and slane by Patroclus.

_P. 30. l. 5._--Thar lyis betwix Affryk and the ile of Sardynia, amyd
the sey, a hirst or ryg of craggy rolkis, quhilkheyn callit _altaris
of suple or help_, becaus therat, on a tyme, the pepill of Affrik and
Romanys band vp perpetwall payce. And thir schald bankis of sand, heir
nammyt, bein the twa dangeris of the sey Affrican, callit Syrtis, the
mair and the les; mar perellus than Yairmuth sandis or Holland cost.

_P. 30. ll. 12 & 15._--Off Orontes and Lewcaspis sum thing in the v. c.
of the vj. buyk; and of this Pander or Pandarus, in the ix. c. of the
v. buyk.

_P. 30. l. 22._--Of this Ilioneus, and the otheris Troianys heir
nammyt, beyn oft benath maid mensioun.

_P. 30. l. 30._--Neptun, or Neptunus, brother to Jove and Pluto, and
son to Saturn. For that the partis of his heritage lay in Creit by the
sey cost, and for he vsit mekill salyng and rowyng, and fand the craft
or art therof, therfor is he clepit god of the sey. He was alsswa ane
the first tawcht to dant and taym horssis: and onto hym beyn consecret
the fundment of wallis, for alsmekill as it is said he biggyt the
wallis of Troy, or than becaus the watyr inclusyt ondyr the erth is
oft tymys caus of erdqwkyng, and trimbillyng or moving of the erth, as
we se by experiens in watyr brekis. And, perchans, thir thre poweris
signefeis the thre granyt ceptour, quhilk his statw in ald days bair in
hand, lyk a crepar or a graip wyth thre granys. Tha discryve hym rydand
in a cart, quhilk betakinnys the weltyng our of the sey wallys, that
rollys, hurlys, and brais, lyke cart quhelis. Quha lykis mair of him,
go reid Bocas, in the first c. and tent buyk of the Genealogy of Goddis.

_P. 31. l. 15._--Heir is an notabyll doctryn, that nane nobill man suld
hastely reveng him eftir his greif. Tharfor was gevin consell to August
Octavian, the empriour, that eftir his commotioun, or euer he did or
said ocht, he suld wryte xxiiij lettiris.

_P. 31. l. 21._--This thre granyt ceptour in sum part haf I twychit
abuf: it may betakyn alsswa the thre properteis of the water, quhilk is
flowand, drynkabyll, and ganand to sayll or swym intyll.

_P. 32. l. 1._--Cymothoe, as sais Seruyus, is, in Grew, als mekyll
to say in our langage, as the flowand or rinnand flud, quhilk may be
clepit a ganand dochtir to Neptun, god of seys. Trytton, as sais Bocas,
is the bruyt or rowtyng of the wally sey; quharfor justly is he fenyeit
trumpet to the occian, and son to Neptun. Netheles, Plynyus in his
natural history reherssis that Triton is a verray monstre of the sey,
and that in the tym of Tyberius the emperour syk ay was hard and seyn.
His schap and portatour is discryvit in the x. buyk, in the iiij. c.;
and he slais Mesenus in the iij. c. of the vj. buyk.

_P. 32. l. 8._--Noyte Virgill in this comparison and symilytude, for
therin and in syk lyke baris he palm of lawd, as I haf said in my
proheme. It is to be considderit alsso that, our all this wark, he
comparis batell tyll spait or dyluge of watyr, or than to suddan fyr,
and to nocht ellis.

_P. 32. l. 16._--Cristoferus Landynus, that writis moraly apon Virgill,
says thus: Eneas purposis to Italy, his land of promyssioun; that is
to say, a just perfyte man entendis to mast soueran bonte and gudnes,
quhilk, as witnessyth Plato, is situate in contemplation of godly
thingis or dyvyn warkis. His onmeysabill ennymy Juno, that is fenyeit
queen of realmys, entendis to dryve him from Itall to Cartage; that is,
Avesion, or concupissence to ryng or haf warldly honouris, wald draw
him fra contemplation to the actyve lyve; quhilk, quhen scho falis by
hir self, tretis scho with Eolus, the neddyr part of raison, quhilk
sendis the storm of mony warldly consalis in the just manis mynd:
bot, quhoubeyt the mynd lang flowis and delitis heirintyll, fynaly by
the fre wyll and raison predomynent, that is, ondirstand, by Neptun,
the storm is cessit, and, as followis in the nyxt c., arryvit in sond
havin, quhilk is tranquilite of consciens: and fynaly Venus, in the
vj. c. following, schawis Ene his feris recouerit again; quhilk is,
fervent lufe and cherite schawis the just man his swete meditationys
and feruor of deuotion, quham he tynt by warldly curis, restorit to hym
again; and all his schippis bot on, be quham I ondyrstand the tyme lost.

_P. 33. l. 18._--Nympha may be clepit a spows, or a damysell. Bot thai
bein takyn with poetis for goddessis of woddis, wildirnessis, fludis,
or wellis: and Nympha is a generall naym to all syk Nymphis of wellis,
bein callit Naydes; of hillis or montanys, Oreades; of woddis and
forestis, Dryades; of salt fludis, Nereides; of flouris, Napee and
Hamadriades, ar fenyeit to grow and de wyth the tre, as quha wald say
the sawle of the tre.

_P. 34. l. 5._--Ye sall ondirstand, Virgill, in all partis of his
proses, quhat maner or fassoun he discrivis ony man at the begynnyng,
sa continewys he of that samin person all thro; and Eneas in all his
wark secludis from all vylle offyce: bot, as twychand materris of pyety
or devotion, thar labowris he euer wyth the first, as ye may se in the
beginyng of the vj. buke.

_P. 34. l. 13._--Thocht sum wald say, perchans, that in Affrik bein
na hartis, therto answeris Landinus that albeit perchans now ther be
nain, in tha days tha war not to seyk: Or thocht in the ferther partis
of Affrik be nain, in the hiddir partis, quharto was Eneas dryve, ther
beyn mony.

_P. 34. l. 29._--Acestes, kyng of Sycilly; of quham in the first c. of
the v. buke.

_P. 35. l. 7._--Sylla and Charybdis bein twa gret dangeris in the
Sycill sey; of quham in the vj. and viij. c. of the thrid buke.

_P. 35. l. 10._--Off thir Cyclopes alsso, in the ix. and x. c. of the
thrid buyk.

_P. 36. l. 2._--Wyne the eldar the bettir, sa that it be fresch; and
euery man knawis vennyson owt of ply tynys the sesson.

_P. 36. l. 16._--Jove, or Jupiter, by the gentillis was clepit the
mast soueran god, fader of goddis and men, and all the otheris war bot
haldyn as poweris dyuers of this Jupiter, callit _juuans pater_, the
helply fadir; bot quham we cleip swa I haf writyn in my proloug of the
x. buyk. Of Jupiter, as writis Sanct Augustyn in his volume clepit the
Cyte of God, in the vij. buke and ix. c. therof, thus writis poetis:

  Jupiter omnipotens, regum rex ipse, deusque,
  Progenitor genitrixque deum, deus vnus, et omnes.

_Jupiter omnipotent, kinq of kingis, and god, fader and moder of
goddis, an god, and all the goddis._ Of him largly spekis he alswa,
reprevand the gentile opinyonys, in the sam volum, in the first buk and
xj. c. therof; and in the xij. c. repreuys the opynion of Plato, that
haldis God the sawl of the warld. Of Jupiter sais the poet Lucan,

  Jupiter est quodcunque vides, quocunque moueris:

_Jupiter is all that euer thou seis, and all that euer movis._ Bot
quhou ther beyn thre syndry Jupiteris, reid John Bocas in his Genealogy
of Goddis, in the first c. of the xj. buyk, quhar he tretis of Jupiter,
kyng of Crete, quhilk was Jupiter the thrid: and ther, at the full,
of all the fiction and fabillis therof, and quhy he is clepit gret
god, and of this Jupiter in the recollectis of Troy. Of the secund
Jupiter, kyng of Archad, and syne of Athenes, quhich slew Lycaon, and
was fadyr to Dardanus, of quham caym the Troianys, he writis in the
first c. of his v. buyk: and of Jupiter the first, callit Lysanyan,
and kyng Athenes, in the ij. c. of his ij. buke, quhar he tretis the
proprieteis of Jupiter the planeyt. And now to speyk of Jupiter the
planete, quhilk is secund in ordour, and vnermaste nyxt Saturn; he is
gentyll and meyk, and full of gud influens, and profitabill aspectis,
in sa far that gif he conionys with a frawart planete, sik as Mars, or
Saturn, he meysis ther wreth: gif he conjonys with a meyn planete, as
the Sone, the Moyn, or Mercury, he drawis thaim and makis inclyn to his
gudnes. Quhen he conjonys with Venus, or is participant with hir, as he
stud in the ascendent at this tym of Eneas landyng, quhilk is fenyeit
the commonyng betwix hym and Venus, than, as heir apperis, batakynnys
all gud; for Jove is clepit, _Fortuna maior_, and Venus, _Fortuna
minor_. He completis his curs in xij yeris; and, by this constylation
betwix him and Venus, Seruius ondirstandis felicite to cum be a woman;
as followis be Dido: And that Venus was sorofull, that is to knaw,
discendent, and nocht in hir strenth, signifeis the sorefull departyng
and myschans of Dido.

_P. 37. l. 18._--Becaus ther is mensioun of Anthenor, quham many,
followand Gwydo De Columnis, haldis tratour, sum thing of him will I
speyk, thocht it may suffis for his purgation that Virgill heir hayth
namit him, and almaste comparit him to the mast soueran Eneas; quhilk
comparison na wys wald he haf maid for lak of Eneas, gif he had bein
tratour. Bot to schaw his innocens, lat vs induce the mast nobill and
famus historian and mylky flud of eloquens, gret Tytus Lyuius, quhilk
of Anthenor and Eneas sais thir wordis in his beginning: _It is weill
wyt that, Troy beand takin, in all the otheris Troianys crudelite was
exersit, exceppand twa, Athenor and Eneas: to quham the Grekis did na
harm, bot abstenyt fra all power of batell as twichyng thaim, becaus of
the rayson of hospitalite; for thai had beyn ther ald hostis and all
tymys thai war solistaris and warkkaris to rendyr Helen and to procur
paice_. Now I beseik yow, curtes redaris, considdir gif this be punctis
of traison, or rathar of honour; and wey the excellent awtorite of
Virgill and Tytus Lyuius with your pevach and corrupt Gwido. Landinus
sais als of this Anthenor that, for his sone Glaucus followit Paris, he
depechit him of him, and for that sam caus, quhen he was aftyr slan by
Agamemnon, he maid na duyll for his ded.

_P. 37. l. 19._--Ilyria hes his naym fra Illyrus, son to Polyphemus,
and, as sais Sextus Rufus, it contenys xvij provyncis. It extendis
endlang all the gret flud Danubyum, callit Hister, on bayth the sydis,
and in it is Vngary, Pannony, Sclauony, Bohem, Denmark, and Macydon:
and this Lyburnya is bot a part therof, contenand certan ilis. Timauus
is a flud in Lumbardy, in the Venytian landis, that cumis furth of the
Duch Montanys at ix beginnyngis, quhilk all rynnys in a loch, quham
the pepill adiacent callis a sey; and from this loch cumys the flud
that rynnys to Padva, byggit be Anthenor, as heir ye may se. Bot it is
to be notyt that Virgill sais abuf, in the first c., Eneas coim fyrst
fra Troy to Italy; and heir it apperis Anthenor caym befor him. To
that sais Seruyus, tha partis quhamto coym Anthenor beyn not haldyn of
Italy, bot of Lumbardy, callit Gallia Cysalpina: or mayr evidently may
we say that Ene was the fyrst coim to Italy by fait, and at the goddis
command; Anthenor coym at his awin auentur, and nocht be destine.

_P. 38. l. 11._--Venus is clepit Cytherea fra the ile Cythera, besid
Creyt, quhar scho was norysit; or fra the mont Cytheron, quhar scho was
gretly wirscheppit.

_P. 38. l. 13._--The cyte of Rome, or than of new Troy.

_P. 38. l. 15._--The deyfication of Eneas is eftyr, in the last c. of

_P. 38. l. 21._--Of the barganyng or batellis of this Eneas, her in
dyuers bukis followand; and of the beldyng of this cyte, and how lang
his ryng endurit, in the last and penult c. of the xiij. buyk.

_P. 38. l. 29._--Julus is thre sillabis, spellit wyth i _per se_ and v
_per se_.

_P. 39. l. 4._--The cite Alba, biggit by Ascanius son of Creusa, eftyr
Virgill had his naim fra the quhite swyn, as ye may se in the first c.
of the viij. buk; and was clepit Lang Alba, for it was set end lang the
band or ryg of a law hill, as writis Tytus Lyuius, and was distroit by
Tullus Hostilius, thrid king of Rom; and tharof in the xj. c. of the
xiij. buke.

_P. 39. l. 6._--Pepill Hectorean, hardy as Hector, or of the kinrent
and blude of Hector; for this Ascanyus was his fift son.

_P. 39. l. 11._--Of Romulus ye sall knaw, that Porcas, the xj kyng of
Alba or Albanys, gat twa sonys, Numytor and Amulyus, betwyx quham he
dividit his realm. Bot this Amulyus banyst his brother Numytor, and
slew his son Lawsus, and his dochtir, callit Ilya or Rhea, consecrat a
nun onto the goddes Vesta, to that effect scho suld haf na succession;
for in tha dais sik nunis, gif thai brak ther virginite, war eyrdit
qwyk. Bot this Ilia consauyt and brocht furth twa childyr mayll, quham
thai fenze to haf beyn engendyrit of Mars, becaus thai war bellicos
and chevalrus, and bygettin of sum dowchti man; and than this Amulyus
gart put this Ilia to ded, and bad kast tha childyr in Tybyr. Bot the
flud be an speyt was flowyn sa far our the brays thai mycht nocht wyn
to the crocis of the water, and thus war thai left on the bra; and ane
Fastulus, an hyrd, had thaim born to his hows, and maid Acca his wyf,
other wys callyt Lupa, nuryce thaim: and, for that Lupa batakinnys a
wolf, and scho was callit Lupa, therfor is it said a wolf fosterit
Romulus and Remus. And becaus this said Acca or Lupa maid Romulus
hir ayr, therfor sais Virgill he was cled in his motheris or nuryce
tawbart. And eftyr, quhen thai worth men, thai becam for the nanys
briggantis of the wod, and by a maner pollycy or practyk convenyt
that the tayn of thaim suld tak his brother and all his complicis,
and sa thai did, and brocht him befor ther vncle the kyng Amulyus,
as thocht he wald accus him of a dedly cryme. And quhen thai war in
presens cumin, thai bayth attanys rays apon Amulyus and slew him, and
ther declaryt ther blud and genealogy; and therefter brocht haim thar
grandsyr Numytor, and restoryt to him his realm: syn went ther way,
and for thaim selvyn biggit Roym and wallyt fyrst. And, for thai war
bayth of a byrth, thai beguyth debait for the naim of the cyte. Than
was appunctyt that on the morn quha saw the mast nobyll syng, or takin
Augurian, suld geif the cyte his naym: and Remus fyrst saw vj gripis,
and Romulus eftyr hym xij gripis. Than said the tayn his takyn was
mast nobyll, for that he saw thaim first; and the tother na, becaus he
saw ma: bot quhiddir it was for that debait, or for the goyng our the
wallis, as otheris will say, Remus was slayn be Fabyus, chyftan of weyr
to Romulus, and the cyte clepit Roma eftyr Romulus. And quhou or quhy
that he is callit Quyrites, and of his dowtsum end, and of the sonnis
eclips the tym of his ded, and quhy he was repute a god, reid Titus
Lyuius, John Bocas in the last c. of the Genealogie of Godis, in the
ix. buke, and Augustyn in the Cyte of God, in the xv. c. of the iij.
buke. And sum thing heireftir in the xiij. c. of the vj. buke and the
x. c. of the viij. buyk.

_P. 39. l. 15._--Sanct Augustyn in his volum clepit _De verbis Domini_,
in the xxix sermond, mokkis at this word, sayand, Yit is not the end,
and the empyr is translat to the Almanys: bot Virgill was crafty, sais
he, that wald not on his awyn byhalf rehers thir wordis, bot maid
Jupiter pronunce thaim; and as he is a half fenzeit god, swa is his
prophecy.

_P. 39. l. 26._--Pthyia was the cuntre of Achylles; Myce, or Mycene,
the realm of Agamemnon; Arge the realm of kyng Adrastus, pertenyng
eftir to Diomed be raison of his moder; and it is oft tane for all
Grece, and the Grekis therfra bein oft clepit Argiui, or pepill of Arge.

_P. 40. l. 2._--Of Julius Cesar, quhen I behald his Commentareis, and
the gret volum of Lucan, and quhat of hym writis Swytoneus, I thynk
bettyr hald styll my pen than wryt lytill of sa large a mater, and
sa excellent a prynce. Bot ye sall knaw that the principall entent
of Virgill was to extoll the Romanys, and in specyal the famyllye or
clan Julyan, that comin from this Ascanyus, son to Eneas and Crevsa,
otherwais callyt Julus; becaus the empryour August Octauyan, quhamto he
direkkit this wark, was of that hows and blud, and sistyr son to Cesar
Julyus. And therfor, quhen Cesar was slayn by the Sanatouris, Octavyan
had revengeit his deth, and rang passabilly at the byrth of our
salviour, quhen the starn of Bethliam apperit. Than, to ples Octavian,
said the Romanys, that was the sawll of Cesar quhilk was deifyit; and
this opynion heir twichis Virgill, and als in his Bucolyqueys.

_P. 40. l. 13._--Off the stek and of closyng of the tempill of Janus
in tym of weyr and of pace, ye haf in the vij. buyk, in the x. c. And
this tempill of Janus was twys closit befor Octauian; anys be Numa
Pompilius, and the secund tym be Tytus Manlyus; and thris be Octavyan:
and this tym heyr markyt was the last tyme, at the cumyng of Cryst,
quhen all the warld was in pace. In wytnes therof the angellis sang
pace in erd, the tym of bryth; the ij. c. of Sanct Luke.

_P. 40. l. 22._--Off Mercury red in the v. c. of the iiij. buke: and
that Mercur heir was send doun from Jupiter is nocht ellis bot the
planet Mercur was at disces, and Jove ascendent; quhilk signifeit
frendschip in hast to cum, bot not to lest lang.

_P. 41. c. VI._--In this cheptir ye haf that Eneas met his moder Venus
in liknes of a virgyn, or a mayd; by the quhilk ye sall vndirstand that
Venus is fenyeit to be modyr to Eneas, becaus that Venus was in the
ascendent, and had domynation in the hevyn, the tym of his natyvite:
and, for that the planet Venus was the signifiar of his byrth, and had
domination and speciall influens towart hym, therfor is scho fenzeit
to be his mother; and thus it that poetis fenzeis bein full of secreyt
ondyrstandyng ondyr a hyd sentens or fygur. And weyn nocht for this,
thocht poetis fenzeis Venus the planet, for the caus foirsaid, to be
Eneas mother, at thai beleve nocht he was motherles, bot that he had
a fayr lady to his moder, quhilk for hir bewte was clepit Venus: and
that Venus metis Eneas in form and lyknes of a maid is to be onderstood
that Venus the planete that tym was in the syng of the Virgyn, quhilk
betakynnyt luf and fawouris of wemen. And of Venus and hir son Cupyd I
sall say sum thyng in the x. c. of this sam buke.

_P. 41. l. 20._--Mony expondis Achates for thochtfull cuyr or
solicitud, quhilk all tymys is feyr and companyeon to princis and gret
men.

_P. 42. l. 1._--The madynnis of Sparta bene the Amasonys.

_P. 42. l. 2._--Harpalica douchter to Ligurgus kyng of Trace, hir
fader beand tane be the pepil of Getya, assemblit hir power, and with
sa gret haist persewit thame, that scho semyt in swiftnes to forryn
the swiftast flude of Trace, callit Hebrun; and, with mair agilite and
hardyment than is almaste to be belevit, reskewit hir fader and ourcome
hir aduersaris.

_P. 43. l. 5._--Thus said scho for to dissimyll hyr self, or than
becaus that in Cypir was scho wirscheppit only wyth insens and flouris,
and nayn other sacrifyce, sa that it was onlefull ony blud war sched in
hir tempyll.

_P. 43. l. 12._--Of Agenor ye sal knaw that Jupiter engendrit Ephaphus,
quhilk gat Belus the first, that engendrit this Agenor, and he begat
Phenix, fra quham the realm of Tyre was namyt Phenycia, and the pepil
bath of Tyre and Cartage Phenycianys, or Punycianys. This Phenix begat
Belus the secund, otherwys callit Methres, and he was fader to this
Pygmaleon, and queyn Dido, otherwys nemmyt Elissa. This ilk Phenix
also engendrit Philistenes, quhilk begat this Sycheus, otherwys callit
Sicarbas, spous to this ilk Dido, and gret preste to Hercules.

_P. 44. l. 30._--Sum sais scho gave als mekyll gold as wald gang in a

for, in the langage of Affrik, _byrsa_ betakynnys leddyr, or a hyd: bot
Seruyus is of Virgillis opynion, sayand, Dido maid carve the bull hid
in sa small twhangis that it cumpassyt abowt the spas of xxij stageis,
that is thre myllis quarter les.

_P. 45. l. 17._--That Eneas heyr commendis his self, it is not to be
tayn that he said this for arrogans, bot for to schaw his scyll; as a
kyng or prince onknawin in an onkowth land, may, but repreif, rehers
his estate and dygnite, to mak him be tretyt as afferis. And als,
becaus he trastyt he spak with a goddes, that scho suld nocht aschaym
to remayn and talk with hym therfor: and becaus scho was a woman, he
schew that he was a man of autorite, with quham thai nedis nocht ascham
to speyk; for he was that man quhilk, by the common voce, was clepit
Eneas full of pyete. And for that Virgill clepis hym swa all thro
this buyk, and I interpret that term, quhylys, for _rewth_, quhils,
for _devotion_, and quhilis, for _pyete_ and _compassion;_ tharfor ye
sall knaw that pyete is a vertu, or gud deid, be the quhilk we geif
our dylligent and detfull lawbour to our natyve cuntre, and onto thaim

and liberalyte.

_P. 45. l. 24._--Varo sais that Eneas, fra his departing of Troy quhil

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

[Illustration: =A= THE AMIABLE]




A the Amiable!


[Illustration]

=A=h! what an +a+miable party is =A=,
He holds out his hand in a genial way;

He is hearty and hale,
And he loves a good sail.
What a capital friend on a fine summer’s day!

[Illustration: =B= THE BUMPTIOUS]




B the Bumptious.


[Illustration]

=B=oastful, and +b+umptious Bohemian =B=,
He plays on the fiddle most beautifully;

But is really so vain,
That some people complain
That his fiddling is nothing but fiddle-de-dee.

[Illustration: =C= THE CONTENTED]




C the Contented.


[Illustration]

=C=heerful, +c+ontented, and smiling is =C=,
A good-natured, pleasant old lady is she;

And even her cat,
Tho’ he isn’t too fat,
Appears to be grinning most amiably.

[Illustration: =D= THE DOLEFUL]




D the Doleful.


[Illustration]

=D=ear! Dear! What a +d+readfully +d+olorous =D=,
The picture of misery surely is he;

When he asks for a penny,
And doesn’t get any,
His language is not what his language should be.

[Illustration: =E= THE ENERGETIC]




E the Energetic.

[Illustration]


Behold, +e+nergetic and eager-eyed =E=,
Who has no time to stand upon ceremony;

He’s all hurry and hustle,
And scurry and bustle,
About something or other continually.

[Illustration: =F= THE FEEBLE]




F the Feeble.

[Illustration]


=F=idgety, +f+retful, and +f+ractious is =F=.
For feeble and fragile, and frail is old F;

Not a tooth in his head,
And now, it is said,
The old fellow’s becoming remarkably deaf.

[Illustration: =G= THE GENEROUS]




G the Generous.

[Illustration]


This is +g+ood-natured and +g+enerous =G=.
A kind little fellow, you’ll doubtless agree;

See him willingly share
That extremely large pear,
How very surprised Pretty Polly must be.

[Illustration: =H= THE HAUGHTY]




H the Haughty.

[Illustration]


=H=oity-toity! Here’s +h+igh-minded +h+aughty Miss =H=.
To be so self-satisfied’s naughty, Miss H,

With your nose in the air,
And your insolent stare,
I can’t think what you’ll look like at forty, Miss H.

[Illustration: =I= THE INDUSTRIOUS]




I the Industrious.


[Illustration]

You can’t help but admire this +i+ndustrious =I=,
Who is studying hard, tho’ there’s nobody by.

He’s so lost in his book,
He has no time to look
At the ink he has spilt; and it’s getting quite dry.

[Illustration: =J= THE JOLLY]




J the Jolly.


[Illustration]

This is the +j+ovial, +j+ocular =J=,
Who’s enjoying at Margate a fine holiday.

He makes everyone laugh,
With his fun and his chaff.
You’ve met somebody like him before, I dare say.

[Illustration: =K= THE KNAVISH]




K the Knavish.


[Illustration]

I’d +k+nock o’er the +k+nuckles this +k+navish young =K=:
He’s been picking a pocket and now runs away.

But Policeman X+2+
Has this person in view,
And will certainly catch the young rascal some day.

[Illustration: =L= THE LIVELY]




L the Lively.


[Illustration]

=L=issome and +l+ively is +l+ight-footed =L=,
Who dances the sailor’s hornpipe very well.

From morning to night,
He is merry and bright,
Is this jolly Jack Tar, one may easily tell.

[Illustration: =M= THE MEEK]




M the Meek.


[Illustration]

Down-trodden, brow-beaten, +m+eek little =M=,
This torrent of fault-finding nothing can stem.

If her mistress were kinder,
No doubt she would find her
The best of good servants, a regular gem.




N the Neighbourly.


[Illustration]

This is good-natured and +n+eighbourly =N=,
Who over the wall has been talking since ten.

To the lady next door,
(Who’s perhaps rather poor)
She’s lending her very best flat-iron again.

[Illustration: =N= THE NEIGHBOURLY]




O the Obliging.


[Illustration]

An +o+bliging +o+fficial is good P’liceman =O=.
He holds up his hand, and the coachman says “Whoa!”

His smile is seraphic,
When stopping the traffic,
To let a small lady cross over, you know.

[Illustration: =O= THE OBLIGING]




P the Perky.


[Illustration]

=P=erky and +p+roud is +p+articular =P=.
She wouldn’t converse with a policeman, not she!

But I have heard it said,
That a soldier in red
By her is regarded more favourably.

[Illustration: =P= THE PERKY]




Q the Quarrelsome.


[Illustration]

This is the +q+uerulous, +q+uarrelsome =Q=.
Nothing will please her, whatever you do;

And from morning till night,
This or that isn’t right,
And whatever you tell her, she says isn’t true.

[Illustration: =Q= THE QUARRELSOME]




R the Respectable.


[Illustration]

Proper and highly +r+espectable =R=.
About your appearance most particular.

The man with the broom
Steps aside to make room,
And wonders, poor fellow, whoever you are.

[Illustration: =R= THE RESPECTABLE]




S the Satisfied.


[Illustration]

In his cooking most highly +s+uccessful is =S=,
And his smiling face doth satisfaction express.

He says, “Very good stew!”
And so, doubtless, would you.
This person’s a Chef, as you see by his dress.

[Illustration: =S= THE SATISFIED]




T the Timid.


[Illustration]

=T=erribly +t+imid is +t+remulous =T=,
Who appears to be sitting uncomfortably.

He looks nervous and ill,
And will certainly spill
All his tea. He has spilt some already, I see.

[Illustration: =T= THE TIMID]




U the Unhappy.


[Illustration]

=U=nfortunate and most +u+nwilling is =U=.
The poor little chap’s in a terrible stew,

When he’s had the tooth out
He’ll be better, no doubt,
And a new tooth will grow where the other one grew.

[Illustration: =U= THE UNHAPPY]




V the Vacant.


[Illustration]

Utterly +v+acant and lost is poor =V=,
He’s forgotten the date of the wedding you see.

He’s forgotten the ring,
And in fact everything;
A remarkable kind of a bridegroom is he.

[Illustration: =V= THE VACANT]




W the Willing.


[Illustration]

Perfectly +w+illing is antique Miss =W=,
Tho’ I fear very much that nobody will trouble you.

Few are anxious to kiss
Such an elderly miss;
It is sad, but a fact, you poor ancient Miss W.

[Illustration: =W= THE WILLING]




X the Excitable.


[Illustration]

This is the highly excitable =X=.
The result of the poll, or some land we annex,

Drives him quite off his head;
And I have heard it said
That such conduct his wife doth exceedingly vex.

[Illustration: =X= THE EXCITABLE]




Y the Youthful.


[Illustration]

This is the girlish and +y+outhful Miss =Y=,
Who’ll bestow a sweet smile as she passes you by.

To look younger than ever
Is her constant endeavour;
Though her age you will probably guess, if you try.

[Illustration: =Y= THE YOUTHFUL]




Z the Zealous Zoologist.


[Illustration]

This is the +z+ealous +z+oologist =Z=
Examining an hippopotamus’ head.

There’s no cause for alarm,
It can do you no harm,
For the creature, of course, is decidedly dead.

[Illustration: =Z= THE ZEALOUS ZOOLOGIST]

be renamed.

law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

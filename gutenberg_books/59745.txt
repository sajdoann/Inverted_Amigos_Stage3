[Sidenote: Description of the Ocean.]

The Sea, that takes several Denominations from the Countreys which it
washeth, and surrounding the dry Land, cuts out, and shapes so many
winding Bays, Creeks, and Meandring Inlets, seems no where so much
confin’d and penn’d into so narrow a Channel, as the _Straights_ of
_Magellan_: From whence again, soon expatiating, it spreads it self into
two immense, and almost boundless Oceans, that which opens to the North,
gives terminaries to the four Regions of the Earth; that to the South,
onely to _Asia_ and _America_; both which, indeed, are but one continu’d
Sea, extending it self round the Universal Globe.

This watry part of the World, that almost through all Ages lay Fallow,
hath in these later times been Furrow’d by several Expert and Stout
Captains, who now by their Art and Industry, have given a good Account
of, and made clear Discoveries from East to West, where-ever the Sun
rises or sets.

The Northern Bounds under the _Artick-Zone_, have been hitherto so
obstructed with Ice, that the undertakings of such as adventur’d either
to find by the North-East or North-West a Passage to _India_, have been
utterly frustrate. Of the Southern, no such pains hath as yet been taken
in the Discovery, so that for the most part it is yet unknown how far
the Water, either deep or shallow, overspreads the Earth, onely thus
much Experience hath made out, that the _Antartick_ needs lesser Line to
Fathom, than the _Artick-Ocean_.

[Sidenote: The Ancients had little knowledge in Navigation.]

The antient _Greeks_, _Phenicians_, and _Romans_, or whosoever that were
Renown’d by Antiquity, and Listed in the number of their famous
Navigators, were no less Timerous than Ignorant concerning Maritim
Affairs, and are not fit to stand in the least degree of competition
with our later Voyagers.

[Sidenote: Navigation is very ancient.]

Of old, by an inviolable Law, made by Custom, according to _Pliny_,
_Vigetius_ and others, the Sea was lock’d up, from the eleventh of
_October_, to the tenth of _March_, no Ships daring to venture forth,
dreading short Nights, and foul Weather; neither in Summer, did they so
much as once offer, unless driven by Storms, to attempt the _Offin_, or
loose sight of Land; yet there is no question, but that several Nations
in former Ages, made it their business, spending their whole time, and
wearying themselves in the Practical Art of Navigation.

[Sidenote: Of _Eudoxus_, _Strab._ l. 2.]

The Sacred Scripture testifies, That the Kings of _Judea_, _Solomon_,
_Jehosaphat_, _Ozias_, and others, prepar’d several Fleets that Sail’d
through remote Seas, freighting themselves with Gold from _Ophir_, and
other Rarities, which were Imported to supply and enrich the
_Holy-Land_. And _Strabo_ also tells us, That King _Solomon_ being
contemporary with _Homer_, then discover’d _India_. And _Pliny_ relates,
That the _Romans_, in the Reign of _Augustus_, passing the _Straights_
of _Gibraltar_, and sleighting the _Ne plus ultra_, Coasted _Spain_,
_France_, and _Belgium_, leaving not at the Promontory of the
_Cimbrians_ (now call’d _Shager-Riff_) but also ventur’d into the
Northern Ocean, which washes _Norwey_ and _Lapland_: But long before
this, as _Athenæus_ relates, _Phileas Taurominites_, a _Grecian_
Captain, and several others pass’d the _Herculean-Pillars_, penetrating
the Northern Seas as far as _Britain_, and adventuring, made the first
Discovery of _Thule_: And to the Southward the _African_ Coasts without
_Gibraltar_, and beyond _Atlas_, were now and then explor’d by several
expert Captains. But more remarkable is the Voyage of _Hanno_ a
_Carthaginian_, who out-sail’d these, and inspected the Coasts of
_Africa_, as far as the _Gorgades_: And _Eudoxus Cyzicenus_, flying from
King _Lathyrus_, set Sail from the _Arabian_ Gulph, and passing the
_Great-Cape_, came to an Anchor at last in the Mouth of _Gibraltar_,
having discover’d all the Eastern, Southern, and Western parts of
_Africa_.

[Sidenote: Strange Voyage of some _Indians_.]

[Sidenote: Of _Menelaus_.]

Moreover, it deserves special observation, That an antient _Swedish_
King, as _Cornelius Nepos_ relates, sent as a Rarity and great Present
to the _Roman_ Consul _Metellus Celer_, some _Indians_, who loosing
their course, hatter’d up and down with perpetual Storms and stress of
Weather, were at last driven into the Northern Ocean, where they
suffer’d Shipwrack; yet saving themselves, Landed on his Coast:
_Aristonicus Gramaticus_ relates, That _Menelaus_ Sailing from the
_Sack_ of _Troy_, became so great a Voyager, that leaving the
_Straights_, he surrounded _Africa_, and discovering _India_, after
eight years re-measuring the same way he went, return’d with great
Riches in safety to his own Kingdom: Which is consentaneous to _Homer_,
who saith, _Odyss._ l. 4.

           ——_None must compare
         Mansions with_ Jove, _his Seats Celestial are:
         But with me any may, who eight years tost

         ’Mongst unknown Seas, of my Return small hope_,
         Cyprus, Phœnicia, Ægypt,[1] Æthiope,
         Sidon, Erembos _found, and_ Lybia, _where
         Their Lambs are horn’d, their Ews teem thrice a year._

           ——Ἤτοι ζηνὶ βροτῶν οὐκ ἄντις ἐρίζοι.
         Ἀθάνατοι γὰρ τοῦ γε δόμοι καὶ κτήματ ἔασιν.
         Ἀνδρῶν δ’ ἤκεν τίς μοί ἐρίζεται ἠὲ, καὶ οὐκὶ

Footnote 1:

  The Commentators on _Homer_ have been very inquisitive to find out
  _Menelaus_ Voyage into _Æthiopia_. _Crates_ suppos’d that he pass’d
  out at the _Straights_, doubled the Southern _Cape_, and so arriv’d
  thither. _Eratosthenes_ conjectures, that in the time of _Homer_ the
  _Straights_ Mouth was an Isthmus, and the _Ægyptian_ Isthmus
  overflow’d by the Sea, which afforded him a shorter passage. But that
  is most probable which _Strabo_ delivers, that he then went to the
  borders of _Æthiopia_, when he pass’d up _Ægypt_ to the City of
  _Thebes_; the Borders of _Æthiopia_ being not far distant from thence
  in _Strabo_’s time, probably very near it in _Homer_’s.

[Sidenote: Remarkable Voyage of an _Indian_ into _Egypt_,]

[Sidenote: Of _Ptolemy_]

[Sidenote: And also of _Cleopatra_.]

That which the _Grecian_ Geographers relate concerning _Ptolomy
Euergetes_, King of _Egypt_, is not to be forgotten, That sending
Pilots, Commission’d to take the Soundings, and settle the Land-marks in
the _Arabian_ Gulph, they found by chance a forsaken Vessel, onely in it
one Man half dead, lying among several other breathless Bodies, of whom,
being refresh’d with convenient Cordials, they enquir’d his Fortune, but
he being unable to give them any present satisfaction, neither
understanding what the other said, they sent him to the Court, where
soon having got a smattering of Greek, he inform’d _Euergetes_, that he
was a Native _Indian_, driven from their course into the place where
they found him by stress of Weather, and that his company were famish’d,
all their Provision spent in their Wandrings from their intended Voyage;
Thus being kindly entertain’d, he also promis’d the King to open his
Passage (if so he pleas’d) into _India_. The King slept not upon this
Intelligence, but immediately prepar’d a Fleet Freighted with such
Commodities as were advis’d; with which setting forth by the Conduct of
this their _Indian_ Pilot, they Anchor’d in their desir’d Port, and
brought the King in return from thence a rich _Cargo_ of Silk, Spices,
costly Drugs, and precious Gems. _Cleopatra_, about sixty years after,
intending not to lose the advantages reap’d by the former discoveries,
equipp’d another and greater Navy; which passing through the Red-Sea,
found the Stern of a Ship, on which was Presented a Horse, whereby some
of the more knowing Sea-men judg’d, that it had been a _Gibraltar_
Vessel, and Sailing about _Africa_, there by sad accident suffer’d a
Wrack. This Stern was afterwards set up, and fix’d as a Memorial in the
Market-place of _Memphis_.

[Sidenote: The _Venetians_ were the first that drove a trade from
           _Europe_ to the _East-Indies_.]

[Sidenote: How they went their journeys.]

In these later times, the first that endeavor’d to drive an _European_
Trade in _Africk_, and held Commerce with _India_, was the State of
_Venice_, who Sail’d from thence through the _Adriatick_, into the
_Mediterranean-Sea_: So Steering for _Alexandria_, where unlading their
Goods, from thence they carry’d them over Land, and Shipping again in
the _Arabian_ Gulph, Sail’d directly for _India_. Thus by Land and
Water, were exchang’d several Commodities, and the _Indian_ Growth and
rich Products of the Oriental World plentifully Transported to _Venice_,
and from thence, all _Europe_ had ample Accommodation, until an
_Egyptian Sultan_ suffer’d the Way to be infested by Thieves and
Murdering Robbers, that so they were enforc’d to remove thence, and
Discharge their several Cargoes at _Aleppo_; from whence, on Mules and
Camels, they carry’d their Goods to _Babylon_, so to _Balsarum_, and
then to _Ormus_, where they Re-ship’d thence, directly standing for
_India_.

Thus they enjoy’d the benefit of so great a Trade and Commerce, until
the _Portuguese_ found a Passage by Sea, saving the Expence and trouble
of carrying Goods so far by Land to _India_; Of which here we will a
little inlarge.

[Sidenote: By what means the _Portuguese_ came first to discover the
           Coasts of _Africa_ and _India_.]

[Sidenote: Why _Africa_ was no further discover’d.]

_John_, the first King of _Portugal_, who took from the _Moors_, by
force of Arms, _Septa_, an _African_ City, having five Sons; _Henry_ his
fourth behav’d himself so gallantly in the Leaguer of _Septa_, that
after he became Master of the place, this Prince made many bold
Excursions in several Parties against the Enemy, bringing in daily great
store of Booty; so growing rich, he Rigg’d out two new Vessels to make
farther Discoveries along the Coast of _Africa_. Yet this his Expedition
went on but slowly, being much taken off in Building there a new City,
then call’d _Tarzanabala_, and since _Villa Infantis_; but being
Admonish’d by a Dream, and Check’d for his laying thus aside his first
Design of Navigation; he soon after, _Anno 1410._ set forth the Ships
that he intended, which he the more accelerated, being inform’d by some
of his Prisoners Natives, that _Africa_ spread from the Basis of
_Mount-Atlas_, very far towards the South: This Mountain then was the
Terminary of Navigation that way, because thereabouts a long Ridge or
Shelf of Sands thrust its Point under Shallow Waters so far out into the
Ocean, that none durst venture to Sail into the _Offin_, being out of
sight of Land to double this conceal’d _Cape_.

[Sidenote: Who first ventur’d into the _Offin_.]

[Sidenote: _Madera_’s, by whom peopled.]

The first that attempted to find Deep Water, and get round about,
discovering several unknown Coasts, and Uninhabited Isles belonging to
that Region, were _Joannes Gonsalves_, _Tristan Varseus_, and _Ægidius
Annius_; amongst which were the _Madera_’s, and _St. George de Picho_,
which Prince _Henry_ first Planted with _Portuguese_, and others since
with _Netherlanders_. He also obtain’d a Grant from Pope _Martin_ the
Fifth, of all the discover’d Territories East-ward from the _Canaries_,
for ever to be the undoubted Right, and belonging to the Crown of
_Portugal_.

[Sidenote: By whom _Genny_ was discover’d.]

Discoveries of new Countreys, lay neglected, because King _Alphonso_
turmoyl’d in a Civil War, his Crown being at stake, had not leisure to
think or look after uncertain improvements by Sea; yet at last having
quell’d his Enemies, he ventur’d forth some Ships, who Sail’d as far as
the River _Zenaga_, and came to Anchor before the City of _Genny_,
famous since for Trade, which gave its denomination to the Countrey and
Coasts of _Guiny_, where they dealing, Barter’d for Ivory, Gold, Slaves,
and also got so much footing into the Countrey, that they suddenly
rais’d up a Fort, and Man’d it with a strong Garrison, Shipping their
Slaves for _Lisbon_.

_John_ the Second succeeding his Father _Alphonso_, had a great design
upon _Arabia_ and _India_, and if possible, was ambitious to open a
Passage from the _Atlantick_, to the _Oriental-Seas_. But the difficulty
lay in Steering so often from sight of Land, venturing into the Main
Ocean, obstructed by so many dangerous Shoals that lay so far out into
the _Offin_.

[Sidenote: For the Northern Constellations the _Astrolabe_ was in use
           long before.]

At that time flourish’d three famous Mathematicians, _Rhoderick_,
_Joseph_, and _Martin Bohemus_, Pupils bred up by _Joannes Monteregius_;
with which the King consulting, perswaded, that they would by their Art
invent some Instrument, that by Southern Constellations, the Pole being
depress’d, the Navigator might know where he was, and in what height; so
guessing what distance they were from this or that Countrey; they
accordingly Club’d Learning, and by their great Study, found out what
since hath prov’d so useful and beneficial to Seamen, the _Astrolabe_;
which help having obtain’d, the Sailers encourag’d, more frequently
ventur’d into remote and unknown Seas.

[Sidenote: Remarkable passage of _Jaques Cano_.]

[Sidenote: Discovery of _Congo_.]

[Sidenote: _John_ the Second, seeks to discover _India_ by water.]

After these, King _John_ of _Portugal_ sent _Jaques Cano_ with a Fleet,
who Sailing, found the River _Zaires_, where he erected a Pillar with an
Inscription, _Latin_ and _Portuguese_, signifying by whom, and in what
Kings Reign these _African_ Coasts were discover’d: Here he also met
some of the Natives, who more civiliz’d than the rest, told him, That
they had a mighty King, who Raigning over them, kept his Court some few
days Journey up in the Countrey, to whom _Cano_ sending his Agents,
detain’d four _Africans_ as Pledges, which he carry’d with their free
consent to _Portugal_, promising to bring them back in fifteen Months,
who before that time having got some smatterings of their Tongue,
inform’d them, that their Native Soyl was call’d _Congo_, whither
returning by the appointed time, they were according to their agreement,
exchang’d for the _Portuguese_, and _Cano_ address’d himself with rich
Presents to their King, whom he found sitting in their manner on an
Ivory Throne, being from the middle upward Naked, his nether parts
cover’d with long Silken Skirts, a Golden Armlet on his left Arm,
athwart his Shoulders hung a Horses Tail, their Badge of Royal Dignity:
_Cano_ humbly laid the Presents down at the Kings feet, amongst which
was a Gilded Flag, or Pennon with a Cross, which Pope _Innocent_ the
Eighth had Consecrated with great Ceremony. After this, many of that
Nation became Christians, and the King himself receiv’d Baptism. But in
short time, by the Instigations of their Diabolical Priests, and others,
Christianity loosing ground, grew out of countenance: Mean while, King
_John_ the Second vigorously Prosecuted the business of Discovery,
sending _Jews_ and _Christians_ by Land from _Alexandria_ and other
parts of _Egypt_ to _India_, and from thence to explore the Coasts on
the Eastern side of _Africa_, to the _Great-Cape_; if so a way might be
found fit for Navigators, having doubled that Point, to Traffick with
the Oriental parts of the World.

[Sidenote: _Vasques de Gama_, his expedition.]

After this Princes Death the Work lay sill a while, but in short time,
King _Emanuel_ his Successor freshly undertook the business once more,
sending _Vasques de Gama_ with four Ships, who passing through many
Dangers with great Difficulties, Anchor’d at last before _Calecut_, and
was the first of the _Europeans_ that found a way to the _East-Indies_.

[Sidenote: _Christopher Columbus_’s.]

[Sidenote: Dividing of the earth.]

But _Christopher Columbus_, five Years before _Gama_’s Expedition to the
East, had been employ’d in Western Discoveries, which prov’d so very
successful, that he found no less than another World; which soon after,
from _Americus Vesputius_, was call’d _America_: So that the Division of
the World by the Antients, (concerning which they had so long err’d, and
were utterly mistaken) was now made manifest by Experience, and
undisputable Demonstration; for formerly the whole World was known by no
other names than _Asia_, _Africa_, and _Europe_, but now, those three
are found to make but one Part of what incircles the Universal Globe;
because in the South lies a second, known no further than by its
Coastings and Superficial Margents; the third part being the New-World,
our _America_.

[Sidenote: A query, if _America_ was known to the Ancients.]

[Sidenote: _Atlantica. Plato in Crisis & Timæo._]

Here it will not seem amiss, having prov’d that _Africa_ was more than
Coasted by the Ancients, to ingage and search with some scrutiny
concerning this _America_; First, Whether at any time ’twas known by the
Ancients? And next, by what People, and when first Inhabited? About the
former, the Learned of these later times Jangle amongst themselves, for
some of them will needs ascribe so much Honor to Antiquity, declining
the Worthy Praise of those that made so wonderful a Discovery, as if
they of old, and many Ages before, had done the same, or at least, that
this New-World to them was not unknown, maintaining this their bold
Assertion from the Authority of what they find, both in Ancient _Greek_,
and _Latin_ Authors: First, especially in the Learned _Plato_, who, as
you know at large, describes a New _Atlantis_, lying beyond the
_Straights_ of _Gibraltar_; whose Coast is surrounded with two vast Seas
that are Sow’d thick with scatter’d Islands. By these Seas they
understand the Atlantick and Southern-Sea, by the many Isles, _Cuba_,
_Hispaniola_, _Jamaica_, _California_, and others, which lie sprinkled
along the Coasts of _America_. But it cannot be made out, that _Plato_
describes ought but a Fancy, his own _Idea_, not a Countrey that ever
was, is, or shall be, though he sets it forth so Accurately, and with
such Judgment, as if he had taken a Survey of the place, and found such
a Land indeed.

[Sidenote: _Diod. Sic._ lib. 6.]

[Sidenote: _Arist. de Mirandis in Natura auditis._]

In like manner, _Diodorus Siculus_ undertakes to prove, That _America_
was known to the Antients; telling a Story, how the _Phenicians_ were
driven by a Storm from the Coasts of _Africa_ West-ward, falling at last
upon a great and altogether unknown Island, which our late Expositors
take for _America_; Must it therefore be so? Surely not, for it is onely
a bare Story, without any Proof or the least Testimony. They endeavor to
make _Aristotle_ bolster up their opinion that he had a knowledge of
this New-World, which with no small pains they pump from these Words:
“Beyond the _Herculean_ Pillars, certain _Carthaginian_ Merchants
penetrated the Atlantick Ocean so far, that at last they found a vast,
yet un-inhabited Island, producing nothing but Herbage, Plants, and
Wild-Beasts, yet interlac’d with many Meandring Rivers, abounding with
several sorts of Fish, lying some days Sail from the Continent; they
Landing, found a Soyl so fertile, and Air so temperate, that there they
setled, and were the first Planters of that Isle. But the
_Carthaginians_ having intelligence thereof, Prohibited all Persons
whatsoever, upon Pain of Death, to go thither, fearing the place being
so much commended, all the People would be ready to flock thither, and
desert their own, and so utterly unfurnish and debilitate their then
growing Common-wealth.”

[Sidenote: _Æneid._ lib. 6.]

But how could the _Carthaginians_ find _America_, without the use of the
Compass? How happen’d it, that they were so taken with the fertility of
this their New-found-Land, when the Adjacent Countreys and Fields about
_Carthage_ are every where Flourishing, and most Luxurious? So that it
may better be suppos’d, that what _Aristotle_ found so long since, may
rather be the _Canary-Isles_, or _Great-Brittain_, than _America_. The
_Greeks_ having then also made some Inspection into the
_Brittish-Isles_. They would also make you believe, that _Virgil_ the
Prince of Latin Poets, had known the New-World in these Verses; _Æneid._
lib. 6.

          _There, there’s the Prince, oft promis’d us before,
          Divine_ Augustus Cæsar, _who once more
          Shall Golden Days bring to th’_ Ausonian _Land,
          Kingdoms that once old_ Saturn _did command,
          And shall His power to_ India _extend,
          Beyond the Annual Circle, and beyond
          The Sun’s long Progress, where great_ Atlas _bears,
          Laden with Golden Stars, the glittering Sphears;_

          Hic vir, hic est, tibi quem promitti sæpius audis,
          _Augustus Cæsar_, divûm genus, aurea condet
          Sæcula, qui rursus Latio, regnata per arva
          Saturno quondam, super & Garamantas & Indos
          Proferet imperium. Jacet extra sidera tellus,
          Extra anni Solisque vias, ubi cœlifer _Atlas_
          Axem humero torquet stellis ardentibus aptum.

[Sidenote: _America_ was not known to the Ancients.]

But what of all this? Who finds in any of these Writings, any Marks of
_America_, or the least Description thereof? Though we cannot deny that
the Antient Sages and Wise Philosophers of former times might easily
make out, and no question did, that the Earth and Sea made the perfect
Figure of a Globe; first from the round Shadow of the Earth that
Ecclipses the Moon; the different Risings and Settings of the Celestial
Luminaries; and the still Variation of the Pole; so that the Earth and
Sea making one Ball, they might easily conjecture, that the South-side
of the Equinoctial might be Inhabited as well as the North: But all this
was more grounded upon Natural Reason and Right Judgement, than any
Experience of theirs, or the least certain knowledge thereof, which
since these later times had the first happiness to obtain; so laying
these Conjectures aside, there have been none more grosly erroneous, and
so utterly mistaken in this Point, than some of the Ancients, and
especially the Fathers of the Church.

[Sidenote: _Lactant._ l. 3. c. 24.]

_Lactantius Firmianus_, and St. _Austin_, who strangely jear’d at as
ridiculous, and not thinking fit for a Serious Answer the Foolish
Opinion of _Antipodes_, or another Habitable World beyond the _Equator_:
At which, _Lactantius_ Drolling, says, _What, Forsooth, here is a fine
Opinion broach’d indeed; an_ Antipodes! _heigh-day! People whose Feet
tread with ours, and walk Foot to Foot with us; their Heads downwards,
and yet drop not into the Sky! There, yes, very likely, the Trees loaden
with Fruit grow downwards, and it Rains, Hails, and Snows upwards; the
Roofs and Spires of Cities, tops of Mountains, point at the Sky beneath
them, and the Rivers revers’d topsi-turvy, ready to flow into the Air
out of their Channels!_

[Sidenote: _Lactant._ error concerning our _Antipodes_.]

[Sidenote: As also St. _Austin. de Civit. Dei_ l. 16. c. 9.]

But these seeming witty Observations of _Lactantius_, though they may
serve for a Jest, yet are not grounded on any serious Reasons; for the
Earth and Sea being Globular, making one Universal Ball; all Materials
whatsoever that belong to this great Body, sink by a natural Propensity
towards its Center; so that where-ever we Travel, our Feet are
downwards, and our Heads upwards, the Sky above, and the Earth beneath;
neither need they fear, that any where the Earth should Moulder and drop
into the Clouds: But St. _Austin_ Reasons better, admitting that the
Earth and Sea make a Universal Globe; yet it no way follows, that
inhabited Countreys should lye opposite to our Northern, nay, altogether
impossible, seeing that side which is our _Antipodes_ is all nothing but
Sea; and should we allow, that there were Land and Water mixt as ours
is, who could prove, that they were Peopled? or how could any get
thither, over such Vast and Immense Seas? or possibly pass the extream
heat of the Torrid Zone, not to be endur’d by any living Creature? And
what then becomes of Sacred Scripture, which says positively, _That all
Men were deriv’d from_ Adam, _and after the Floud, from_ Noah _and his
three Sons_? Therefore the Nations of the _Antipodes_ must be of another
Abstract, there being no possibility (as they suppos’d) of passing from
this World to that: But since the Discovery of the _East_ and
_West-Indies_, Experience, the best Mistress, hath taught, that in the
South are mighty Lands and vast Territories, and that as far as they
have been Penetrated, are found to be full of People, extending their
Dominions from East to West. And though St. _Austin_ deny’d this now
well-known Truth, yet long before his time, _Cicero_, _Pliny_, and
others amongst the _Greeks_ and _Romans_, divided the Earth under five
_Zones_; which _Virgil_ describes thus:

          _Five Zones the heav’ns infold, hot Sun-beams beat
          Always on one, and burns with raging heat.
          The two Extreams to this on each hand lies
          Muffled with Storms, fetter’d with cruel Ice.
          ’Twixt Cold and Heat, two more there are, th’ aboads
          Assign’d poor Mortals by th’ Immortal Gods._

          Quinque tenent cælum zonæ: quarum una corusco
          Semper Sole rubens, & torrida semper ab igni:
          Quam circum extremæ dextra, lævaque trahuntur
          Cærulea glacie concretæ, atque imbribus atris.
          Has inter, mediamque, duæ mortalibus ægris
          Munere concessæ divum: via secta per ambas,
          Obliquus qua se signorum verteret ordo.

[Sidenote: _Macrob. in Somnio Scipionis._ l. 2. c. 5.]

[Sidenote: _Vide Carpent. Geograph._]

With _Virgil_, _Pliny_, and the Prince of Latin Orators agree, who
saith, “You see, that those that inhabit the Earth dwell in Countreys so
separated one from another, that it is impossible they should have any
Commerce; some of them are our _Antipodes_, walking with their Heads
downwards, some their Feet against our sides, others, as we, with their
Heads upright. You see how the same Earth seems to be Swath’d about with
Rolls, of which, two separated by the other three, are at utmost
distance one from the other, lying equi-distant under the Vertick Points
of Heaven, always cover’d with Snow and Ice; but the middlemost and
greatest is scorch’d by the violent heats of the Sun: Two Tracts are
Habitable, one to the South, our _Antipodes_, the other North, which we
Inhabit.”

[Sidenote: _Pliny_ lib. 2.]

And _Pliny_ also affirms, though against the Vulgar Opinion, this truth,
“That the Earth is round about inhabited, and that people walk Foot to
Foot in most parts thereof; though every one be ready to ask why our
_Antipodes_ drop not into the Sky; which question, our _Antipodes_ may
also ask concerning us.”

But although the Ancients upon these and the like Demonstrations well
understood, that there was a Habitable World towards the South under our
_Horizon_, yet they could not make out or believe, that there was any
possibility to pass thither; And, according as St. _Austin_ conceiv’d,
That the Earth produc’d nothing under either Pole, by reason of
excessive cold, and that the _Equinoxs_ or _Middle-Zone_, was not to be
penetrated, because of the insufferable heat.

[Sidenote: _Macrob. in Somno Scip._ lib. 2.]

And _Macrobius_ saith, “That the _Equinoctial_ Circle, the _Artick_ and
_Antartick Lines_, bind the two Habitable _Zones_, and make Temperate by
the excessive Neighboring Heats and Colds; and these Countreys onely
give Animation, and comfortable Enjoyment to all Living Creatures.”

Moreover, St. _Austin_ in some places seems to clear his own Doubts,
saying, “That People, if they could find a means to Sail those Vast and
Undiscover’d Seas, might make Land, raising new Stars under another
Sky.”

[Sidenote: How beasts came on remote Islands.]

A Learned Father, searching after the Original of all sorts of Beasts
which multiply by Generation, concludes, That they must derive
themselves from those that were sav’d with _Noah_ in the Ark. But how
came they to the Isles? To those adjacent and near the Main Land, they
might easily Swim; to the remoter, they were Transported.

[Sidenote: And chiefly the wild.]

[Sidenote: _Austin_ is contradicted.]

[Sidenote: How men came to new Countreys.]

But this Doubt is not altogether clear’d, for the Domestick and other
Creatures fit for Humane use and Sustenance were thus brought thither:
Yet how comes it to pass, that Voracious and Wild Creatures are also
found there, such as Wolves, Tigers, Lions, and other Beasts of Prey?
This puzzle putting St. _Austin_ to a stand, he had no other means to
get off, but by saying, that by God’s Commands or Permission, the Angels
convey’d them thither; If so, why might not God please to Plant Men
there in like manner, and the rather, the Earth being created for Humane
use? But what needed this, when Men can in Ships Transport themselves,
either of their own accord for curious Inquest, to find new Countreys,
or else enforc’d by stress of Weather, to far remoter, and altogether
unknown Lands: Besides, though the Earth is here and there divided by
large Bays and vast Seas, yet nevertheless, in other places it is all
continu’d Land, or at least parted by some narrow In-let or Sea; so that
there was no difficulty for a crouded Plantation to go over, and so ease
themselves in another Countrey, till then not Inhabited; therefore none
need to question, but that from _Adam_, or nearer, from _Noah_’s three
Sons, _Sem_, _Ham_, and _Japhet_, those, as well as we, were extracted,
that Inhabit this our other World.

[Sidenote: Reasons why _America_ was so long unknown.]

[Sidenote: Who first sail’d on the Ocean.]

[Sidenote: Several opinions of the Antients concerning it.]

[Sidenote: _Brittains_ amongst the first Inventors of Navigation.]

But one question is to be observ’d, How first after the expiration of so
many Ages in these our later times, a New-World was discover’d,
altogether unknown to the Antients, when they in the greatness of their
Parts and Undertaking, Prowess and Prudence, were no ways inferior to
the Modern, and every way as fit for great Designs and grand Exploits?
We need not scruple or make the least doubt, but the Sea hath been
Navigated of old; but the first attempters set forth unexperienc’d, in
as pittiful and ill-contriv’d Vessels. The _Heathens_ ascribe the Art of
Navigation, first to the _Cretans_, who under the Conduct of _Neptune_,
set forth a Navy to explore Foraign Countries. But _Pliny_ long before
gives the Invention of this Art to _Erythra_, King of _Egypt_, who upon
Pieces of Timber, conjoyn’d and brac’d together, crept along the Shores,
and ventur’d to Discover the Isles in the _Red-Sea_. But others give
that honor to the _Trojans_, and _Micians_, when with a Fleet by Sea,
they Invaded _Thrace_: Others, to the _Brittains_, who made little
Vessels of Leather, and were the first that by this Invention found how
to Float upon the Waters: Some plead, that the _Samothracians_ were
first; Others, that _Danæus_ before all, found a way by Sea from _Egypt_
to _Greece_. But without all Contradiction, _Noah_’s Ark was the Pattern
or Sample, that succeeding Ages imitating, built their Ships by; and the
more probable, because his Offspring multiplying so fast, that they were
enforc’d to inlarge their Colonies, by passing Seas, and other broad
Rivers, to settle their Super-numeraries there.

[Sidenote: The first Inventers of several things belonging to Shipping.]

So _Jason_ Invented a Ship, which he call’d _Argos_, which _Sesostris_
King of _Egypt_ took as his Pattern. Next, the _Biremis_, a Galley with
double Banks of Oars, was made by the _Erythreans_; with treble Banks,
by the _Corinthian Amocles_; the addition of the _Quadruple_, the
_Carthaginians_ boast; of the _Quinqueremis Nesichthon_, _Alexander the
Great_, brought them to twelve Banks; _Ptolomy Soter_, to fifteen;
_Demetrius_, _Antigonus_ Son, doubled them to thirty; _Ptolomy
Philadelphus_, to forty; and last of all, _Philopater_ rais’d them to
fifty Banks of Oars. _Hippus_ a _Tirian_, was the first that set Ships
upon the Stocks; the _Rhodians_ a Ketch, and the _Batavians_ a Boat; the
_Copes_ made the first Oar; _Dedalus_ the Mast and Boltsprit; _Piscus_
the Beak; the _Tyrrheans_ the Anchor; _Tiphys_ the Rudder; taking
example from the motion of a Kites Stern; _Icarus_ found Sails, fancy’d
by the Poets for Wings, though some ascribe that honor to his Father
_Dedalus_.

[Sidenote: Why in former Ages no remote Countreys were discover’d.]

_Minos_ was the first that Ingag’d in a Sea-Fight, whereby we may easily
conjecture, that of old none adventur’d far into the _Offin_, or to
remote Countreys, not daring to trust their so sleight contriv’d
Vessels. But these later times have strangely and suddenly improv’d this
growing Art of Navigation, yet pitch’d not to that height at first, as
boldly to adventure, and loose sight of Land.

[Sidenote: The manner of the Antients Sailing.]

[Sidenote: Of the _Romans_.]

[Sidenote: Why _America_ was so lately known.]

The _Tyrians_ first understood how to Steer their Course by the
North-Star, and when dark and foul Weather had Clouded the Sky, that
they could neither see Heaven or Earth, but onely Sea, they directed
their Course by the Wind; and if they doubted the change thereof, they
let some Birds flie, whom they follow’d, supposing that they stood
directly to the nearest Land. But these are but poor helps, and blind
Guides to shew you Land from the middle of the boundless Ocean. It is
certain, that the _Romans_ in the time of _Julius Cæsar_ and _Augustus_,
stretch’d the Bounds of that Empire Eastward to _Euphrates_, the
_Rhyne_, and the _Danube_, and Westward to the _Ocean_ and _Mount
Atlas_, Sailing up and down the _Mediterranean_, with great Fleets,
which stoutly endur’d the violence both of Waves and Weather; but all
this made them not so hardy, as once to think or look after new Worlds.
But after the _Roman_ power decreas’d, by several Eruptions of the
_Goths_, _Vandals_, _Huns_, _Normans_, _Lumbards_, and other Northern
Countreys, which swarm’d with People, that overflow’d all places like a
Deluge, so that _Europe_ was every where puzzel’d and Imbroyl’d, their
whole business consisting in conjoyning Forces to withstand such bold
Invaders, and so vexatious an Enemy.

And farther East, _Asia_ was at the same time little better, still
trembling at the daily Alarms and Incursions of the _Scythians_,
_Persians_, and _Saracens_; and afterwards the _Turks_ growing upon them
more than any of the former, expected no other than a sad Catastrophe,
so that the known World had too much work cut out for them by these
Distractions and Alterations of Government, then to go in Quest of
uncertainties, to find they know not where, another.

[Sidenote: _Hieron. in_ c. 2. _Ephes._]

Here also is added by St. _Jerom_, what an antient Writer saith, _Great
care hath been taken in Computing the Age of this World, and if there be
another which Commenc’d not with ours_, (as _Clemens_ mentions in his
Epistles) _where are scituate those Seas and Lands that make that second
World? Or is a part of that, in which_ Adam _was Created? Or may it not
rather Metaphorically be taken for Worldly Affairs, govern’d by the
Prince of the Air, ruling in the Hearts of the Children of
Disobedience?_

[Sidenote: The Antients opinion of an unknown world.]

But _Pliny_, _Cicero_, and _Virgil_, the best in their kind of Latin
Writers, concur, That there may be a habitable World under our
_Horizon_, in the temperate Southern _Zone_, beyond the extream heat,
and on this side of the _Antartick_ colds.

[Sidenote: _In Comment. super_ Obad. v. 19, 20, 21.]

[Sidenote: _And they of the south shall possess the mount of_ Elau, _and
           they of the plain, the_ Philistines: _and they shall possess
           the fields of_ Ephraim, _and the fields of_ Samaria, _and_
           Benjamin _shall possess_ Gilead. _And the captivity of this
           host of the children of_ Israel _shall possess that of the_
           Canaanites, _even unto_ Zarephath, _and the captivity of_
           Jerusalem, _which is in_ Sepharad, _shall possess the Cities
           of the south. And saviors shall come upon mount_ Zion, _to
           judge the mount of_ Esau, _and the kingdom shall be the
           LORDS_.]

But what signifies all this to the Discovery of _America_, which lies
not onely under the scorching Heats of the _Equinox_, but under the
Frosts and Snows of the _Artick_ and _Antartick-Poles_? Yet less
probable is that which _Lodowick Leo_, an _Augustine_ Frier takes out of
_Obadiah_; as if that Prophet in the three last Verses of his _Prophecy_
should speak of the _Spaniards_, which should not onely discover and
Conquer _America_, but also Convert the Inhabitants to the _Christian
Faith_, because those that are in _Sepharad_, should Inherit and Possess
the Cities of the South, _And Saviours shall arise from the Mountains
of_ Zion, _to judge the Mount and Wealth of_ Esau.

[Sidenote: If _America_ is known in the Scripture.]

But certainly, _Obadiah_ meant no other than the Restauration of the
_Jews_ from the Captivity of _Babylon_, who after their return, should
grow more powerful than ever, and they, led by their _Messias_, obtain
the height of all felicity, who would send his _Evangelists_ and
_Apostles_ to declare Salvation to the utmost Borders of the Earth. It
is true, that the _Rabins_ Expound _Sepharad_ to be _Spain_, and
therefore he concludes, that _Obadiah_ Prophesi’d of the _Spaniard_, and
their Conquests in _America_; so they would prove, that _America_ was
long known before Christ.

[Sidenote: _Solomon_’s Fleet sail’d not to _Peru_.]

And lastly, It signifies as little what _Pineda_ and _Levinus Lemnius_
drive at, That _Solomon_ first finding the use of the Compass, Rigg’d a
Navy at _Ezion-Geber_, which from the _Red-Sea_ had no indirect Course
to the _Straights_ of _Magellan_; from whence he might Lade his Vessels
with the Gold of _Peru_. In whose Description it shall be manifested,
that _Peru_ is not _Ophir_, as some without any shew of Reason or Truth
would make us believe.

[Sidenote: _Solomon_ did not find the Compass.]

But as concerning King _Solomon_’s finding out the use of the _Magnet_,
it is soon said, but not easily proved; for though that Prince exceeded
all Man-kind in Wisdom and Learning, and was perfect in the Operations,
and knew the Occultest Secrets of Nature, understanding what e’re
belong’d to Plants, from the Cedar of _Libanus_, to Hysop, and the
meanest Shrub that grows upon the Wall; yet it nothing makes out, that
he knew the Mystery of the Navigable use of the _Load-Stone_: But
suppose he did know, there is no where any mention of it; and if this
excellent thing, the _Compass_, had been found in _Solomon_’s time, how
came it afterwards so utterly to be lost?

_Albertus Magnus_ mistakes, when he ascribes the knowledge of the
_Compass_ to _Aristotle_, of which he himself makes not the least
mention; neither _Galen_, _Alexander Aphrodisiensis_, _Pliny_,
_Lucretius_, nor any of the _Roman_, _Greek_, _Arabian_, or other
Countrey Writers whatsoever. Some give the honor thereof to an _Indian_,
others to a Shepherd in _Mount Ida_, whose Clouted Shooes being full of
Hob-Nails, the Iron sticking fast to the Stones on which he stood, stopt
his motion. And although the Antients found out many Secrets of Nature,
amongst which this of the _Load-Stone_, Attracting Iron, as being its
proper Food; and the three sorts of the _Magnet_, of which some will not
draw Steel, found by _Theamedes_ a _Greek_ Author, and other since, well
known Properties: Yet they never attain’d that knowledge, that the
_Load-Stone_ would ease Pain, and stop the effusion of Blood, though the
edge piercing the Skin, open’d the Vein: as _Hieronimus Cardanus_
experienc’d on himself and others, which he had from _Laurentius
Guascus_, a great Chyrurgeon. Much less, that the Needle of the
_Compass_ being touch’d by the _Load-Stone_ on the Northside of the
_Equinox_, respects the North; but depressing the _Artick_, and raising
the _Antartick_ Pole, it looks as stedfastly towards the South: But far
less dreamt they of its several variations, according to the Coasts that
are nearest; as when you come from the Island _del Cuervo_, the Point
varies more West; but Sailing towards the _Equinox_, it varies Eastward;
by which we may absolutely conclude, that without this use of the
_Load-Stone_, first found by _Flavius Melvius_ a _Neapolitan_, in the
Year 1303. it was altogether impossible to reach _America_. So that
_Joseph de Acosta_ mistakes, who gives the honor of the finding so great
a benefit to Navigation, to some _Mahumetan_ Sea-men which _Vasques de
Gama_ met with near _Mosambique_, who had Sail’d those Seas by the use
thereof; whereas _Gama_’s Expedition was above a hundred years after
_Melfius_, who liv’d in such a juncture of time for Mathematical
Learning, that few Ages boasted the like: For then flourish’d in
_England_, and were Contemporaries, besides others abroad, _Richard
Wallingford_, _Nicolas de Lynna_, _John Halifax_, _Walter Britte_, _John
Duns_, and _John de Lignarys_, all eminent in Astronomical Arts,
belonging to Navigation, and doubtless, no small helps to _Melfius_ in
this his happy Invention.

Lastly, We will relate what hath been held as a seeming Testimony, (that
_America_ was known to the _Europeans_ before the Birth of our Saviour)
by an antique Meddal of the Emperor _Augustus_, digg’d out of the Ground
in _Peru_, and sent to his Holiness at _Rome_, which may well be
reckon’d with the like Cheat contriv’d by _Hermicus Cajadus_, _Anno
1505._ near _Syntra_, a Town in _Portugal_, where three Marbles Ingraven
with antient Characters, concerning a Prophecy of discovering the
_East-Indies_ by the _Portuguese_, in the Reign of King _Emanuel_, were
privately bury’d under Ground, and not long after, by a pretended
accident digg’d out, which made such a bustle amongst the Learned, that
several tired themselves about the explanation of the suppos’d Sibylline
Prediction.

                               CHAP. II.
 _Of the Original of the_ Americans, _whence they came, when, how, and
                       from what People Planted_.

[Sidenote: The original of the _Americans_ much disputed on.]

About the Original of the _Americans_, the Learned Dispute so much, that
they find nothing more difficult in Story, than to clear that Point; for
whether inquiry be made after the time, when the _Americans_ first
settled themselves where they now inhabit, or after what manner they
came thither, either by Shipping or by Land; on purpose, or
accidentally; driven by Storm, or else forc’d by a more powerful People,
to remove from their old Plantations, and seek for new? or if any one
should be yet more curious, asking the way that directed them out of
another Countrey to this New World? or else enquire for those People,
from whom the _Americans_ deriv’d themselves? He will find several
Opinions, and the Learned still Jangling.

[Sidenote: Voyage l. 1. c. 8.]

[Sidenote: The time when _America_ was first Peopled.]

The first Doubt is concerning the time: Mr. _Purchas_, where-ever he had
the Hint, endeavors to prove, that _America_ hath been but lately
Planted; for which he thus argues, “That if _Asia_, or _Europe_
furnish’d _America_ with People in _Abraham_’s time, or at least before
the Birth of our Saviour; then it must upon necessity, by the Expiration
of so many Ages, have been much more Populous, then the _Spaniards_
found when first they discover’d it. Besides, the vast Territories yet
unhabited (says he) are sufficient testimonies, that this New World hath
been Planted but scatteringly, and not many Ages since, else the
Countrey would have more abounded with Inhabitants, because the
fertility of the Soyl was able plentifully to maintain Millions more,
then were there when first discover’d: And what Marks are better to know
a new People by, in any Countrey, than a rude Life and unsettled
Government? just like a Family removing to another House, which takes no
short time to settle their Goods and Houshold-stuff in a handsome and
convenient Order.

[Sidenote: The condition of the first World after the Floud.]

“When _Noah_ went out of the Ark on Mount _Ararat_, and not long after,
saw his Seed spread over _Armenia_ and _Assyria_, the new Generation of
People consisted in Shepherds and Husbandmen, that setled themselves
near Lakes and Rivers. Villages, Cities (and much less) whole Kingdoms,
were scarce found on the Face of the Earth, and as little of Trade or
Commerce; Riches, Division of Lands, costly Garments and Furniture for
Houses, were not then in use, but the works of long settlements in happy
Peace. To curb growing-Wickedness, and the Pride of _Libertines_, who
incroach’d upon their weaker Neighbors, Laws were invented, by which
Bridle, the unbroke or wild World grew tamer: And first, the _Assyrians_
were brought to endure the Bit, and answer the Reins of Government; then
_Egypt_, next _Greece_, and after that the _Romans_, who spreading their
Power by Arms and Martial Discipline, first civiliz’d the _Gauls_,
_Spain_, _Brittain_, and lastly _Germany_.

“But because a Countrey or Pastoral Life, knowing no Commerce, but mean
Hovels, and to dwell in Huts, priding in poor and no Habits, despising
all greatness, unlimited by Laws, and all things else, (which the People
observ’d presently after the Flood) is now found among the _Americans_,
who will take them for ought else, but new Comers to that Land, as
themselves acknowledge? For the _Mexicans_ boast, that they are the
eldest there, and that from them, _Peru_, _Chili_, _Chika_, and other
Countreys towards the South, had their Colonies, and yet the oldest
Chronicles of _Mexico_ reckon not above a thousand Years.” Thus far Mr.
_Purchas_.

[Sidenote: _America_ was Peopled many Ages ago.]

[Sidenote: _Purchas_ contradicted.]

But certainly, all this Muster of appearing Reasons, is not able to
vanquish single Truth; For, grant that _America_ was not very Populous
when the _Spaniards_ first arrived there; must this needs prove, that it
was never well inhabited before? Perhaps the Civil Wars, which have been
always destructive to this Nation, have much hindred the increase of
People; and the more, because their Salvage Nature is such, that in
several places they account Man’s Flesh Broil’d a very great Dainty. And
suppose such Prodigal Excess of their Humane Bankets were not us’d in
_America_, as indeed they are, Is it wonder, that such a great part of
the World, not onely exceeding _Europe_ in bigness, but _Asia_ also
should here and there have a Tract of Land uninhabited? These might, by
reason of their Barrenness, be useless, as many such places are found in
the midst of the most Populous and fertile Countreys. But above all
this, it is certain, that _America_ to this day (notwithstanding almost
innumerable thousands of _Indians_ formerly Slain and Massacred by the
_Spaniards_) is so well inhabited, that it may stand in Competition with
either _Asia_ or _Europe_. And how could such vast multitudes Plant the
far-spreading Countrey of _America_, without the help of many Ages?
Moreover, This truth is not without sufficient Testimonies; when any one
looks on the Islands with which _America_ lies incompass’d, he may
suppose they did not willingly go from the Main Continent to the Isles,
but were driven thither by Wars among themselves, or as most times it
happens, because of the vast increase of the Natives, the Countrey must
discharge its burden.

Hereto is added, the several Languages us’d in _America_, as in _Europe_
or any other part of the known World; whereby we may easily guess, that
_America_ was Peopled presently after the Confusion of Tongues at
_Babel_. Furthermore, If the _Americans_ live a Rude Life, go meanly
Habited, be without stately Houses; such Customs are even among us
observ’d by several People; as the _Tartars_, _Numidians_, and others,
which made their Antiquity be call’d in question. He also must needs
have no knowledge of the Arts and Mechanick Sciences us’d by the
_Americans_, who concludes, that they setled but lately in _America_.
One Argument at present will be sufficient to contradict them all; and
in the further Description, the contrary will be more manifest.

[Sidenote: _American_ Gold-Smiths.]

_Hieronimus Benso_ relates, That he stood amaz’d at the Gold and Silver
Smiths in the Territory of _Chito_, who without any Iron Tools, made
Images, and all manner of Vessels: Which work they perform’d thus,
First, they made an Oval Crucible of a good Lock, round about Pasted
with Earth, embody’d with the Powder of Wood Coals; which Crucible being
Bak’d very hard in the Sun, they fill with Pieces of Gold or Silver, and
put in the Fire; about which standing with five, six, or more Pipes made
of Canes, they blow the Fire so long, till the Mettal melts, which
others sitting on the ground, run it into Moulds of black Stone, and so
with little trouble, Cast into what shape they please. Lastly, Though
_Mexico_ can reckon but a thousand years, must it therefore follow, that
the Inhabitants are no older? How many famous places (even among our
selves) have no longer Registers, and if they have, they are commonly
Fabulous, few Nations boasting truly their own Original; which Argument,
not onely contradicts (as we suppose) Mr. _Purchas_, but all others
ascribing the Plantation of _America_ to our later times.


                                SECT. I.

[Sidenote: After what manner the Inhabitants of _America_ came thither.]

¶ In the next place, let us enquire, how the _Americans_ were
transmitted thither, whether by Sea, or Land? Both which are feasible
two several ways; if they made an Expedition thither, as Discoverers, or
were driven on those Coasts by stress of Weather.

The first is most unlikely, and not seeming possible, for how could they
Steer thorow so vast an Ocean, to Countreys they never heard of, without
the Compass, and other Necessaries for such a Voyage? for when first
discover’d, their want of experience in Shipping for so long a Voyage,
knowing no further than the use of small Boats or _Canoos_, plainly
explode, that they willingly Steer’d from a known World, to an unknown,
with no better accommodation; but some probable reasons may be made out,
to induce us to believe, that they were rather driven thither by Storm.

[Illustration]

But some will say, How liv’d the little Boats, and how indur’d they in
such a continual Tempest, and were not either swallow’d up amidst the
Waves, or starv’d for want of Provision, which their hollow Troughs
could not contain?

The first doubt is the least, for there are Examples enough by which
appear, that oftentimes great Ships Bulging, are over-set or sunk in the
Sea by foul Weather when the Mariners escape in their Cock-Boat; and if
they were but thinly Victual’d for so long a Voyage, questionless, that
little which they had, they spun out, and made it last, while the
impetuous Storm shortned the passage, which fair Weather would have made
much longer.

[Sidenote: _Plin_. l. 5. c. 22.]

[Sidenote: Strange voyage of a _Roman_ Slave.]

_Pliny_ tells us of _Annius Plocquius_, General of the _Red-Sea_, That
one of his Slaves being Enfranchiz’d, Sailing down towards the _Arabian_
Gulf, was carry’d by a violent Tempest from the North, beyond
_Caramania_, and on the fifteenth day came to an Anchor in _Hippuros_, a
Haven of _Taprobane_, which _Ortelius_ judges to be _Sumatra_; but
_Mercator_ and _Cluverius_, on better grounds, _Zeylon_, which is no
less than three thousand _English_ Miles.

In like manner, _Joseph de Acosta_ tells us, That in fifteen days time,
he got with a Northerly Wind from the _Canaries_ to _America_, and his
Voyage had been shorter, durst he have born more Sails, which may partly
clear the former doubts.

[Sidenote: The _Peruvians_ opinion concerning antient Sea-Voyages.]

[Sidenote: _Acosta. Histor_. _Nat._ l. 2 c. 12.]

[Sidenote: Ridiculous opinion of the _Americans_.]

Moreover, the _Peruvians_ themselves give some small Testimony (in their
antient Records) of a few that Landed of old upon their Coasts, which
were (as they say) mighty and cruel Giants, committing much Bloodshed,
Slaughtering the Natives every where; and having subdu’d the whole
Countrey, built stately Edifices, of which remain yet the Ruines of some
Foundations, very Artificial and Costly. They also shew near _Manta_,
and _Puerto Viejo_, many huge Bones, as they believe of Giants, three
times longer and thicker than an ordinary Mans. They also tell us, that
many Ages since, one _Ica_ and _Arica_ Sail’d Westward thither upon Sea
Wolves Skins, blown up like Bladders: But however, without
contradiction, the _Americans_ never knew, much less built any such
Vessels, with which they durst venture to the _Offin_, out of sight of
Land: their _Balsas_, _Periagos_, and _Canoos_, will not all amount to
the Bulk of one of our small Barques; wherefore the Inhabitants of
_Tumbez_, when they descry’d the _Spanish_ Fleet, sent to discover
_Peru_, were amaz’d at the high Masts, spreading Sails, and bigness of
the Ships, judging them first to be Rocks, cast up out of the Sea; but
observing them to approach their Coast, and that they were full of
Bearded-Men, thought the Gods were walking in them; by our Modern Poet,
Mr. _Dryden_ in his _Indian Emperor_, thus Elegantly describ’d.


                      Guyomar _to_ Montezuma.

          _I went in order, Sir, to your Command,
          To view the utmost Limits of the Land:
          To see that Shore, where no more World is found,
          But Foamy Billows, breaking on the ground;
          Where, for a while, my Eyes no Object met,
          But distant Skies, that in the Ocean set:
          And low-hung Clouds that dipt themselves in Rain
          To shake their Fleeces on the Earth again.
          At last, as far as I could cast my Eyes
          Upon the Sea, somewhat, methought did rise
          Like Bluish Mists, which still appearing more,
          Took dreadful Shapes, and mov’d towards the Shore._

          Mont. _What Forms did these new Wonders represent?_

          Guy. _More strange than what your Wonder can invent.
          The Object I could first distinctly view,
          Was tall straight Trees, which on the Waters flew;
          Wings on their sides, in stead of Leaves did grow,
          Which gather’d all the Breath the Winds could blow:_

          _And at their Roots grew floating Palaces,
          Whose out-blow’n Bellies cut the yielding Seas._

          Mont. _What Divine Monsters, O ye Gods, were these,
          That float in Air, and fly upon the Seas!_

          _Came they alive or dead upon the Shore?_

          Guy. _Alas, they liv’d too sure, I heard them roar._

          _All turn’d their sides, and to each other spoke,
          I saw their Words break out in Fire and Smoke._

          _Sure, ’tis their Voice that Thunders from on high,
          Or these, the younger Brothers of the Skie._

          _Deaf with the noise, I took my hasty Flight,
          No Mortal Courage can support the Fright._

[Sidenote: _Spaniards_ carry Oxen, and Sheep to the _American_ Isles.]

But the resolving these Doubts, starts a harder Question, _viz._ Grant
that the _Americans_ were by Tempest driven thither, How then came the
Beasts thither? It is certain, that those which are beneficial for
humane use, as Dogs for to Hunt, great Cattel, Sheep, for Food, and
other Necessaries, might easily be carry’d thither, for so the
_Spaniards_ brought Cows, Horses, Swine, and other Cattel; and also
Poultery from _Spain_, to the new-discover’d Isles, _Cuba_,
_Hispaniola_, _Jamaica_, _Margaretta_, and _La Dominica_, when at their
arrival, formerly no four-footed Beasts were found there, whose fertile
Soyl hath so multiply’d their increase, that the Doggs running Wilde,
and breeding as fast, do great hurt to the Grazing Herds, which they
onely shoot for their Skins, leaving their Flesh, the best of Meats,
onely to Manure the Ground on which they lie.

The Transporting of tame and profitable Cattel might easily be allow’d
of, but who would load their Ships with Lions, Tygers, Bears, Wolves,
Foxes, and other Serpents and Voracious Beasts? it is certain that some
may be tam’d before they were Ship’d.

[Sidenote: How wild Beasts came in _America_, and the Isles.]

[Sidenote: In _vita Heliogabali_.]

[Sidenote: Lib. 2. cap. 17.]

[Sidenote: Strange Hunting.]

[Sidenote: Strange accident of two Leopards.]

[Sidenote: _Adv. Jovin._ l. 2.]

_Lampridius_ relates, That _Heliogabalus_ the _Roman_ Emperor, took
great pleasure in Domestick Lions, and Leopards, to frighten his Guests
withal; for with the third Course, they were all brought in, and sate
betwixt the Invited, a Man and a Beast. The great _Cham_, as _Paulus
Venetus_ an Eye-witness attests, Rides on Hunting, attended in couples
with tame Leopards. The King of _Camboja_ in like manner is serv’d with
Panthers: _Scaliger_ adds also, That they went not unprovided of a Lamb
or Goat, to give the Panther, lest falling into his natural ferocity,
provok’d by hunger, he should make the Huntsmen his Quarry, if he had no
other Prey. But notwithstanding some wilde Beasts seem to forget their
Voracious Nature, yet there ought great care to be taken in the
Transporting of them, because they oftentimes grow wild again, which
_France_ can witness, where two Leopards, a Male and a Female being
tam’d, presently after the death of King _Francis_, whether negligently
or on purpose, let loose, ran into the Woods, and near _Orleans_
devour’d a great number of People, and Cattel: _Gesner_ saith, That some
Womens bodies were found, who were untouch’d, onely their Breasts eaten
by the Leopards, as if they took them for the daintiest part; which is
not unlike the antient _Jeres_, who according to Saint _Hierom_,
entertain’d their Guests as a most delicious Dish, with Womens Breasts,
and Mens Buttocks Roasted. Besides, the devouring nature of these Wilde
Beasts, what profit could Tygers, Lions, Wolves, Bears, and the like
advantage the Transporter? And how came Serpents, Adders, and other
Reptiles, thither over the Ocean, that with no Art whatsoever can be
made tame? Were the small Vessels just laden with such terrible
Creatures, when against their wills, they were by Storm driven on a new
Coast? By these impossibilities we may easily judge, that the
_Americans_ came thither by Land, and no other way, but how, and upon
what occasion must be our next enquiry.


                               SECT. II.

[Sidenote: Two reasons wherefore the people remove from their
           Countreys.]

¶ Histories generally gives us onely two accounts, Why People remov’d
from one Countrey to another, either not, or thinly inhabited; whether
driven by force, or of their own accord, so to unburthen and give ease
to their too Plethorick Countreys.

[Sidenote: The Flood acknowledg’d by the _Americans_ and other
           _Heathens_ but mysteriously.]

Thus the banish’d _Japanners_ forsook their Native Countrey, and setled
themselves in a desolate Soyl, since a flourishing Empire, shining with
Riches, and Crown’d with stately Cities: So the _Batavians_ took
possession of the uninhabited Isle, lying between the _Rhyne_, and the
_Wael_, being driven out of _Hessen_ by Civil-Wars, and preserv’d the
memory of the place, from whence they had their Original on the utmost
Point of the Island, in the Villages of _Cattenwyck_; for the _Hessens_
formerly went by the name of _Catti_; others that remov’d did not onely
fall upon their Neighbors, but made a way by force of Arms, chosing
their Habitations under a temperate Climate, and in a fruitful Soyl.
After which manner the _Franks_ enter’d _Gaul_, and afterwards the
_Normans_ set upon _France_; so that the Conquer’d Countreys, have ever
since from the Conquerors been call’d _France_ and _Normandy_: But
although it cannot punctually be said, how the Inhabitants of _America_
remov’d, yet it is without contradiction, that they first found an empty
Countrey. The Opinions which they have themselves concerning it, are
full of idle Fancies; First, they question their Original from the
Floud, which is so well rooted in the memory of all Nations, that the
blindest and most ignorant know something of it, though deformedly
alter’d and vary’d, tack’d up with additional fabulous Stories, the
truth it self known onely to us, but to all others lost in Oblivion.

Who hath not heard of _Deucalion_’s Flood, how his Wife _Pyrrha_ and he
only escap’d in a little Boat, and (as ’tis Fabl’d) landing on a
Mountain, from thence Peopled the World again, by throwing Stones
backwards over their Heads? Something of this seems to hint the true
Story of _Noah_, his Wife, and Children, from whom the desolated World
was replenish’d.

[Sidenote: _Prometheus_ and _Noah_ are the same.]

The same they relate of _Prometheus_, concerning whom, thus _Diodorus
Siculus_: “They say that the _Nyle_ breaking through his Dams, and
over-flowing his Banks, drown’d all _Egypt_, especially that part where
_Prometheus_ Rul’d, where all the Inhabitants were swallow’d by the
Deluge.” None can imagine but that _Diodorus_ by this makes mention of a
particular Flood, and not the general one in _Noah_’s time; for as the
_Greeks_ ascrib’d all things to their _Heroes_, so the _Egyptians_ in
like manner did the same to _theirs_: Therefore they have of the general
Flood, made a particular one in _Egypt_, though perhaps it never was: So
that what is Fabled of _Prometheus_, is nothing but a Part of the
Universal Deluge; which the Name _Prometheus_ proves, because it
signifies, _Sprung from Heaven_, and is the same with _Noah_, whom they
hold to be the first Father of all Mankind since the Flood, born of, or
regenerated from his Wife _Asia_; and _Asia_ signifies _Earth_, or _The
Mother of all things_; and so espousing _Noah_, being sprung from God,
to _Ararat_, from whence descended the Generations of Mankind, and by
degrees spread over the whole surface of the Earth.

[Sidenote: _Acosta_, l. 1. c. 25.]

[Sidenote: Strange Opinion of the _Americans_ concerning the Flood.]

[Sidenote: Original of the _American_ Kings, and their Custom.]

The _Chineses_, _East-Indians_, _Japanners_, and other People of _Asia_
and _Africa_, have also some knowledge of a very ancient Flood; but
hood-wink’t under many idle Fancies, not unlike that which the
_Americans_ relate, from whom several Learned Persons find no obscure
Confessions of the Deluge, which thus mystically they have wrapp’d up,
That one _Viracocha_ came out of the great Lake _Titicaca_, and setled
his Residence upon _Tiaguanaco_, where yet remain the Ruines of ancient
Walls, built after a wonderful manner: At length removing from
_Tiaguanaco_ to _Cusco_, he began to multiply the Generation of Mankind.
They shew in the foremention’d Lake a small Island, under which, the
_Americans_ say, the Sun sav’d himself from the Flood; wherefore in
ancient Times they superstitiously observ’d that place, heightning their
Bloody Sacrifices with Humane Slaughter. Others relate, That six Persons
leap’d through a Hole out of a Window, from whence all Men were since
Extracted; and from that new Increase, the place (after the Inhabitants
of the Old World were all drown’d) got the Denomination of _Pacari
Tampo_; and therefore they hold the _Tampo_’s to be the most ancient
Families: From hence _Mangocapam_ deriv’d, being the Primogenitor of the
_Ynca_’s or Kings; from whom sprung two Generations, _Hanon Cuzco_, and
_Urim Cuzco_. They tell us also, That their _Ynca_’s, when they make War
upon any People, say that the occasion, as they pretend, was, because
all Territories are Tributary to them justly, from whom they were
deriv’d and restor’d, being the first Planters of the New World; and
withal, That the true Religion was declar’d to them from Heaven.

[Sidenote: _Americans_ Flood is taken out of the Scripture.]

This Relation, though mix’d with Fables, shews (but very darkly) that
they have some knowledge of the Flood: For who are those six else that
leap’d out of a Window to replenish the Generations of Mankind, but
_Shem_, _Ham_, and _Japhet_, with their Wives?

[Sidenote: _Peruvians_ Opinion.]

[Sidenote: And also the _Mexicans_, of their Original.]

[Sidenote: Lib. 1. cap. 7.]

The _Americans_ can give but a little better Account of their first
Original; and indeed it is no wonder, because for want of Books they can
relate nothing certain, but only what they have Registred in their usual
_Quipocamagos_, which is not above four hundred years old. _Acosta_
asking what Original they judg’d they were of, and from what Countrey
and People deriv’d? receiv’d no other Answer, but that _America_ only
was their native Countrey, and that they were deriv’d from no other
elsewhere. But though the _Peruvians_ are of this Opinion, yet the
_Mexicans_ are of another mind, giving the _Spaniards_ a far better
Account when first they came thither, wherein we must a little deviate,
_viz._ How they were remov’d from some other place, as _Robert Comtæus_
relates, who with many Learned and seemingly true Arguments affirms,
That the Original of the _Americans_ must be sought for either among the
_Phenicians_, _Sydonians_, _Tyrians_, or _Carthaginians_, being indeed
all one People. _Herodotus_ saith thus of the _Phenicians_, “They liv’d
formerly, according to their own Relation, along the Shore of the
_Red-Sea_; from whence removing, they planted the Sea-Coast of the
_Syrians_.” _Festus Avienus_ the _Latin_ Poet agrees with this Opinion,
where he saith,

        _On the_ Phenicians _Coasts the Ocean beats_,
        _Who through the_ Red-Sea _Sailing, chang’d their Seats.
        They were the first that ventur’d through the Seas,
        And freighted Ships with richer Merchandize:
        Fair or foul Weather, They without controule!
        Sought Foreign Trade, directed by the Pole_.

[Sidenote: Original and Habitations of the _Phenicians_, of whom,
           according to several Learned, the _Americans_ are extracted.]

_Aristotle_ from a _Greek_ Word calls them _Phenicians_, from their
being red or bloody with the Slaughter of all Strangers that Landed on
their Coast; but rather, and so indeed they are call’d _Phenicians_, or
_Erythreans_, from _Esau_, or _Edom_, from whom they are deriv’d; for
these two Words, or Denominations, signifie in _Greek, Red_; the two
last, the like in _Hebrew_. _Phenix_ himself first planted all the
Countrey lying between the River _Eleutherus_, and the _Egyptian_ City
_Pelusium_; and afterwards _Damiata_, wash’d by the _Mediterrane_: But
since, these Boundaries are alter’d, on the North, by _Judea_; Westward,
by the _Mediterrane_; Southerly, by _Egypt_; and towards the East, by
the Desart _Arabia_.

The chiefest Cities are _Ptolemais_, otherwise call’d _Acon_, _Sidon_,
_Arad_, _Great Cana_, _Sarepta_, _Biblis_, _Bothris_, _Berithus_, and
their Princess _Tyre_, formerly scituate in an Isle, but since joyn’d to
the Main-Land by _Alexander the Great_.

[Sidenote: _Herodot._ lib. 1 .]

[Sidenote: _Salust_ in _Igurtha_.]

[Sidenote: Wonderful Power of the _Phenicians_.]

None can disown, but that the _Phenicians_ have every where been
Admirals of the Sea; so that they were formidable to the greatest
Princes. When the _Persian_ King _Cambyses_ came with a vast Army
against the _Carthaginians_, he was forc’d to give over his Design,
because the _Phenicians_ refus’d to help him with their Fleet, being
allied to, and the City founded by them: But they not only built
_Carthage_, which strove with _Rome_ to be the Empress of the World, but
also the famous Cities _Leptis_, _Utica_, _Hippo_, and _Adrumetum_ in
_Africa_, with _Cadiz_ and _Tartessus_ in _Spain_; nay, they sent
Plantations of People into the Heart of _Iberia_ and _Lybia_. It will
not be amiss to add _Q. Curtius_ his Relation, who tells us, “Where-ever
the _Phenicians_ came with their Fleets, Landing their Men, they subdu’d
whole Countreys, and by that means spread their Colonies over the known
World; _Carthage_ in _Africa_, _Thebes_ in _Boetia_, and _Cadiz_ near
the _Western Ocean_.” _Aristotle_ relates, “That they made such rich
Returns of their Merchandize, and chiefly of their Oyl, in _Spain_, that
their Anchors, Pins, and all Iron Materials belonging to a Ship, in
stead of that Metal, were Silver.”

[Sidenote: Testimonies that the _Americans_ are deriv’d from the
           _Phenicians_.]

[Sidenote: First Testimony.]

[Sidenote: Is contradicted.]

[Sidenote: _Lib. 3. Geogr._]

[Sidenote: _Flemmish Islands._]

[Sidenote: _Lib. 17._]

But to return to our Discourse, and disprove the former Testimony, That
the _Phenicians_ found _America_. The formention’d _Comtæus_ saith thus;
“None can justly doubt, but that since the _Phenicians_ took the Command
of the Sea from the _Rhodians_, they more and more increas’d their
Fleets, and growing experter in Navigation, passing the _Gibraltar_
Northward, became Masters of _Cadiz_, and still prepar’d new Fleets,
which searching beyond _Atlas_ Southward, discover’d the Coasts of
_Africa_, and the adjacent Isles, driving a great Trade to the
_Canaries_, and to those which lay scatter’d along _Cape de Verd_,
formerly call’d the _Gorgades_. This way of Trade also was not unknown
to the _Greeks_, _Iberians_, and other People; but after the
_Phenicians_ assum’d it wholly to themselves, without any respect or
difference of Countreys, they sunk all whomsoever they could catch.”
_Curtius_ further adds, saying, “I believe that the _Phenicians_,
sailing into the Main Ocean, have discover’d unknown Countreys.” And
which are those? Not the _Gorgades_, or _Canary Isles_; for those were
sufficiently known before; but a Main Land, far beyond. But though the
_Phenicians_ were most expert, yet not skilful enough to make out such
Discoveries. They indeed were the first that before any other sail’d out
of the Mid-land Sea; nay, they ventur’d a good way into the main Ocean,
beyond the _Straights of Gibraltar_, or the _Herculean Pillars_: But how
far? Not to the _Gorgades_, above half way betwixt _Spain_ and
_America_; but to the _Cassiterides_, or _Flemish Islands_, which to the
number of nine lie in sight of _Spain_. _Strabo_ affirms this Truth,
saying, “The _Cassiterides_ are ten, lying in order close by one
another: One remains uninhabited; on the rest live a swarthy People.”
This way the _Phenicians_ sail’d first, when they were in quest for
Trade, from _Cadiz_. And though he reckons ten, there are indeed but
nine, _viz._ _St. Michael_, _St. Mary_, _St. George_, _Tercera_, _de
Pico_, or _Tenariff_, so call’d from the Mountain which vomits Fire,
_Fayal_, _Las Flores_, _Del Cuervo_, and _Gratiosa_. Moreover, the same
_Strabo_ relates, “That the _Carthaginians_ did not throw over-board the
Traders on the remote _Gorgades_, but those especially that came from
_Sardinia_ or _Cadiz_.”

[Sidenote: _Salt-Islands_ how long known.]

[Sidenote: _Joan. Mariana de Reb. Hispan._ lib. 1. cap. 20.]

[Sidenote: Very remarkable Voyage of _Hanno_ the _Carthaginian_, along
           the Coast of _Africa_ to the _Salt-Islands_.]

[Sidenote: Strange Vision.]

[Sidenote: The Ancients believ’d Baboons to be Men.]

Mean while, we cannot deny, but that the _Gorgades_ that lye before
_Cape de Verd_ were frequented by the _Carthaginians_, long before the
Birth of our Savior; but with so much admiration, that _Hanno_ their
Captain in that Expedition was listed amongst the number of their
Heroes, hapning thus: The _Carthaginians_ sailing for _Cadiz_, to assist
the _Phenicians_ against the _Spaniards_, made that the Seat of War,
which soon drew on a greater Design; for _Hamilco_ and _Hanno_ being
impowr’d by the Senate at _Carthage_, manag’d the War in _Spain_. Both
of them were ambitious to discover new Countreys. _Hamilco_ sail’d along
the Coast of _Spain_ and _Gaule_, reaching to _Batavia_. _Hanno_ steer’d
Southerly, carrying thirty thousand Men of all Trades in his Fleet,
purposing to build a new City in some place or other, and got beyond the
Promontory _Ampelusium_, now call’d _Cabo Spatil_; the River _Ziloa_,
which washeth the City _Arzilla_; and the Stream _Lix_, now _Lusso_,
where the Poets place the Gardens of the _Hesperides_, in the custody of
a waking Dragon: From thence proceeding on his Voyage, he came to an
Anchor in the Mouth of the River _Subur_, at this day call’d _Subu_; and
afterwards before the City _Sala_, now call’d _Salle_, at that time made
very dangerous by the voracious Beasts in the neighboring Woods: At last
the Fleet reach’d the Foot of the lesser _Atlas_, which ends at the
Point _Chaunaria_, by the Modern Navigators call’d _Cabo Non_, because
it was judg’d, that none could scape with Life, that durst adventure to
steer beyond _Chaunaria_; yet _Hanno_ sail’d between _Palma_, one of the
_Canary-Islands_, and the Promontory _Bojadoris_, towards the pointed
Coast call’d then _Cornu Hesperium_, but now _Cape Verd_, in the River
_Asama_, by _Castaldus_ call’d _Omirabi_: Here he found horrible
Croccodiles, and _Hippopotami_ or Sea-Horses. _Atsama_ is held to flow
from the same Fountain whence the _Nyle_ hath its Original. In this
Latitude _Hanno_ descried those Islands which he call’d _Gorgones_ (from
the three deform’d Sisters _Medusa_, _Sthenio_, and _Euryale_, whose
Heads were Periwig’d with curl’d Serpents) because they found as
illfavor’d Women on these Islands, which at this day the _Hollanders_
call the _Salt-Islands_; amongst which, the chiefest is _St. Jago_, a
Colony of _The Portuguese_; but the Mountains opposite to the
_Gorgones_, on the main Coast of _Africa_, rising aloft with spiring
tops near the River _Masitholus_, _Hanno_ call’d the _Chariots of the
Gods_, now nam’d _Sierra Liona_, lying in eight Degrees Northern
Latitude. When _Hanno_ and his Armado, either provok’d by an undaunted
Courage, or covetous of fame, if they proceeded in their so wonderful
Adventure, went forward, where they reported, that they saw Rivers of
Fire falling into the Ocean, the Countrey all about burning, and the
tops of the Mountains dazleing their Eyes with continual Flashes of
Lightning, intermix’d with terrible Thunder; adding further, That the
Natives all the Summer shelter’d themselves from the excessive Heat, in
Caves under Ground; and coming forth in the night, run abroad with
lighted Torches over their Ground, so gathering in their Harvest, and
Officiating all other Affairs of Husbandry: Yet _Hanno_ no ways daunted
at such strange Sights, sail’d from _Sierra Liona_ Southerly to the
_Æquinox_, where he discover’d an Island not far from the _African_
Coast, inhabited by a rough and hairy People, to take some of whom, he
us’d all possible means, yet could not; onely two Women, being
incompass’d by Soldiers, were taken, and carried aboard; but being very
salvage, and barbarously wild, could not be tamed, or brought to any
Complacency; so they kill’d them, and carried their stuff’d-up Skins to
_Carthage_, where they were a long time gaz’d upon with great
admiration.

[Sidenote: The Island _St. Thomas_.]

This Island which _Hanno_ then found, can be no other but that which we
call _St. Thomas_, and hath a very unhealthy Air for Strangers, but else
very fruitful, and abounding with Sugar-Canes; and the hairy People
which he makes mention of, were _Babeons_, or _Baboons_, which _Africa_
in this place breeds large, to the amazement of the Beholders, in great
abundance; because those deform’d Monsters, more than any other Beast
whatsoever, represent Humane shape.

[Sidenote: _Hanno_’s Return.]

[Sidenote: Is for his Voyage plac’d amongst the Gods.]

Here _Hanno_ stopp’d his Voyage, being hindred from going further for
want of Provision. Five years he spent in this Expedition, before he
Anchor’d again at _Cadiz_, from whence not long after he steer’d to his
Native Countrey _Carthage_, where he was receiv’d with no less Wonder
than State, insomuch that none before or after him ever gain’d greater
Honor, seeming to oblige his Countrey with the hopes of future Profits
from these new discover’d Regions: Nay, he receiv’d a Name, and was
plac’d amongst their Gods in the Temples, which he being ambitious of,
promoted after a strange manner, teaching several Birds to cry, _The
great God Hanno_; which when they could speak perfect, they were let fly
in the Air, where to the admiration of all People, they every where
repeated their well-taught Lesson.

This the most remarkable Voyage which hapned in the time of the
Ancients, considering they wanted several Mathematical Instruments
belonging to Navigation, and especially the use of the Compass; and also
considering the length of the Voyage to _Sierra Liona_, whither never
any durst venture before: Nay, in so many Ages after _Hanno_, the
famousest Navigators which were set out by the King of _Portugal_,
fear’d a long time to cut their Passage through the _Æquinoctial-Line_;
however in long Process of time, divers Experiments were made, which
have now so much improv’d the Art of Navigation.

[Sidenote: Testimony that _America_ was not known to the Ancients.]

_Hanno_’s Voyage was four hundred years before the Birth of our Savior;
therefore if none have been further than _Hanno_, until the time the
_Portuguese_ sail’d beyond _Cape de Bona Esperanza_, how could _America_
be discover’d by Sea? How did they steer from the _Salt-Islands_, or
_St. Thomas_, out of sight of Land, through the Main Ocean, to an
unknown World? _Hanno_ himself, who was the stoutest of all Ancient
Navigators, not only crept along the _African_ Coast, which made him
spend so much time; but not daring to cross over those wide spreading
Bays he found, left not his hold of the Shore, and measur’d and search’d
every winding Inlet and Creek: And if he found a New World, why was it
not known? The more, because his Ambition carry’d him on to get a Name
and Reputation by such Naval Discoveries. And how true the Relation of
this Expedition is, _Pliny_ tells us, saying, The Journal-Books were
then to be seen which _Hanno_ writ in that his _African_ Expedition:
Though many of the _Greeks_, and also of our Moderns, following _Hanno_,
have found several things contrary to his Observations, wherein he makes
mention of several Cities built by him, which none ever since heard of,
or any have seen, neither is there the least Marks of their Ruines to be
found.

This large Relation serves for nothing else, but to shew that they seek
in vain herein to give the Honor of the Discovery of _America_ to the
Ancients; And as little do those Testimonies signifie that are taken out
of _Diodorus Siculus_, _Pliny_, _Pomponius Mela_, and _Ælian_. It will
be worth our time to hear every one of them particularly.

[Sidenote: _Lib. 6. cap. 7._]

[Sidenote: Second Testimony, that the _Americans_ are deriv’d from the
           _Phenicians_.]

First, _Diodorus_ saith, “Beyond _Lybia_, in the Ocean, lies a very
great Island, several days sailing in Circumference, having a very
fruitful Soil, and pleasant Meadows, distinguish’d by Hills, and
moistned by Navigable Rivers, unknown in Ancient Times, because it seems
to be separated from the other World, and was thus found: The
_Phenicians_ sailing along the _Lybian_ Coast, were several days and
nights toss’d with perpetual Tempests, and at last driven to the
foremention’d Island, where Anchoring, and observing the pleasant
Scituation thereof, made it known to their Magistrates.”

[Sidenote: _Is contradicted._]

But how comes this nameless Island to be _America_? What Man would take
that for an Island, which far exceeds the main Continent of _Asia_? And
have the _Phenicians_ ascrib’d the finding of this New World to any?
Whence then proceeds such great silence amongst all the Ancient Writers
of a whole World, who otherwise us’d to give Denominations to the least
remote Village, or Mountain, or River?

[Sidenote: _Lib. 5. cap. 1._ Description of _Atlas_.]

_Pliny_ speaks after the same manner, saying, “The Writers make mention,
that _Atlas_ rises out of the middle of the Sands, with a Shrubby and
Bushy top towards the Sky, on the Shore of the Ocean to which he gives
his Denomination; That it is full of Woods, and water’d by several
Fountains on that side towards _Africa_, by which means it bears all
manner of Fruit. In the Day-time none of the Inhabitants appear, all
things being in silence, as in the middle of a Desart; the Approacher is
struck with sudden amazement. And besides its excessive high Crown,
reaching above the Clouds, and neighboring, as they say, the Circle of
the Moon, appears in the Night as if it were all in a Flame, resounding
far and near with Pipes, Trumpets, and Cymbals; and the Journey up
thither, very long and dangerous.”

I cannot understand that _Pliny_ can mean _America_ by this, because
himself, in the first Division of his Fifth Book, makes his beginning
with the Description of _Africa_: And as to what further concerns the
strange Relation and danger thereof, is a little before related in
_Hanno_’s Voyage; and it is but a slight Argument to prove it _America_,
because it seems to resound with those sorts of Instruments which the
_Americans_ were observ’d to use when discover’d.

[Sidenote: _Lib. 1. cap. 4._]

[Sidenote: Strange Men.]

_Pomponius Mela_ being the third, hath no greater Arguments than the
former. “We hear (says he) that utmost People towards the West, being
the _Atlanticans_, are rather half Beasts than Men, cloven-footed,
without Heads, their Faces upon their Breasts, and naked, with one great
Foot, like Satyrs or Goblins, which range up and down, without any
Artificial Shelters or Houses.”

[Sidenote: _Lib. 3. cap. 18._]

[Sidenote: Discourse between _Midas_ and _Silenus_ concerning the
           Unknown World.]

Lastly, _Ælian_ seems to say something, when he sets down the Discourse
between _Midas_ and _Silenus_, out of _Theopompus_, where _Silenus_
relates, “That _Europe_, _Asia_, and _Lybia_ are Islands; and that a
vast Countrey lyes beyond this his tripple-divided World, mighty
Populous, and abounding with all other Living Creatures, as big again as
ours, and living twice as long: That they are wondrous rich; their
Religions, Laws, and Customs, founded upon another Morality and Reason,
quite different from ours. They boast especially of two great Cities,
_Machimus_ and _Eusebes_; the Inhabitants of the first maintaining
themselves by driving altogether a Trade of War, mustering up, and
filling their numerous Regiments with several valiant Nations. The
Listed Citizens amount in their Muster-Rolls, all bred to Soldiery, to
two Millions, of whom few but scorn either dying bravely by Wounds
receiv’d With Flint-edg’d Laths, and Staves, in stead of Spears, pointed
with Stones, not knowing the use of Iron or Steel, but so over-stock’d
with Gold and Silver, that they account it a Drug of less Value than our
basest Metal. Some Years since they march’d into our World, a hundred
thousand strong, as far as the _Hyperborean_ Mountains, where being
inform’d, that all the Nations of our World, compar’d with them, liv’d
in a poor and despicable condition; as not thinking them worth their
Conquest, they return’d. But the second City _Eusebes_, deals altogether
in Peace, and its Citizens are not rapacious, but exercise Justice, so
much affecting Morality and Divine Worship, that they conquer Heaven by
their Piety and Meekness, and the Gods themselves are pleas’d to
descend, and advise with them concerning their Celestial Affairs.”

Who observes not this to be a Poetical Relation, shewing how much better
the Acquirements of Peace are, than those of War; the one conquering
only Men, the other, the Gods? Nor can more be taken out of _Ælian_’s
Discourse, but that the Ancients believ’d there was another Habitable
World to be our _Antipodes_.

[Sidenote: Inquiries whether the Constitutions of the _Phenicians_ agree
           with the _Americans_.]

Thus far hath been disputed concerning the Original of the _Americans_,
whose Plantations from _Tyre_ or _Carthage_ by Sea, are found altogether
invalid: Yet we will search a little further, to see whether the People
Analogize, either in their Religion, Policy, Oeconomy, or Customs.

It is certain, that the ancient _Phenicians_ liv’d in Tents, and
sometimes exchang’d eaten-up Pastures for fresh, which the _Americans_
to this day observe; by which it might appear, that they are of a
_Phenician_ Extract. But why not as well deriv’d from _Numidia_,
_Tartary_, or the ancient Patriarchs, who all liv’d such an unsettl’d
wandering Life? Besides, the _Phenicians_ had a long time given over
Pastoral Business, for Maritime Affairs of greater consequence, not only
Merchandizing through all the World, but sending great Colonies in Ships
to new Plantations: And moreover, the _Americans_ could not so strangely
degenerate from their Ancestors, but would have built great Cities like
them; of which many were found in _Phenicia_, but none of Antiquity in
_America_.

[Sidenote: As also both their Religions.]

As to their Religion, if it agreed with the _Phenicians_, it was the
same that all the World profess’d at that time, and therefore may as
well be extracted from any other, as them: ’Tis true, we find them
inclin’d to Sorcery, and dealing with Evil Spirits, as the _Phenicians_,
in which they were not only guilty, but all other Nations at that time.

[Sidenote: The Known World formerly full of Witches.]

[Sidenote: _De Nat. Dæmon._ l. 3.]

[Sidenote: _Lucan._ lib. 6.]

Nay, why not as well transported out of _Asia_ or _Europe_, where were
formerly many the like Tamperers, and those that dealt in such
Diabolical Sciences? And why not from _Salmantica_, where, as
_Laurentius Ananias_ relates, Magick-Arts were publickly taught, and
they commenc’d Doctors, and took their Degrees according to their
Learning? The Devil also hath publick Worship amongst the _Americans_,
and so he had with the _Phenicians_: yet not only they, but the whole
World had dedicated Temples to him. Here began Humane and Infernal
Sacrifices, supposing that Evil Spirits were delighted, and so feasted
with the Steam of Humane Offerings, whose sweetness made them milder,
and so intoxicating, lull’d them into less mischief.

[Sidenote: Devil-worship formerly us’d in all the World, and now by the
           _Americans_.]

[Sidenote: _Lev. 17. 6._]

[Sidenote: Idols in Ships.]

How famous is _Zoroaster_, and the whole School of the Eastern
Magicians? In _Moses_’s time this Wickedness had already took place: Nor
can it be deny’d but that the _Phenicians_ carry’d their Idols in their
Ships, as _Herodotus_ testifies, saying, “The Image of _Vulcan_ much
resembles the _Phenicians Patacoioi_, which they plac’d on the
Fore-castle of their Ships.”

In like manner, the _Americans_ when they go to Sea, carry their Idols
with them; and the Ships took Name from the Image, which was either
painted or carv’d on the Stern, or plac’d elsewhere upon the Deck.

The same Custom the _Chineses_ observe to this present: _Francis
Xaverius_ relates, “That he sail’d in a _Chinese_ Vessel from _Goa_ to
_Japan_, which bore an Idol in its Stern, before which the Master
lighted Candles, perfum’d it with Aloe-wood, and offer’d Birds and other
Food, inquiring of it the Event of his Voyage. Sometimes he judg’d from
the Statues immovable Looks, that it would fall out successfully; and
other times, not.”

[Sidenote: _De abstinent. Animal._ l. 2.]

[Sidenote: _Prepar. Evang._ lib. 1.]

Lastly, _Porphyrius_ relates, “That the _Phenicians_ upon any great
Exigency, as War, excessive Heat, or Mortal Distempers, by order
selected one of the most comely and beautiful of their Children, to be
offer’d up to _Saturn_.” And _Eusebius_ saith also out of _Porphyrius_,
“That _Saturn_, whom the _Phenicians_ call _Israel_, the Learned
_Vossius_ and _Hugo Grotius_ read _Il_, or _El_ (one of the ten Names of
God in _Hebrew_) which they also give to the Planet _Saturn_, who when
he Reign’d in _Phenicia_, having one only Son born by the Nymph
_Anobret_, and was in danger to lose his Kingdom, being worsted in an
unlucky War, he dress’d him in Royal Robes, and placing him on an Altar
built for that purpose, sacrific’d him with his own Hands.”

[Sidenote: Men and Children used for Sacrifices by the _Phenicians_ and
           other People.]

[Sidenote: Who forbade the sacrificing of Men.]

And although such like cruel Oblations are us’d in _America_, must it
therefore follow, that they are deriv’d from the _Phenicians_, when
several other People are guilty of the same? Nay, there is scarce one
Countrey, which hath not at some time or other perform’d such inhumane
Acts, seeming to them Zeal in their Religion; for the most eminent of
the Heathens scrupled not at it, which certainly are held to be the
_Persians_, _Greeks_, and _Romans_; and yet they were not abhorr’d,
though committing Humane Slaughters.

This holy Butchery and Religious Slaughter of Mankind began in _Rome_ in
the Emperor _Adrian_’s Reign, so continuing till the time of
_Tertullian_, _Lactantius_, and _Eusebius_. The _Greeks_ which inhabited
the utmost part of _Italy_, employ’d themselves daily in Sacrificing
Strangers to _Saturn_, and sometimes one another. But at last this
formal Cruelty became a ridiculous Custom; for the _Romans_ by severe
Edicts strictly forbad all such Humane Offerings: Yet that they might
retain some memory of their former Sacrifices, they order’d thirty
Images to be made of Rushes, which every year on the fifteenth of
_April_, were by the _Roman_ Priests and Vestal Nuns, to be thrown from
the _Milvian_ Bridge into the _Tyber_.

[Sidenote: _Lib. de Superstit._]

Moreover, _Manethon_ relates, “That the _Egyptians_ in _Heliopolis_ us’d
to offer three Men at once to _Juno_; which Custom was observ’d till
King _Amasis_ order’d, That in stead of Men, they should serve her with
Wax Candles.”

_Amestris_, Queen to the famous _Xerxes_, caus’d twelve Men to be burn’d
alive, as an Oblation, to pacifie and oblige _Pluto_ to maintain them in
their present Grandeur.

[Sidenote: _Rer. Persic._ l. 1.]

_Procopius_ relates of the People about the _Arabian Gulph_, “That they
oftentimes Sacrific’d Men to the Sun.”

[Sidenote: _Lib. 3. sect. 8 Geogr._]

“The _Indians_, saith _Pomponius Mela_, kill their nearest Relations and
Parents, before they decay by Sickness or Age, and judg’d it fit and
most Religious to Feast and Banquet themselves with the Entrails of the
slain.”

[Sidenote: _Lib. 11. Geog._]

The _Albanians_, as _Strabo_ relates, offer yearly one of their Priests
to the Moon.

The same _Mela_ relates of the _Tauri_, That they us’d to cut the
Throats of Strangers, whenever they came near to the Place of their
Sacrifice.

[Sidenote: _Lib. 2. cap. 1_.]

The _Egyptian_ Idol _Typhon_, as you may read in _Manethon_, was daily
made red-hot, and living People put in, and broyl’d to death.

[Sidenote: _Bell. Gall. Comm._]

But to pass by several other People guilty of such bloody Idolatry, How
did the Altars erected in the Woods in _Gaul_ and _Germany_, for
_Taran_, _Hesus_, _Teutates_, and _Woden_, continually smoke with the
Blood of Humane Expiations? Of which _Cæsar_ saith thus in his
_Commentaries_; “The _Gauls_ are a very Devout and Superstitious Nation;
and therefore when any were dangerously sick, or likely to be worsted in
Battel, they vow’d to feast their Gods that sav’d them with Humane
Flesh, and if need were, would make themselves a thankful Sacrifice to
those that help’d them off in such an Exigence. Concerning these bloody
Rites, they consulted and imploy’d the _Druydes_, by whose advice they
all believ’d that no Victim was so acceptable to the _Numens_, as
pour’d-out Humane Blood, but especially that of Malefactors; which
Dainty if they could not procure, their Gods must be treated with the
Lives of the Innocent.”

[Sidenote: _2 Reg. 3. v. 26, 27._]

Lastly, the Holy Scripture saith thus, _When the King of_ Moab _saw that
the Battel was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred Men that
drew Swords, to break through even to the King of_ Edom; _but they could
not. Then he took his eldest Son, that should have reigned in his stead,
and offered him for a Burnt-offering on the Wall._

These Testimonies are sufficient Witnesses, That the Ancient _Heathens_
express’d the height of their Devotion, and fury of mad Zeal, in such
execrable Rites, as to this day the like is practised by the _Indians_,
_Chineses_, _Japanners_, and others: Wherefore it can no ways be a
sufficient ground to prove, that the _Americans_ are deriv’d from the
_Phenicians_, because of their Humane Sacrifices, for that they were
usual Customs in all Places.

[Sidenote: Third testimony, That the _Americans_ are deriv’d from the
           _Phenicians_, because their Language agrees]

[Sidenote: Is contradicted.]

The third Proof they offer us, is borrow’d from the similitude and
likeness of the _Phenician_ and _American_ Languages: _Comtœus_ sets
down some Words, _viz._ the _Phenicians_ call’d a Mountain, _Abila_;
Blood, _Edom_; a Mother, _Anech_; a Maid, _Hellotia_; Water, _Heni_, and
_Jam_: With the first agrees the _American_ _Anthla_; with the second,
_Holedonch_; with the third, _Anam_; with the fourth, _Hellotie_; with
the fifth, _Ame_, and _Jame_. But those that will thus corrupt the
Words, may as well make the unseemliest Comparisons. It is certain, that
the _Phenicians_ and some of the _Americans_ call a Cup _Asur_, and Red
Wine, _Belàsa_; But does it therefore follow by this, that the one is
extracted from the other? How many Names do signifie all one, amongst
People that never had any Conversation together? This proceeds only from
meer accident; Or else if some Words of one, sound like the same Words
us’d in a remote Countrey, and be of one signification, must they
therefore be deriv’d from one another? Then upon necessity the _Greeks_,
_Latins_, and _Germans_ had their Original from the _Hebrews_, or the
_Latins_ from the _Greeks_, or the _Germans_ from the _Latins_, or the
_Persians_ from the _Germans_; or, on the contrary, the last owe their
Extract to the first. I will as a Testimony, and to give you a Pattern,
pick out a few from a greater number.

[Sidenote: _Greek_ and _Hebrew_ agree]

[Sidenote: Also the _Hebrew_ and _Latin_.]

How little difference is there in many Words between the _Greek_ and
_Hebrew_? The _Hebrews_ call a Church-Congregation _Sanhedrim_, the
Greeks Συνέδριον; the Greeks for _I advise_, use πείθω, the other פתה;
the _Hebrews_ call Wise-men _Zophei_, the other Σόφοι: And less
difference there is between _Symphoniah_ and Συμφονία, _A well-set
Lesson_; or _Psanterin_ and Ψαλτέριον, _A Spiritual Hymn_: And who also
will not find a near resemblance in the consonating of divers _Latin_
and _Hebrew_ Words? For there is little difference betwixt _Mesurah_ and
_Mensura_, _a Measure_; _Shekar_ and _Saccarus_, _a sweet Moisture_;
_Levya_ and _Leæna_, _a Lioness_, _Sabbeca_ and _Sambuca_, _a
Chopping-board_; _Pesa_ and _Passus_, _a Pace_.

[Sidenote: Likewise the _Teutonick_, the great Language of _Germany_,
           _Britain_, the _Low-Countreys_, and other Northern Nations.]

Then starting over the _Greek_ and _Latin_, the _Teutonicks_ would
likewise produce many Words which have the same sound and signification
with the _Hebrew_; as _Chobel_, _a Cable_; _Ethmol_ and _Etmael_,
_Watching_; _Sothim_ and _Sotten_, _Fools_; the _Hebrew_ _Arets_, is in
_Dutch_, _Aerde_, or as we in _English_, _Ear’d Lands_; _Phert_ and
_Peert_, _a Horse_; _Levyah_ and _Leeuw_, _a Lion_; _Shad_ and
_Schadea_, _Damages_; _Kisse_ and _Kussen_, in our Dialect the very
same, _Kisse_; _Shaken_ and _Schenken_, _a giving_, whence we derive our
_English_ _Skinker_, from serving of Drink; _Bel_ and _Beeld_, _an
Image_; for _Bel_ properly signifies _Lord_, perhaps because the Images
of Heroes or Lords were worshipp’d by them, or else because _Ninus_
first erected an Image for his Father _Belus_, or _Bel_, to be
worshipp’d.

[Sidenote: _Greek_ and _Latin_ Tongues agree.]

[Sidenote: _Abrah. Milii, Ling. Belg._ c. 5, 6, 7, 11.]

It would make a large Volume it self, to reckon up the Consonancies of
the _Hebrew_, _Greek_, and _Latin_, and their scatterings among all
Languages where ever their Empire spread, the one being indeed borrow’d
from the other, as all Languages that deal or have any converse
together: For not only the Words, with some small Alterations of
Letters, signifie the same in both Languages; but also without the least
alteration. Both _Greeks_ and _Latins_ express _I do_, by _Ago_; the
Number _Eight_, by _Octo_; _an Arm_, by _Brachium_ or _Brachion_, in
_English_, _Branches_, and _Braces_; _I eat_, by _Edo_; _a Cup_, by
_Phiale_; _a Curtain_, by _Cortina_, or _Cortine_; _Merry_, by
_Hilaris_, or _Hilaros_; _a ratling Noise or Sound_, by _Clango_; _a
Camel_, by _Camelus_, or _Camelos_; _a Knee_, by _Genu_, or _Gonu_; _a
Bowl_ or _Chalice_, by _Calix_; _a Mouse_, by _Mus_; _Deceit_, by
_Dolus_, or _Dolos_; _a House_, by _Domus_, or _Domos_; _I carry_, by
_Fero_, or _Phero_; the Pronoun _I_, _Ego_; _a Lion_, by _Leo_, or Λέων;
_Flax_, by _Linum_, or _Linon_; _a Mother_, by _Mater_, or _Meter_;
_now_, by _nunc_, or _nun_; _the Night_, by _Nox_, or _Nux_; _a
Rock-stone_, by _Petra_; _a Nick-name_, by _Scomma_, or _Skomma_; _a
Boat_, by _Scapha_, or _Skaphe_; _a Treasure_, by _Thesaurus_, or
_Thesauros_; _Father_, by _Pater_; _I tremble_, by _Tremo_; _an Hour_,
by _Hora_; _the Evening_, by _Vespera_, or _Hespera_; and an innumerable
many Words more, that are of one signification in both.

[Sidenote: _Phenician_ and _American_ Tongues have no similitude.]

[Sidenote: _Americans_ much divided in Speech and People.]

Now if there is not the hundredth part of the resemblance found between
the _American_ and _Phenician_ Tongues, as there is between the
_Hebrew_, _Greek_, _Latin_, and _Dutch_, according to the foremention’d
Examples, which notwithstanding cannot be observ’d to be deriv’d from
one another, what testimony can there be in five or six Words, which
only have a few Letters that do not differ? But suppose that the
agreeing of the _Phenician_ and _American_ Tongues could serve for a
testimony; that these last People had their Original from the first,
then there remains another doubt, _viz._ To know what _Americans_
acknowledge the _Phenicians_ for their Fathers; because their Countrey
is so big, that it may almost stand in competition with all the other
three parts of the Known World, being divided by so many Nations, which
differ not only in their various Customs, but also in their several
Languages, most of them not having the least likeness one with another:
Nay, often times the Inhabitants of one Province differ so much in
Dialect, that, according to _Petrus de Cieca_, the one cannot understand
the other.

[Sidenote: In _America_ one Tongue is not at all like the other.]

[Sidenote: _Decad. 3._]

[Sidenote: _De Laet. Orig. Amer. obs. 5._]

_John de Laet_ observes out of _Peter Martyr_, and other Writers
concerning the _West-Indies_, That there are several Languages and
strange Words spoken among the divers Inhabitants of _America_; for the
_Hurones_ call a Head _Sionta_; the _Mexicans_, _Tzontecontli_; the
Inhabitants of _New-Netherland_, _Anonsi_; the _Brasilians_, _Acanga_;
the _Jaos_, _Boppe_: the Figures One, Two, Three, and Four, the
_Hurones_ tell thus, _Escate_, _Teni_, _Hachin_, _Dac_; the _Mexicans_,
_Ce_, _Ome_, _Yei_, _Nabuy_; the _Sankikanders_, _Cotte_, _Nysse_,
_Nacha_, _Wyve_; the _Brasilians_, _Oyepe_, _Mocoy_, _Mocapir_,
_Oirundi_; the _Jaos_, _Tewyn_, _Tage_, _Terrewaw_, _Tagyne_; the
Natives of _New-Netherland_, _Onsat_, _Tiggani_, _Asse_, _Cayere_.
Moreover the _Hurones_ call a Father _Aystan_; the _Mexicans_, _Tathli_;
the _Canadensers_, _Notaovi_; in _New-Netherland_, _Ragina_; in
_Brasile_, _Tuba_: And so it is generally with all other Words, which
agree not in the least one with the other; so that every Territory hath
not only a several Dialect, but in many Places they use besides two,
three, or more distinct Speeches, not relating in the least one to
another, in one Province, by which the People inhabiting Towns and
Villages are distinguish’d. The Islanders discover’d by the _Spaniards_,
and destroy’d, have left few Words behind them; yet _Peter Martyr_ sets
down some of them, which were formerly us’d in _Hispaniola_: They call’d
Heaven _Tures_; a House, _Boa_; Gold, _Cauni_; a good Man, _Tayno_. It
is worthy of observation, that they pronounce no _H_ in their Language,
but what is spoken with a Vowel, and then give it a strong Aspiration,
like the warbling guttural ע _Ghain_ of the _Hebrews_.

[Sidenote: Last Testimonies of the _Americans_ Extract from the
           _Phenicians_.]

[Sidenote: Is contradicted.]

[Sidenote: _Franc. Burman._ _in_ Gen. 25. 30.]

[Sidenote: _Phenicians_ deriv’d from _Esau_.]

Our last and chiefest Testimony is _Moses_, who says thus in _Genesis_,
_Cursed be_ Canaan, _a Servant of Servants shall he be unto his
Brethren. Moreover he said, Blessed be the Lord God of_ Shem, _and_
Canaan _shall be his Servant: God shall inlarge_ Japhet, _and he shall
dwell in the Tents of_ Shem; _and_ Canaan _shall be his Servant._ And in
the next Chapter, _Canaan_ begat _Sidon_. These Scriptures are explain’d
as a Testimony of the _Americans_ Extract from the _Phenicians_, which
they ground on these following Reasons: The _Phenicians_ are _Canaan_’s
Successors from _Sidon_, who gave name to their chief City. _Tubal_ the
Issue of _Japhet_, whose Tents God promis’d to enlarge, and that
_Canaan_ should be his Servant, planted _Spain_. The _Phenicians_,
descendants from _Sydon_, (say they) Peopled _America_; the _Spaniards_
sprung from _Tubal_, of _Japhet_, have subjected the _Americans_,
descended from _Sydon_, of _Canaan_; wherein is fulfill’d that Prophecy
of _Moses_, _That_ Canaan _should be Servant to_ Japhet; but it seems a
great mistake, so to derive the _Phenicians_ from _Canaan_, for they are
Extracted from _Shem_, _Heber_, _Abraham_, and _Esau_, sirnam’d _Edom_,
from his saying, _Adom, Adom_, when he ask’d of _Jacob_, _That Red, That
Red_, because he knew not how to call the prepared Pottage by its proper
Name; And _Edom_ setling himself on Mount _Seir_, a part of the Stony
_Arabia_, and on the Coast of the _Red-Sea_, gave denomination to it,
because that Sea was much frequented and Navigated by his Successors.
The _Greeks_ call it _Erythreum_, from _Erythros_, who is the same with
_Esau_, and likewise signifies _Red_. Hereto is added, That _Phænix_ and
_Erythros_ have the same signification in the _Greek_; So then, these
_Idumeans_ taking the name of _Phenicians_, from the great _Phœnix_,
spread themselves far and near under mighty Kings, by Navigation in the
_Red-Sea_, and from thence Planted several Coasts and Islands, removing
at last to _Syria_.

[Sidenote: Gen. 36. 39.]

[Sidenote: _Com. in_ Jer. l. 4. c. 25.]

[Sidenote: _In_ Ps. 136. _Voss. Orig. Idol._ l. 1. c. 31.]

[Sidenote: _Punick_ Tongue.]

[Sidenote: _Hebrew._]

The seventh King of _Edom_, _Moses_ reckoneth to be _Baal-hanan_, which
name, by transposing the Syllables, the famous _Carthaginian_ General
_Hannibal_ bare. Moreover, it may easily be demonstrated, that the
_Phenicians_ Extracted from _Heber_, have formerly spoke _Hebrew_, and
since _Arabick_; for they dwelt before their removing, in the
Stony-_Arabia_. St. _Jerom_ saith, the _Punick_ Tongue agrees for the
most part with the _Hebrew_: And St. _Austin_ tells us, that many, nay,
most of the _Carthaginian_ words are _Hebrew_. _Elisa_, _Dido_, the
first Foundress of _Carthage_ proves this, for _Elisa_ or _Elissah_,
with the _Hebrews_, denotes _A Lamb of my God_; and _Dido_, _A Lover_.
But who can find the least likeness, between the _Hebrew_ or _Arabick_
Tongue with the _Americans_? Lastly, Since the _Phenicians_ acknowledge
_Esau_ for a Father, what then concerns the _Americans_, the curse of
_Canaan_, since they are no more Extracted from _Canaan_, than the
_Phenicians_? Thus much concerning the _Phenicians_.

[Sidenote: If the _Americans_ were deriv’d from the _Jews_, or the ten
           Tribes of _Israel_.]

[Sidenote: Is contradicted.]

Some would derive the _Americans_ from the _Jews_; others, from the ten
Tribes of _Israel_, carry’d into captivity. The ground of which Opinions
is, That the _Jews_ and _Israelites_ were scatter’d amongst all Nations;
therefore they conclude, that _America_ was also Peopled by them, the
rather, because the antient _Jews_ and _Americans_ were of one
Complexion, and went a like Habited, both going without Shooes, onely
wearing Sandals, and an upper Coat over a shorter Linnen Vest. Both are
humble, quick of apprehension, and obliging, yet Valiant: But it is
certain, they cannot be like the _Jews_, because the _Americans_ change
their Habit, according as they live in cold or hot Countreys, and go not
in the least like one another.

Father _Immanuel_ relates, That he saw a _Brasilian_, not onely stoutly
make his party good against three _Portugal_ Soldiers, but had it not
been by meer chance, worsted them.

Lastly, What Ceremonies of Religious Rites are observ’d by the
_Americans_, which are used in _Judaism_? The _Jews_ indeed have
transplanted their Circumcision amongst divers Eastern People, and have
they onely forgot the first Ceremony and signal Badge of their Religion
in _America_, which yet not onely they, but those _Mahumetans_ and other
Sectaries punctually observe?

[Sidenote: _Jews_ distribution.]

[Sidenote: 1 Pet. 1. 1. _Scaliger in Notes ad N. T._]

[Sidenote: Joh. 7. 35.]

[Sidenote: _L. de Idolo. vanitate._]

This makes evident their scatterings about the Face of the Earth, but
will not bring them to reach _America_. The Sacred Text sets forth a
two-fold description of the _Jews_; The one before the Birth of our
Saviour, when they liv’d as strangers in _Pontus_, _Galatia_,
_Cappadocia_, _Asia_, and _Bythinia_. _Jerusalem_ was their Metropolis,
although others had their chief residence in _Babylon_, and
_Alexandria_; for there was an _Asiatick_ and a _European_ dispersion;
those of _Asia_ had _Babylon_ for their chief City, and us’d in their
Synagogues the _Chaldean_ Translation of the Bible. The _Europeans_ kept
their Seat at _Alexandria_, where they had a Temple like that of
_Jerusalem_; and whilst they employ’d themselves in the _Greek_ Version
of the Holy Scripture, by the seventy two Interpreters, under _Ptolomeus
Philadelphus_, they were call’d _Wandering Greeks_: Therefore, certainly
the _Americans_ are not deriv’d from these _Jews_, and with as little
reason from those, which by _Titus Vespasian_, after the destruction of
_Jerusalem_ were driven into several Countreys, for they were never
permitted (that I may borrow the words of St. _Cyprian_) to set forward
one step, though but as Pilgrims, towards their Native Countrey, but
strictly forbidden not to assemble or meet together in any considerable
number, which would have been necessary, if they intended to Plant a new
World.

[Sidenote: 2 Reg. 17. 5.]

[Sidenote: 4 Esd. 13. 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46.]

A small seeming Testimony is added, being taken out of the fourth Book
of _Esdras_, that the ten Tribes of _Israel_ that were carry’d away by
_Salmanassar_ with their King _Hosea_ to _Nahalah_, _Habor_, the River
_Gozan_, and the Cities of the _Medes_, might be acknowledged for the
first Planters of _America_: Concerning which, _Esdras_ saith thus, _The
ten Tribes brought over into another Countrey, consulted that they
should forsake the multitude of the_ Heathens, _and travel to a remoter
Countrey, where no Generation of Mankind had ever liv’d before, there
they would maintain their Laws, which they had not observ’d in their
Countrey: Whereupon they went thither thorow the narrow entrances of the
River_ Euphrates, _for the Almighty stopt the Vains of the River, till
they were past over; for thorow the Countrey was a way of a year and
halfs Journey: wherefore that Tract of Land is call’d_ Assareth, _then
they liv’d there till the last time._

But since these Books of _Esdras_ were not Written by a Prophet, either
in the _Hebrew_ Tongue, or allow’d by the _Jews_ to be the Word of God,
or any where taken notice of in the _New Testament_; wherefore then is
_Assareth_ more _America_ than any other remoter Countrey?

[Sidenote: _L. 5. in Ezek. & l. 6. in Jerom._]

[Sidenote: 4 Esd. 6. 49, 50. & 14. 21. & 4. 41.]

St. _Hierom_ (who certainly had a peculiar knowledge of the condition of
the ten Tribes of _Israel_, because he liv’d in _Asia_, and held
Correspondence with the _Jews_, that he might perfectly learn the
_Hebrew_ Tongue,) relates, “That the ten Tribes (St. _Hierome_ liv’d
about the Year four hundred, under the Emperor _Theodosius_) underwent
great slavery in the Cities of _Medes_ and _Persians_; so that this
strange Voyage to _Assareth_, which must have happen’d long before St.
_Hierom_’s time, may be Recorded amongst the other Legends of the
Rabbies, concerning their _Behemoth_ and _Leviathan_, who lock’d up the
Souls of those that sleighted their Laws, in Caves under ground, as
_Esdras_.”

[Sidenote: Antient condition of the _Persians_.]

[Sidenote: _Melchior Soiterus de Reb. Turc._]

And how little opportunity the _Israelites_ had to remove since his
time, may appear by the horrible Destruction that was made for several
Ages together in _Persia_ and _Media_; for although the _Persians_
became Masters again of the Realm, Conquer’d by _Alexander_ the Great,
whilst _Alexander_’s Successors invaded one another, yet they were
continually in War, either against the _Romans_, or else the _Indians_,
and other Eastern People; nay, the _Saracens_ wrested the Scepter out of
their hand, though but for a small time; for soon after, breaking out
into Factions amongst themselves, _Muchumet Subictigenes_, _Imbrael_’s
Son, establish’d his Throne on their Ruines, and incourag’d by such
success, Arm’d himself against the _Indians_, and made use of the
_Turks_ assistance, with which he subdu’d the _Babylonian Arabians_:
After which, the _Turks_, not without great slaughter see the _Persian_
Crown on their Head, which, immediately totter’d by bloudy Commotions;
for _Tangrolipix_ being King of _Persia_, clashing with his Brother
_Cutlumuses_, made _Persia_ swim in the Blood of a Civil-War, till at
last _Zengis Chan_ brought from _Tartary_ so great an Army, _Anno 1200._
that none durst stay to make opposition; for the _Turks_ forsook
_Persia_ after a Conquest of six Ages, and made their own way for new
Quarters into _Carmania_, _Phrygia_, and _Bithynia_, whence they made
such incursions on the _Greek_ Empire, that at last they became sole
Masters thereof. Who cannot but easily judge by this, how little
opportunity the ten Tribes had, to be assembled together from remote
Countreys, and to go long Journeys through untrack’d ways, and full of
Enemies, to travel to _America_?

[Sidenote: _Mora_’s opinion concerning the _Americans_ Extract.]

_Immanuel de Moraes_, who had gotten peculiar knowledge of the
_Americans_ by his long Conversation with them, judgeth that they are
not deriv’d from one People, but from the _Carthaginians_ and _Jews_,
and that at several times, and places, they Landed in this New World;
for the _Carthaginians_ Sailing thither, found the Soyl so fertile, that
many forsook their Native Countrey to dwell there: Whereupon, it was
forbidden upon pain of Death, to send no more thither, lest if
_Carthage_ should be invaded by a foraign Enemy, it should want People
for a Home-defence: From this occasion it happen’d, that those that were
already Transported, became rude, and of a Salvage Disposition, and
spreading their Families, planted the desolate Countreys in a ranging
manner, without acknowledging any Supreme Head or Governor.

Thus being scatter’d up and down, every one invented to himself a new
Language, which should neither agree with the _Carthaginians_, or any
other: But this Opinion is before at large contradicted.

[Sidenote: Customs and Constitutions of the _Brasilians_ are several.]

Moreover, _Moraes_ endeavors to shew, that the _Brasilians_ are of a
_Hebrew_ Extract, because that according to the example of the _Jews_,
they might not Marry, but in their own Tribes; they also call their
Unkles, Fathers, and their Aunts, Mothers; both mourn for the Dead a
Moneth together, and wear long Garments down to their Ankles. But these
Arguments seem to us of small consequence, for indeed the _Brasilians_
differ in their Marriages from the _Jews_, for they not onely Marry in
their own Tribes, but frequently commix with their Sisters, and
Daughters, or other their nearest Relations. Moreover, the _Jews_ call’d
them Fathers, from whose Loyns they sprang many Ages before, as well as
their Unkles, which the _Americans_ do not.

The Mourning for the Dead hath been an old Custom, and is not observ’d
by many People, but the time of a Moneth was not setled amongst them,
but was observ’d after a more unusual manner, seventy days, as in the
Fields of _Moab_ for _Moses_, and elsewhere for the Patriarch _Jacob_.
Lastly, all people know, that the _Romans_ and _Persians_ girt
themselves about with long Clothes. Besides, the _Jews_ were strictly
bound to observe Circumcision, without which they were not accounted
_Jews_, which the _Brasilians_ use not, as neither their Language or
Letters. How is it possible, that in _America_ they should at once have
forgotten their Extract, Laws, Circumcision, Language, and other
Ceremonies, when the rest of them observ’d nothing more strictly in all
parts of the Earth?

[Sidenote: _Grotius_ is of opinion that the _Americans_ belong’d to
           _Norway_.]

The Learned _Hugo Grotius_, in his Enquiry after the original of the
_Americans_, brings them with many Circumstances to belong to _Panama_,
situate opposite to the Northern Parts of _Norway_, because something of
their Languages agrees, and the Way thither easie and nearest to be
found: for first they travell’d from _Norway_ to _Ysland_, over which
the _Norwegians_ Rul’d above a thousand years since; so from _Ysland_
through _Friezland_ to _Groenland_, and from thence to _Estotiland_,
being a part of the Main Continent of _America_.

[Sidenote: This Opinion is largely contradicted.]

From _Friezland_ some Fishers went thither (as he says) two Centuries
before the _Spaniards_ touch’d that Shore; which _John de Laet_
contradicts. And indeed what Reasons can be given, Why the _Americans_
of the _Straights_, between _Panama_ and _Nombre de Dios_, lying
Northerly, should have another original than those that live to the
South, seeing the same _Straights_ are neither divided by Mountains nor
Rivers; and the _Spaniards_ found no alteration in the Customs and
Languages betwixt them that liv’d above or below these _Straights_. And
who will believe that _Norway_, which was but indifferently peopled,
could afford such numerous Colonies as could plant the Northern
_America_, which far exceeds the South, and chiefly, when the great
Islands that lie near the East and West, are added to it? Moreover it is
certain, (if the Yslander _Angrim Jonas_ is to be credited) that some
Families fled out of _Norway_ from their enraged King to _Ysland_ in the
Year 874. which at that time was but meanly inhabited.

[Sidenote: _Isaac Pontanus de Reb. Danicis._]

Forty years before, _Lewis_ the Just put the _Yslanders_ under the
protection of Pope _Gregory_ the fourth, who gave the Government of the
_Ysland_ Church to _Ansgar_ Archbishop of _Hamburgh_. But how comes it
that there is not the least spark of _Christianity_ found amongst the
Northern _Americans_, if they are deriv’d from the _Ysland Christians_?
and why did the _Yslanders_ remove to colder Countreys than _Groenland_
and _Friezland_, or their own native Soil, and for the most part not
inhabited?

Concerning _Groenland_ and _Friezland_, it is known by our _English_
Navigators, that they are joyn’d together, and both to the Northern
_America_; but not without vast Bays and Inlets, which betwixt
_Groenland_ and _America_ are obstructed with floating Castles of Ice;
so that the Passage is very dangerous. And full as troublesom, if not
altogether impossible, would the Journey be by Land, because the Earth
lies so thick cover’d with Ice and Snow, especially the Valleys, that no
Traveller is able to get through.

[Sidenote: The Voyage of two _Zeno_’s.]

[Sidenote: _Relatio Marc. Zenonis._]

Moreover, that which _Grotius_ says farther of the Fishers which first
discover’d _Estotiland_, is grounded on the Relation of the _Venetian_
Knights, _Nicholas_ and _Marcus Zeno_, two Brothers. _Anno 1380._
_Nicholas Zeno_ suffer’d Shipwrack on the _Friezland_ Coast; _Marcus_
inform’d thereof, steer’d his Course thither; fourteen years they spent
before they came to _Estotiland_: at last they return’d again to
_Friezland_, where _Nicholas_ died: But _Marcus_ returning home
publish’d his Journal, wherein he relates, That _Estotiland_ is above a
thousand Leagues distant from _Friezland_, and was discover’d by
_Friezland_ Fisher-men that were driven thither by Storm. But he hath
set down many things that have little resemblance of truth, according to
what is since found by credible Navigators; and therefore we cannot
depend on _Zeno_’s Discovery.

[Sidenote: The _American_ Tongue is nothing like the _Norwegian_.]

_John de Laet_ accounts it a great mistake in _Grotius_, that as a
testimony of the _Americans_ original out of _Norway_, he compares their
Languages. He reckons up some Places to be Northward of _Panama_, which
end their words with the syllable _Lan_ instead of _Land_, because the
_Spaniards_ have left out the Letter D at the end thereof. It is
certain, that in the Northern _America_ lie _Cimatlan_, _Coatlan_,
_Guescolan_, _Artlan_, _Quaxutatlan_, _Icatlan_, _Tapatlan_,
_Cinacatlan_, _Tenuchitlan_, _Comitlan_, _Metzitlan_, _Guatitlan_,
_Necotitlan_, _Curcatatlan_. Besides, that most of these Names are not
of Countreys, but of Towns and Villages, and therefore no ways fitting
to have the termination of _Land_: and it is well known that many
_American_ words end with _Lan_, which signifie nothing less than Land:
for the _Mexicans_ say _Puertatitlan_, which signifies _At the Gate
below_; _Ochachitlantzitlan_, _Yet lower_; _Tenoxtitlan_, (this City is
also call’d from her Founder _Mexis_, _Mexico_) that is, _Rests on a
Rock_. Moreover, it may not without reason seem strange to any, that the
Northern _Americans_ have remembred but three Cities out of all the
_Teutonick_ Tongue, _viz._ _Lan_ in stead _Land_.

[Sidenote: _Groenland_ when discovered.]

[Sidenote: _Serm. 3. Antiq. Danic._]

Concerning _Groenland_, through which the _Norwegians_ are thought to
have travell’d to _America_, _Lysander_ witnesseth, That it was
accidentally discover’d by one _Eric Rauder_, _Anno 987_, and planted
thirteen years after.

_Olaus_, King of _Norway_, plac’d two Bishops over the new Inhabitants,
as Substitutes to the Archbishop of _Dronthen_. For four Ages they
Sail’d frequently to _Groenland_; but since their King was impoverish’d
by War, they left off that Trade.

We find not in any Author, that the _Norwegians_ which liv’d along the
Sea-shore, ever went to seek a Way over the inaccessible Snowy Mountains
of _Groenland_, to this our _New World_.

Besides, _Grotius_ stands for the _Norwegians_ as Planters, upon
testimony of the _Mexicans_ themselves, who told the _Spaniards_, That
their Ancestors which planted there came from the _North_, first setling
themselves on _Estotiland_, where to this day there are not improbable
proofs by several remarks, that they were a _Norwegian_ Colony.

[Sidenote: The opinion concerning the City _Norumbega_ in _America_.]

In the _American_ City _Norumbega_, live a People that speak the same
Language, and observe the same Customs with the _Mexicans_.

In this by-Corner are found also some _Alavards_, or _Longobards_, or
_Lombards_, as they say. Now the _Spaniards_ call that _New Mexico_
because last discover’d, though indeed the old, cramm’d with People
eight hundred years since: for the _Mexicans_ of _New Mexico_ do not lie
so far Northerly, as to the North-west: for this _Mexico_ lies in sight
of _California_, which is believ’d to border on _Tartary_, or at least
separated from it by a narrow Channel. But _Norumbega_ (if ever such a
Place was) must, according to the _West-Indian_ Records, have been
situate where a part of _New France_ lies, now planted by the _English_:
between which and _New Mexico_ lies an almost unmeasurable vast Tract of
Land. Mean while here is not the least sign of this City _Norumbega_ to
be found: neither do the Inhabitants dwell in Cities, but live in Tents,
or moveable Villages, which change their Names as oft as their
Governors. Moreover, the _Norwegians_ could not get to this _Norumbega_
by Land through _Ysland_ and _Groenland_ to _Estotiland_, because of the
vast Bays, and great _Midland-Sea_, discover’d by the _English_ in their
North-western Discoveries; so that leaving _Estotiland_, it was
altogether impossible for them to come to _Norumbega_.

[Sidenote: _Chichimecen._]

Hereto may be added what the _Mexicans_ say of themselves, who
acknowledge, That travelling from the _North_, they did not find an
un-inhabited Countrey before them, but were forc’d to make their Way by
a long and bloody War with the _Chichimecen_, a salvage People, that
knew neither Laws or Religion.

The People also dwelling opposite to _California_, differ from the
Customs of the _Mexicans_, being divided into several People of contrary
Constitutions, and as different Languages.

[Sidenote: Customs and Constitutions of the _Mexicans_.]

_Grotius_ scrues up his Arguments from the likeness of the _American_
Speech and Customs with the _Norwegian_: for (says he) there is little
difference between _Pagod_ and _by-God_, or _like God_; _Guaira_ and
_Waeijer_, that is, _A Fan_; _Ilama_ and _Lam_, in _English_, _Lamb_;
_Peko_ and _Beke_, a _Brook_ or _Rivulet_. Both Customs and
Constitutions have also great resemblance. The _Mexicans_ relate, that
their Predecessors onely follow’d Hunting; that they divided and
reckon’d the Time, not by Days, but by Nights, and wash’d their Children
as soon as they were born in cold Water.

[Illustration]

They are so much inclin’d to Gaming, that they venture their Liberty at
it. Every one is satisfi’d with one Wife, except some of the Nobility,
which oftentimes have more. They throw up high Banks in several places
to damm out the Sea; believe the Immortality of the Soul; every one eats
at a peculiar Table; most of them go naked, onely cover their _Pudenda_
with a Cloth; some Sacrifice and eat Mans-flesh: all which, according to
_Tacitus_, _Pliny_, _Lucan_, and other _Roman_ Writers, was observ’d by
the antient _Germans_; from whom those that inhabit between the
_Norwegian_ Mountains were extracted.

These Allegations, to make the _Norwegians_ to be the Parents of the
Northern _Americans_, _John de Laet_ thus contradicts: “It no ways
follows that one People take original from the other, because here and
there are several words found, that have the same signification and
found in divers Countreys; much less when they must either add, change,
or diminish several Letters. Moreover, there is no small mistake in the
compar’d words: for _Pagod_ is not us’d all over _America_; the
_East-Indians_ about the River _Indus_, call their Idol-Temples _Pagod_,
or _Pagode_, the word _Guaira_ is no where us’d in _America_, but by the
_Peruvians_, and with them not signifying a _Fan_, but a little _Oven_;
neither is _Ilama_ a _Lamb_, (for before the coming of the _Spaniards_
thither, neither Sheep nor Lambs were ever seen in _Peru_) but a
Wool-bearing Beast, thus describ’d by _Joseph de Acosta_:

[Sidenote: A description of the strange Beast _Ilama_ in _Peru_.]

“_Ilama_ (says he) a four-footed Creature, furnishes its Master with
Meat and Clothing, and supplies the office of a Beast for Burthens, and
at no charge for Hay nor Provender, well satisfi’d with what he finds in
the Ways or Mountains. But the _Ilama_’s are of two sorts, either
woolly, or shorthair’d: the first go by the Name _Pacos_, the other
_Moromoro_, being not much less than a Calf, with a long Neck like a
Camel, but of several colours; for some are white, some black, and
others speckled, having an odd Look, especially when they are ty’d, and
stand still without any motion, staring with goggle-eyes on their
Owners: Sometimes in a moody humor, upon a sudden taking a freak, they
run up to the top of almost inaccessible Mountains, where both the
frantick Beast and his Burthen are lost. The _Pacos_ sometimes likewise
takes sudden Pets, and fustian Fits, often doing the forward
_Supersalt_, tumbling over and over with their Goods, and will not be
rais’d, their moodiness continuing, with beating, nay though they cut
them to pieces: but the best way is to sit down by them, and wait some
hours till their humor being spent they rise again of their own accords.
These Beasts are much inclin’d to a Disease call’d _Carashe_ or the
_Mange_, of which they generally die: and because the Disease is very
catching, they straight bury the infected alive, so the better to
preserve the rest.”

_Grotius_ also mistakes, when he compares the _Mexican Peke_ with the
_Dutch Beke_; for though many _Mexican_ Places, Mountains, and Rivers,
terminate in _Peke_, yet it signifies not a _Brook_ or _Rivulet_, for
that they call _Atlauhtli_.

[Sidenote: _De Orig. Gentium Americ._]

_John de Laet_ tells also, That with great diligence he found a
_Mexican_ Dictionary, Printed by the _Spaniards_ in _Mexico_, to find if
there were any words in it which agreed with any of those _European_
Languages that he understood, but found not one.

It is the same case with the Customs and Constitutions between the
_Norwegians_ and Northern _Americans_: for what concerns Hunting, how
many People have formerly liv’d by it? The antient _Germans_, and to
this day the _Tartars_ make it their whole business, excelling in that
Art all other Nations. Besides, that the more serious sort of the
_Mexicans_ many Ages since scorn’d to derive themselves from a Hunting
Ancestry, but affirm that they found the _Chichimecen_ in those
Countreys, who were great _Venators_.

[Sidenote: Customs of the _Americans._]

[Sidenote: Their Clothing.]

The accounting of Time by the Nights, extracted from the _Hebrews_, is
observ’d by divers Eastern People: and although the _Germans_ dipt and
wash’d their children in cold Rivers, or Brooks, so soon as they were
born, yet the _Mexicans_ never did it, but the Mother lays the Child on
the fourth day after its Birth, in an open place of the House, in the
middle whereof stands a Pot full of Water cover’d with Broom, in which
they wash the Infant. Neither are the _Americans_ so much addicted to
the Vice of Gaming as other Nations, so that _Grotius_ taxeth them too
severely as to that point: as on the contrary, he too much clears them
of Polygamy, whereas the _Mexicans_ Marry as many Wives as they please,
or are able to maintain. Father _Martyn Perez_ relates the same of the
_Cinaloans_, and other _Americans_; as also _Quarterius_ of the Natives
in _Nova Francia_, which lie nearest to _Norway_. And what need the
_Americans_ have the _Germans_ their Teachers, to make Dams and Banks
against Floods, since Nature and Necessity it self instructs it? and
where are any People so ignorant, as to ascribe the same event to Men
and Beasts after death? ’Tis true, their manner of eating in _America_
is several, because the People do not much converse together: but they
did not go naked; for the _Spaniards_ found them not onely neatly
Habited, but had a proper Name for every thing they wore. The
_Virginians_ us’d long Shirts; the _Floridans_ Skins of wild Beasts; and
towards the North they cover’d themselves from Head to Foot in hairy and
undress’d Hydes. The sacrificing of Men was in former Ages spreading far
and near over the World, and how far it was practis’d here, hath been
already declar’d at large. Lastly, all the _Americans_ are not guilty of
eating of Man’s-flesh, but that salvageness is confin’d to the Southern
_America_.

Thus much we have said, to prove that the _Norwegians_ had no hand in
planting the Northern _America_, we shall now proceed to enquire who
planted the Southern Parts, from the _Straights_ between _Panama_ and
_Nombre de Dios_, to the _Straights_ of _Magellan_.

The _Peruvians_, possessing a large Tract of Land along the Coast of the
_South-Sea_, _Grotius_ would thus derive from _China_:

[Sidenote: Relation of _Mancocapacus_.]

“The _Peruvians_, being of a subtile Wit, and quick of Apprehension,
argue sufficiently that they are not extracted from the more Northern
_Americans_, but rather from the _Chineses_, which the several Wrecks of
_Chinese_ Ships found on these Coasts sufficiently evidence: and no
wonder, if curiosity or accident brought the _Chineses_ expert
Navigators to this Countrey, separated onely by one Sea from them. To
this we may add their Rites of Religion; for both worship the Sun, and
call their King the Son of the Sun; they write no Letters but make
Characters downwards. _Mancocapacus_ was a _Chinese_ of strange Policy;
who being inform’d that his Countrey-men inhabited fruitful Countreys on
the other side of the _South-Sea_, but without Laws or Government,
Sail’d over thither, and gather’d the scatter’d Multitudes in a Body,
and establish’d an hereditary Kingdom after the _Chinese_ manner, to him
and his Successors.”

[Sidenote: The _Americans_ are not extracted from _China_.]

To which _John de Laet_ answers thus: “Though the _Peruvians_ exceed the
other _Americans_ in Policy, and at the arrival of the _Spaniards_ liv’d
in a handsom Order of Government, yet they can no ways be compar’d to
the sharp-witted, and noble-spirited _Chineses_; nay, there are in no
Place of _Peru_ found such Artificers as those of _China_, that bear the
praise of all the World; no where such manner of Buildings or Cities,
nor the least likeness of the _Chinese_ Curiosities. As concerning the
Wrecks found in _Peru_, I find no credible Author that gives an account
thereof: for certainly the _Chineses_ could much easier, and a nearer
way have come through the _Atlantick Sea_ to the Coasts of _America_,
lying to the East of _Peru_, than steer along the vast, and much greater
_South Sea_, and endure the horrible Storms and vast Waves, which the
_European_ Ships are scarce able to endure, much less the _Chinese_
Vessels, which are not so good. The _Spaniards_ which Sail yearly from
_Acupulco_ to the _Philippines_ are sensible of the great danger which
they endure, chiefly by the great gusts of Wind near _California_.
Besides, the _Peruvians_ before the arrival of the _Spaniards_, were
utterly ignorant of great Ships, and the use of Sails. How could they at
once have forgotten that Art, which they brought with them thither,
Moreover, it is easier to Sail from _Peru_ to _China_, than from _China_
to _Peru_, because the Winds under the Equinoctial Line commonly blow
Easterly. And it is the greater wonder, that the _Chinese_ Jonks
accidentally by Storm should be driven to _Peru_, because they were
never stor’d with Provisions but for a short Voyage, whereas this ask’d
nine Moneths. But if any one will suppose, that they purposely directed
their Course thither, how came the _Chineses_ to Sail just to _Peru_,
and not to _New Spain_, which is much closer to _China_? why were there
no Merchandises of the _Chineses_ found in _Peru_, since they went
thither for Trade? how came they to neglect that Navigation they had
once found? Nor is their Sun-worship (which was formerly practis’d in
most Parts of the World) of any validity to derive them from _China_?
But the contrary is most apparent, for the _Peruvians_ worship for their
chief God, _Viracocha_, that is, _God Almighty_, or _The Creator of all
things_.

“The _Chineses_, if Confutius an eye-witness may be credited, are
divided into three Sects of Religion: The first follow the Learn’d
_Trigantius_, and acknowledge a King of the Heavens, which must onely be
serv’d as the _Chineses_ sole Governor; to which purpose, two Temples
are built in the Royal Cities _Nankin_ and _Pekin_, one Consecrate to
Heaven, and the other to the Earth. The second Sect hath the name of
_Sciequia_, and serve the Idol _Omyto_. The third nam’d _Lanzu_, imploy
themselves in Magick and Exorcisms, Conjuring up, and laying
Evil-Spirits, whose horrid representations, when they have stuck upon
the Walls, they make an artificial and dreadful noise, as if Hell were
broke loose, and the House full of Devils; sometimes also force the
Evil-Spirits to enter into Images, from whence they receive no
impertinent answers to their questions: Therefore, who will compare this
Superstition of the _Peruvians_ worshipping of the Sun, to the _Chinese_
Religion, which do no such things?

[Sidenote: Embassy to the _Cham_, l. 2. c. 2.]

“The _Peruvians_ call’d their King, _A Lord of the Realm_, and not _The
Son of the Sun_, as in _China_: Though the _Mexicans_ otherwise worship
the Sun, and in their manner of adulation, styl’d _Hernando Cortez_,
their Conqueror, _Son of the Sun_: As to what concerns the manner of
writing, it is very well known, that the _Chineses_ words are all
Monosyllables, so that they have as many Letters as Words, which they
joyn so together, that they reckon eighty thousand, but with ten
thousand they are able to express themselves in most matters. These
Characters are contain’d in their _Halpien_ or Dictionary. The antient
_Chineses_ us’d seventeen several sorts of Characters in their writing,
some consisting of Serpents, that by several Wreathes and contortious
Windings, signify’d several things; others, of all sorts of agrestick
Tools belonging to Husbandry; some Characters of the Feathers of the
Bird _Fum-hoar_; others of Oysters and Worms, or of Roots, of Herbs, or
Birds Claws, or of Turtles, or of Herbs and Birds Feathers mingled, or
of Planets, and such like; but what manner of Writing or Hieroglyphick
of theirs resembles those, who by their own testimony know neither Pen,
Paper, Ink, nor any manner of Writing, but reckon the antiquity of time
by strung Beads, which was observ’d many ages since among several
Nations.”

[Sidenote: Original of the _Americans_ very obscure.]

[Sidenote: What we may believe concerning them.]

[Sidenote: The _Americans_ are derived from several people.]

Hitherto we have discover’d the several Opinions concerning the Original
of the _Americans_, or first Plantation of _America_, from all which,
having receiv’d no clear or demonstrative satisfaction, we must open our
way to a further scrutiny: But first, we must needs confess, that
contradiction is not difficult; but it is something of Work, when we
have beaten down a well-fortifi’d Opinion, to set up somewhat in stead
thereof, to stand a permanent and undeniable truth, which will be the
harder, in regard the Inhabitants of this new World have no old
Chronologies concerning their Antiquities, and first settling there; yet
if we cannot go so far absolutely to assert, yet some probabilities,
grounded (as we suppose) upon better reasons, may give more
satisfaction; for none will deny, but that the Generations of Mankind
being strangely multiply’d after the Flood, they then living five times
our Ages, and Wars not beginning till the known part of the Earth was
over-stock’d, justling for Territories, and some thrust quite out, at
last found _America_; which spreading it self to a vast extent, and now
found almost every where well inhabited, may be guess’d, that it was not
onely Planted from the first, but several times replenish’d since by
various Nations; Why may not several Planters, and at several times make
room for their Colonies, incroaching one upon another, either by force
or compact; as the _French_ themselves upon the _Gauls_, the _Normans_
upon them, the _Goths_ among the _Spaniards_, and the _Saxons_ among the
_Brittains_, and the _Normans_ again upon them?

Several people may easily Sail over thither, the _Azores_ or the
_Canary_ Isles lye so, that they are ready (as if design’d) for
Transportation to _America_; from whence _Acosta_ made a Voyage in
fifteen days. Also _Pliny_ gives us an account, that these Islands lay
uninhabited in his time; yet is it well known, that after _Pliny_’s
time, Ruins of Buildings were found there, signifying, they had been
formerly Planted; and why might not those ancient Inhabitants Sail
thence to the neighboring _America_?

[Sidenote: _Marian. de Reb. Hisp._ l. 1. c. 18.]

_Tercera_ lying half way between _Spain_ and _America_, was frequented
by Navigators before the Birth of our Savior; and it seems as easie to
Sail from thence to _America_, as from the Main Land of _Spain_ thither:
Add this, that necessity forc’d the _Spaniards_ to look about them from
other Countreys, for since they lost their Victorious Champion _Baucius
Gapetus_, they were every where beaten, being tired out by the
_Phenician_ Forces, and that oppression over, suffer’d as much under the
_Roman_ Yoke: Wherefore it seems not strange, if a considerable number
remov’d from thence, that they might live some where else in quiet; for
which purpose they wanted no conveniencies to Rig and set forth stout
and sufficient Vessels, able to live in those Seas, having had long
experience from the _Phenician_ Voyagers, whose Fleets Sail’d daily to
and again in several Expeditions, from _Cadiz_ and _Gibraltar_ towards
these Western Countreys: Nay, _Hanno_ himself their first Navigator that
way, who gives an account of the _Gorgons_, or the Isles of _Cape Verd_,
a good part of the way to _America_.

[Sidenote: _English_ famous Sea-men.]

[Sidenote: _Barat-anac_, or, _Tinland_, the _Phenician_ name, and
           _Brittania_ the _Greek_ name of _Brittain_.]

And though _Brittain_, _Ireland_, and the _Brittish Orcades_ lay further
from _America_, yet something may be said particularly to prove, That
many Ages since, Expeditions had been made from thence to the New World;
and that the Inhabitants of these our Isles, in former Ages, were
peculiarly famous for their skill in Navigation; insomuch, that the
_Cretans_ and _Phenicians_ emulous of their skill, and jealous of their
danger, made several Attacques and Invasions upon these Isles, which is
the more probable, many remarks of the _Phenician_ and _Greek_ Language,
remaining in the denominations of the Countrey: Of which, take first
this account:

[Sidenote: Old Voyage of _Madok_ to _America_; for which see _Vet. Hist.
           Brit._]

_Anno 1170._ When _Owen Guyneth_, Prince of _Wales_, having Raign’d long
and happily in his setled Dominions, dying, left several Sons, who
quarrelling, their elder Brother, as not contented with their shares of
the Principality, nor to be under him, having gotten no mean Interests
and Claims to the whole by their struglings, so weakned one another,
that they open’d a way to the loosing of all.

[Sidenote: _David Powel in Historia Cambriæ._]

Amongst these Brothers, _Madok_, a Prince of a milder disposition, weary
of such unnatural Dissentions, threw up his share, better contented to
seek new Fortunes abroad; whereupon there were many soon perswaded to
venture their lives with him, where ever he would please to Transport:
So Rigging a small Fleet, he Sail’d Westward, far beyond _Ireland_,
where at last he discover’d an unknown and un-inhabited Countrey, but
wondrous pleasant, the Air being temperate, and the Soyl most fertile:
Glad of this good success (as the Story says) he returning, spreading
the Fame of this his New-Found-Land, which they might exchange for a
barren Soyl, hatter’d and harass’d with an endless Civil-War.

No small number flock’d to these Summons, as a most acceptable
Undertaking; so that soon after he was able to send forth ten good
Ships, Freighted only with Men, Women, and Children, and all other
Materials fit for a new Plantation; which not long after Landed in
_Acuzamil_, a Countrey in the North of _America_, as _Francis Lopez de
Gomara_ believes, because there he onely found some remaining Tracks of
Christianity, a People that worshipp’d the Cross, but knew no reason why
or wherefore they ador’d that sign of our Redemption. Now, some will
say, that this Worship of the Cross is no argument to prove, that the
_Brittish_ Christians first Planted in the North of _America_; but what
will not time and change of place do, where Transplanted People keep no
Records, so they forget not onely Religion, Laws, and Customs, but who
they were, and from whence they came, Oblivion first mutilating, and at
last swallowing up all; of which, take this one late president.

[Sidenote: Strange occasion of _De la Roche_.]

_Anno 1598._ The Duke _De La Roche_ obtain’d leave of the _French_ King,
to transport a Colony of Volunteers to _New France_; in his way he
Landed fifty Men on the Island _De Sable_, to rest his Passengers, and
that he might the better, and with more ease explore the Countrey, and
when resolv’d where to settle, then to fetch them off; who accordingly,
as design’d, soon after, returning thither, was met with so violent a
Storm, that not being able to Weather the Isle of _Sable_, where he left
his People, he lost his whole Expedition, and was driven back to a
_French_ Harbor, where no sooner arriv’d, he was so highly charg’d, that
he was cast into Prison, when those he had left neglected upon the Isle,
were not once so much as thought of; in this interim, they never
expecting to hear more of their Captain, liv’d in a wild and miserable
condition, feeding upon Fish, and sometimes wild Swine, without Bread,
Drink, or Salt.

When the Baron of _Leri_ went with Letters Patents, to be Governor of
_Nova Francia_, and by stress of Weather in his Voyage, was forc’d to
put in at _Sable_, where he found the remainder of _La Roches_ People,
who being from fifty reduced to twelve, having clad themselves in
Sea-Wolves Skins, they had not onely lost their former _French_
Civilities, but forgot in a manner their Religion, much of their
Language, and what they were, being as if Metamorphos’d into bestial
Salvages.

[Sidenote: If some did not come accidentally to _America_.]

And although we have already controverted the improbability of Peopling
_America_, either by accident of Storm, or set purpose; yet it may be
possible that so it might happen, for as the several vertues of Plants,
Herbs, Precious-Stones, and Minerals, though strangely occult, and so
altogether unknown, that what could never be found by Art, meer chance
hath brought to light, and their wondrous qualities, some casual
accident hath made apparent; so strange and remote Countreys never to be
found in our Charts, or Maps, nor Registred in any Story, Seamen bound
to their intended Harbors, have stumbled on by chance, either
Hood-wink’d by blind Mists, or forc’d upon by pertinatious Weather; of
which _America_ may be her own witness, for how was _Columbus_ stirr’d
up, but by incitations of the Journals of a Sea-Captain, dying in his
House, driven on the _American_ Islands by foul Weather.

[Sidenote: _America_ was Peopled presently after the Flood.]

[Sidenote: Giants in _America_.]

[Sidenote: _Conjurati fratres_, _Virg. Georg._]

[Sidenote: The Flood acknowledg’d there.]

Although from the foremention’d places, and after the same manner,
_America_ might be furnish’d with Inhabitants; so it also gives us a
more certain assurance, that the Planting of _America_ was not onely
soon after the Flood, but that they came also thither by Land: And how
strangely would it be against the Majesty and Wisdom of Divine
Providence, to leave half the Universal Globe, a World fully supply’d
with all sorts of Creatures, fit for Food and Service, Plants, Herbs,
and the richest Minerals, like a House new built, and well furnish’d,
without a Master or any Inhabitant, _viz._ Man, who being of Celestial
Extract, should be able to acknowledge and glorifie the Creator, by
admiring the Creature in his great Works: Besides, the confus’d Notions
and Fables of Giants, Perpetrators of all manner of Crimes, and
wallowing in all kind of sensual Debaucheries, are always remembred
among the Antiquities of the _Americans_, and that they had some slender
hints of antient Truth, not onely of the Giants before the Flood, but of
those that soon after the rank fatness of the Earth, produc’d and fed to
that pitch of Arrogance, that the covenanting Brethren defi’d God,
fortifying themselves to fight him by the advantage of that their long
congested Pile, _Babel_, which in a short time was transverted by the
_Heathen_ Poets into their _Gigantomachia_, heaping Hills on Hills, like
the _American_ Traditions: From which we may conjecture, that they came
thither in the time of _Noah_; for why may not any believe, when _Noah_
liv’d three hundred years after he Landed on Mount _Ararat_, that he
took care to People the World? And who will make him ignorant of this
New World, who living five hundred years before, might not improbably by
his own industry and the help of the former long-liv’d _Patriarchs_,
been well able to make a general Survey of the Old; and he could better
furnish _America_, it being nearer Mount _Ararat_, than supply _Italy_,
_Spain_, _Germany_, or any Northern Territories in _Europe_, so that
_America_ might be known to the first people after the Flood, nay,
inhabited by them, though since that, the knowledge was lost.

_Pliny_ complaining of the Supine negligence, and stupendious sloth
which reign’d then and long before as he had observ’d, among all people,
and in every place, who were so far from making inquiry after
discoveries of Lands for new Plantations, that they lost the old, when
they had begun to settle, though under the greatest serenity of Peace;
The Sea by that means lying open beyond what any juncture of former
times could be proud of.

[Sidenote: _Canary Islands_, by whom discover’d.]

[Sidenote: _Hesperian_ Gardens, what they signifie.]

Yet the _Fortunate_, or _Canary_ Islands were in the first ages after
_Noah_, frequented with Vessels, which in later times were altogether
neglected, till _Guillaum Betancourt_, a Gentleman of _Picardye_,
brought them again to be taken notice of by a fresh Trade. The Fable of
the _Hesperian_ Gardens, and the Dragon that kept the Golden Fruit, with
constant Vigils, is nothing but an allusion to the Sea, which with
Serpentine Embraces, not onely secur’d these scatter’d Isles, but
swallow’d up several Adventurers that too hardy made their unhappy
approaches for discovery.

Another Allegation for the Planting of _America_ by Land, both whose
sides are wash’d on the East and West, by the South and Atlantick Ocean,
may be thus probably made out: The Atlantick rowls over with almost
Fathomless Waters, three thousand Leagues of Ground; the South-Sea not
much less, which well may be, being indeed but one continu’d Sea,
encompassing, till meeting there, the Universal Ball; whence springs a
more likelyhood, that _America_ might be Planted from the Southern
parts, from the _Straights_ of _Magellan_, and _Le-Mayr_.

[Sidenote: _Relatio de Terra Australe._]

[Sidenote: The Description of the unknown South.]

_Peter Fernandes de Quir_ relates, That he and a Commander, _Lodowick
Paes le Torres_ saw a part of the South Countrey, and in it innumerable
Inhabitants, _Whites_, _Blacks_, _Sallows_, with long, black, curl’d,
Woolly, and yellow Hair. They know no Walls or Fortresses for Defence,
Laws or Kings, but are divided into Tribes: They use indeed Bows,
Arrows, Clubs, and a kind of Spears: Their Houses are cover’d with
Palm-Tree-Leaves; their Housholdstuff consists onely of a few Earthen
Pots, and such Trinkets; yet they have some little skill in Weaving, and
though they go naked, pride themselves in Neck-Laces and Bracelets, made
of Mother of Pearl: But these for their Complexions and Constitution of
Body, Customs, and manners, are rather deriv’d from the _Americans_,
than they from them, and therefore we must seek for their Original from
the North; from which are but two ways, one from _Ysland_ and
_Groenland_, which _Grotius_ endeavors to prove, but contradicted; the
other out of _Tartary_, which certainly was the first Nursery, from
whence the _Americans_ were Transplanted.

[Sidenote: Description of _Tartary_.]

_Tartary_ or _Tattary_, so call’d from the River _Tatter_, which runs
thorow the Countrey _Mongul_ into the Northern Ocean, covers a great
part of the Terrestrial Globe; the lesser _Tartary_ makes out a
considerable part of _Europe_; the greater is _Asia_.

This great _Tartary_, which is a thousand Leagues long, and six hundred
broad, reckons five chief Provinces, _viz._ the wild _Tartary_,
inhabited by Herdsmen; _Sagatai_, of which the Metropolis is
_Samarcand_, famous for the mighty _Tamerlane_; next _Turkestan_; then
_Kitai_, which the great _Cham_ Commands; and lastly, _Old Tartary_,
according to _Andreas Cæsariensis_, the habitation of _Gog_ and _Magog_.

Now we must enquire from what _Tartars_ the _Americans_ are Extracted:

[Sidenote: _Thrian_ l. 67.]

[Sidenote: If the _Israelites_ were _Tartars_.]

_Mornæus_, _Postellus_, _Genebrardus_, _Poterus_, and others are of
opinion, That the _Tartars_, which about the year 1228. under the
Command of _Zingis Cham_ overspread the Earth like a deluge, were the
Successors of the ten Tribes of _Israel_, which were carry’d into
captivity to _Assyria_ by _Salmanazar_. The name _Tartary_, or rather
_Tattaria_, seems to be some testimony thereof, because it signifies in
the _Syrian_ or _Hebrew_ Tongue, _Remnants_ or _Remainders_, as
seemingly, because these _Tartarians_ were remainders of the
foremention’d Tribes; nay, the Northern _Tartary_ Herdsmen preserve to
this day the Names _Dan_, _Zabulon_, and _Naphthali_: Wherefore we need
not to admire, why so many _Jews_ are found in _Russia_, _Sarmatia_, and
_Liefland_; nay, the nearer to _Tartary_, the more _Jews_ there are.

Circumcision hath a long time been observ’d among them, before _Mahomet_
brought in his new Law; it seems, that _Mahomet_ order’d the
Circumcision and other Laws, according to _Moses_, to be observ’d by the
Northern people, because that in his time, they began to Rebel, that so
they might the better be kept in awe by their new Religion.

[Sidenote: _Pand. Hist. Turcica._]

_Joannes Leonclavius_ relates, That in _Liefland_ near _Riga_, he heard
the wilde Natives call’d _Letti_, not without great admiration, go
crying along the High-Ways and Fields, with a doleful voice, _Jeru,
Jeru, Masco lou_: It is believ’d that they mourn for _Jerusalem_ and
_Damascus_; but by their long continuance in the vast Wildernesses, they
have forgot their Religion and Laws, and what else might enable to tell
us who they were. Several learned Authors question this removal of the
_Israelites_ out of _Assyria_ to _Tartary_, though to our Judgement
their Arguments are too weak, to take from them of the footing they have
gotten there; yet nevertheless, the _Israelites_ are not to be taken for
the Planters of _America_, for why else is not _Judaisme_ as well found
in _America_ as in _Tartary_. But it is already shewn, that _America_
was inhabited long before the dispersion of the _Israelites_.

[Sidenote: _Americans_ are not deriv’d from _Africa_ nor _Europe_.]

[Sidenote: But _Asia_, and chiefly out of _Tartary_.]

Now to shut up all, it is evident, that the first Planters of _America_
were not _Europeans_ from the dissimilitude of the People, both in their
Complexions, Language and Persons; nor _Africans_, because that in all
the far-spreading Countrey of _America_, not one _Negro_ is to be found,
except a few near the River _Martha_, in the little Territory
_Quarequa_, which must by Storm be drove thither from the _Guinny_
Coast: So that _Asia_, the Mother of all People, onely remains to be
Implanter of our _America_, whose Western Coast, opposite to _Asia_, is
more inhabited than to the East, where it respects _Europe_.

[Sidenote: _Tartary_ is not parted from _America_ by the _Straights_ of
           _Anian_.]

Moreover, _Armenia_, out of which, by _Noah_’s Progeny, the whole Earth
was re-peopled, borders on _Scythia_, now call’d _Tartary_, and
_Tartary_ faces _America_, separated onely by the _Straights_ of
_Anian_; though some are of opinion, that out of the South into the
Frozen Sea, there is no passage thorow these _Straights_, else (as we
have already prov’d the contrary) how came all those Voracious and
Poysonous Beasts into _America_, if it be clearly separated from _Asia_
by Sea?

It deserves here to be related, what happen’d to _Henry Cornelison
Schaep_, and _William Byleveld_, Sailing from _Batavia_ to discover the
_Tartarick_ River _Polysange_, but were taken and carry’d Prisoners to
the _Japan_ Court at _Jedo_; being Commanded there by Order of the
Councel to give an account of a _Japan_ Map or Card, which was laid
before them, and contain’d the Provinces of _Japan_, _Amboina_, the
_Molucca_ Islands, _Manilha_, the _South-Sea_, _Borneo_, _Celebes_,
_Malacca_, _Tartary_, _Formosa_, _Corea_, and the vast and Mountainous
Countrey or Desart of _Jesso_, separated from _Japan_ by the _Straights_
of _Sungar_; though toward the North, it joyns to _Japan_ in the
Province of _Ochio_; and beginning in forty seven degrees, run
North-East towards _America_, but they could not possible find the
_Straights_ of _Anian_; but on the contrary, the Promontory of
_Tartary_, _viz._ the Province _Kataya_ or _Katui_ lay in the same
parallel with the Northern _America_.

[Sidenote: _Ennead_ 9. l. 6. Testimonies that the _Americans_ are
           _Tartars_.]

Hereto may be added, that _Asia_ hath no Territory any where, which may
more easily with numerous Colonies supply _America_ than this part of
_Tartary_, as well for the vastness of the Countrey, to which no other
can compare, as for the increasing of the Inhabitants: Who doth not
admire, that according to _Michalon Lithouwer_, there is scarce a City
in _Tartary_ that boasted less than a thousand Temples? and to see
_Canguista_ first King of _Tartary_, about the Year 1200. in Arms; and
his Successor _Hoccata_ following his Fathers bloody Footsteps, whilst
he prepar’d his Sons with three vast Armies? The eldest Son, _Jachis_,
March’d Westward with thirty thousand Horse; _Batho_ drew with as great
an Army towards the North; _Tagladais_ being the youngest fell into the
_Moores_ Countrey above _Egypt_. _Hoccata_ himself March’d victoriously
into the North _America_, subdu’d great part of the _Persian_ Kingdom,
and beat the _Turks_, led by the General _Goniata_ with a great Army,
_Anno 1241._ as _Jacob Planensis_ and _Benedictus Sarmata_, two _Monks_,
sent by Pope _Innocent_ to _Hoccata_, witness: The great number of the
_Tartars_ or _Scythians_, may appear by the several people, spread far
and near over _Tartary_; _Pliny_ reckons some of them, _viz._
_Auchetes_, _Neuri_, _Geloni_, _Thussagetes_, _Budini_, _Basilides_,
_Agathyrsi_, _Nomades_, _Anthropophagi_, _Hyperborei_, _Arimphei_,
_Cimmerij_, _Cicianthi_, _Georgi_, _Sacores_, and others: What number
would the Inhabitants make up that live in _America_, in _Teneneuf_,
_Virginia_, _Florida_, _New Spain_, _Guadalaiara_, _Guatemala_, _Terra
firma_, _New Granada_, _Peru_, _Chili_, _Rio de la Plata_, _Brasil_,
_Guaiana_, _New Andaluzai_?

It will be worth our time, to compare the likeness between the
_Scythians_ and Northern _Americans_; both of them are differenc’d with
special Marks of a more than ordinary and natural distance between the
Eyes, which much alters the whole Air of the Face, and the plumpness and
swelling of their Cheeks summits above the Cheek-bone; most of these are
of a middle stature, having downy Hair upon their Chin, like the Callow
Feathers of an unfledg’d Bird. Lastly, as the _Tartars_, they differ
amongst themselves in their Customs, yet in several things they agree
one with another, according as they are govern’d by others, and yet
other Princes, some powerful, and some weaker, according as every ones
power be more or less. The Inhabitants of _Lucaja_ bear so great a
respect, and stand so much in awe of their Governor, that if commanded
to leap from a Rock, and break their Necks, they instantly obey.

The same is observ’d by the _Tartars_; the first King _Canguista_
Commanded the seven Princes of his Realm to Murder their Sons with their
own Hands, which they all readily perform’d.

[Sidenote: Constitutions of the _Tartars_ and _Americans_ agree.]

In _Popaina_ they live to this day like some _Tartars_, without Laws or
Law-givers, who change their places by turns, from the great increase of
the _Tartars_, the _Americans_ no ways differ.

_Bartholomeus de las Casas_ writ to _Charles the Fifth_, That the
_Spaniards_ in few years, onely on the Islands _Cuba_, _Hispaniola_,
_Naco_, _Hondures_, in _Venezuela_ and _New Spain_, destroy’d above
2600000. Men, besides the slaughter that was made in _Peru_, _Brasil_,
_Rio de la Plata_ and other places, which far exceed the foremention’d
numbers.

Polygamy is still in use, both among the _Tartars_ and _Americans_; both
acknowledge the Immortality of the Soul, both like _Cannibals_, Eating
and Sacrificing Mans flesh. How famous amongst the Antients was the
Altar of _Diana_ in _Taurica Chersonesus_, where several Men were daily
Sacrificed? How delicate, according to _Sabellicus_, did the _Tartars_
account their Dishes, Sauc’d and serv’d with humane Gore?

[Sidenote: _Geogr._ l. 11 q. 7.]

_Strabo_ relates, That the antient People account it an honourable Death
to be chop’d in pieces, and their flesh serv’d up in Commons. Those that
die by Age, a natural death, are despis’d like Malefactors, and as a
punishment according to their Demerits, left in the open Fields, a prey
to Birds and Beasts; some delight in that loathsome gorging themselves
with Mens flesh, others on the contrary, not onely detest humane, but
all manner of flesh: And just so the _Americans_ are distinguish’d, for
although the _Caribes_, _Brasilians_, the Inhabitants of _New Spain_,
_New Granada_, _St. Martha_, and others, Sacrifice and eat Men, yet as
many abhor and detest that odious Diet and abominable Custom.

_Giles Flesher_ Queen _Elisabeths_ Agent in _Muscow_ relates, That _Anno
1588._ _Kinach Morsey_, Grandson to the Governor of the _Chrim Tartars_,
made his entrance there with a Retinue of three hundred Noblemen, and
two Ladies, of which one was the Widow of his deceased Brother. The
great Prince inform’d of their coming, sent him two slaughter’d Horses,
whose sides and Hanches they feasted on, as we on Fallow Deer.

[Sidenote: Devil-worship in _Americ_.]

Most of the _Tartars_ use no manner of Letters or Characters; in the
Voyage made into _Persia_, they first learn’d to make Letters; just so
it is in _America_; their bemoaning of the dead ends in one Moneth, both
by the _Tartars_ and _Americans_; with a Person of Quality, the
_Tartars_ bury a live Servant; the same Custom is observ’d by some of
the _Americans_; and so much do they agree in a salvage and rude life,
that Merchandizing and Mechanicks are little regarded. _Ayson_ the
_American_ acknowledges the _Tartars_ for a rude People in their
Religion, Habits, and Dwellings, and yet in all these the _Americans_
differ but very little. Lastly, How common is it amongst them to worship
the Devil? Along the River _Sagadahoc_, the Inhabitants are every new
Moon miserably tormented by an Evil Spirit call’d _Tanto_. In the
Temples in _Virginia_ remain yet the horrible Images of the Devils _Oka_
and _Menetto_. Not a House in _Mexico_, but hath a peculiar Chappel, set
apart for this their suppos’d holy, but damnable Adoration of the Devil.
Others in _Virginia_ believe, That there is a great and supreme Deity,
which is Everlasting, and for ever. The _Tartars_ also are of the like
perswasion.

[Sidenote: _Tartarian_ Horses.]

But this Opinion _Grotius_ hath laid a strong and dangerous Battery
against, that _America_ could not be Peopled by the _Tartars_, because
the _Americans_ before the _Spaniards_ coming thither, had never seen
any Horses; whereas the _Tartars_ use no Beast more, either in Peace or
War, nor can less want: For the _Tartarian_ Forces do not only consist
in Horse; but the Wealth of this Countrey is reckon’d up in the numerous
Breeds of Horses, and several Studs of Mares. Some of the Nobless keep a
thousand Horse; none, though never so poor, but keep two or three; and
Beggars there mounted crave Alms and Charity of the People. When they
remove their Habitations, their Horses carry their Provisions and Tents:
If Provisions grow short, they eat Mares Milk, high gusted with Garlick,
which satisfies Hunger and Thirst; and the red Liquor which they tap
warm from their Veins, serves them to help Digestion, and heighten their
Humor, instead of the Blood of the Grape, our sweet Wine. The swiftest
Rivers, though raging and precipitated with Land-floods, they dare
adventure swimming their Horses over, hanging naked by their Manes, and
guiding them by a slipp’d Rein whither they please: To their Tails they
tie their Saddles, and other Necessaries, bound up in Rushes. When a
Person of Quality prepares to cross any River, they tie two Horses Tail
to Tail, and athwart both their Backs fasten a Mat pleited of Rushes, to
sit on. When they are stopp’d at any broad River, or standing Lake, they
kill and flea their worst Horses; then turning the Skins inside out, and
well Liquoring, they stretch them open with the Ribs, which stand like
the Bayles of a Tilted Wherry, and thus furnish’d, serves them for a
Boat to carry eight Persons. When they take the Field, going to War, not
any but musters three Horses; which makes their Armies, when drawn out
in Campain, shew much bigger than indeed they are: And though many of
them are kill’d in the Wars, or slain for Food, yet the _European
Tartars_ pay yearly forty thousand Horses to the _Russians_; from whence
_Grotius_ thus argues, “If _America_ joyns to _Tartary_, then the Horses
which run wild at Grass might easily have found _America_ themselves,
seeking to improve their Pasture, and have gone from one Countrey into
the other, as it appears, that since the _Spaniards_ transported Horses
to _America_, they are dispers’d over the highest Mountains, out of one
Province into the other: Or if the _Straights of Anian_ run between
both, the _Tartars_ never were Navigators; and suppose they had been,
they would not have cross’d without Horses, without which they knew not
how to subsist.” To which we only say thus, That although _Tartary_ now,
and in former times, abounded in Horse, yet must we grant, that it hath
been always so? or that the ancient _Scythians_, who we avouch first
planted _America_, had such frequent use of them as the _Tartars_ now.
This may be controverted, for that these _Scythians_ planting there in
the Non-age of Time, presently after the Flood, the use of Horses was
unknown, which the Ancient Poets testifie by their Fiction of
_Centaurs_, who when first seen, the Horse and Rider were taken for one
Creature. The like mistake the _Mexicans_ had, when they saw the mounted
_Spaniards_, a thousand running away from one Cavalier.

As to their coming thither of themselves, it may easily be confuted: Who
knows not, that there is no Countrey a continu’d Pasture, but luxurious
Vales separated with inaccessible Mountains, Lakes, and vast
Wildernesses. But _David Ingram_ relates, “That he saw some Horses in
the Northern _America_, which the _Mexicans_, and other Conquests of the
_Spaniards_ never heard of:” Whereupon we may conclude, and we suppose
without all peradventure, That the _Americans_ have absolutely their
Original from _Tartary_, which bordering _Armenia_, where _Noah_’s Ark
first rested, hath a convenient way, though beyond the _Artick Circle_,
through a temperate Climate betwixt Heat and Cold, to _Cathay_, in the
same Parallel with the neighboring _America_.

 _First Discoverers of_ America. Christopher Colonus _his Expedition_.


[Sidenote: _Pet Bizari Res Genoan._ lib. 16.]

[Sidenote: _Lib. 11. Hist. Georg._]

[Sidenote: _Christoph. Colonus_’s Birth.]

_Christopher Colonus_, generally (though by mistake) call’d _Columbus_,
was born in _Arbizolo_, a Village in the Dominion of _Genoa_, near
_Savona_; his Father liv’d by Fishing in the Midland-Sea: So that
_Sebastian Schroter_, and others besides him, are mistaken, saying,
_Colonus_ was born in the City _Cucureum_, and descended of the Noble
Family _Pilistrelli_: For _Peter Bezarus_, _Colonus_ his Countrey-man,
gives unquestionable Proofs of his mean Extract; and amongst other
things, That the Common-wealth of _Genoa_ refus’d to receive the great
Legacy which _Colonus_ left them in his Will, because they fondly
thought it a derogation to their Honor, being so great a Republick, to
take any thing of Bequest from a Fishers Son: Yet his Majesty of
_Castile_ thought otherwise, not onely enriching him with Wealth, and a
fair Revenue for his Discovery of the _West-Indies_; but also, though of
a low derivation, rais’d him to great Honor, Ennobling him the first of
his Family with Dignities, Titles, and Escutcheon, which rank’d him in
place among his Prime Nobility.

[Sidenote: Discovers _Hispaniola_.]

[Sidenote: Trades with the Natives.]

_Colonus_, whom we shall henceforth call _Columbus_, spent his Youth
near the Sea, where he was busie exploring the Winds, considering their
Natures, and the Quarters whence they rose, especially with the setting
of the Current from the _Atlantick_ to the _Mediterrane_. The Western
Winds, which often, as well as the _Levant_, blow several days together
from the great Ocean, much amusing him, hinted at last some Notions,
that there might be another World, and new Places to be discover’d,
beyond the setting of the Sun; and that the _Ne plus ultra_ should not
be, if he could help it, the commanding Terminary of the Earth that way.
He also spent much time, being of a solid Judgment, in the Emendations
of Charts and Maps, then very much improvable: And the _Portuguese_, who
at that time had got the start in Navigation from all other People,
being then busie to find a way by the South of _Africa_ to the
_East-Indies_, not contented to go by hearsay, he went himself in Person
a Voyage with them. Soon after _Columbus_ settled himself in the Island
_Madera_, where an Accident hapned, which _Francis Lopez de Gomesa_
relates thus: “The Master of a Ship, whose Name and Countrey lies buried
in Oblivion (though some would have him to be of _Spain_, some an
_Andalusian_ or _Biscayner_, and others a _Portuguese_) Trading the
_Canaries_ and _Flemmish-Isles_, was surpris’d by a hideous Tempest from
the East, which hurried him _nolens volens_ through dreadful Waves,
where at last he found himself ingag’d upon a Western Coast, altogether
unknown. The Storm ceasing, without making further Discoveries, he
pick’d his way homeward, at last Landing in the Haven of _Madera_: All
his Crew but three and himself, with hardship, want, and the long Voyage
having perish’d, himself dangerously sick, was carried into _Columbus_
his House; where lying on his Death-Bed, he bequeath’d to _Columbus_ his
Maps, Journals, and other Observations of this his unfortunate Voyage.”
_Columbus_ being by these Papers more confirm’d than ever in his Opinion
of a New World in the West, declar’d what he verily believ’d, to the
States of _Genoa_; but they look’d upon him as a vain and idle Fellow;
yet _Columbus_ full of his great Project, thus slighted and scornfully
rejected, sate not so down, but address’d himself to the King of
_Portugal_, where they wearied him, spending long time with dilatory
Answers, to no effect; the Opinion of a whole Court of expert Navigators
having cast his Declaration out, as a _Chimera_ or meer Fancy. Soon
after _Columbus_ sending his Brother into _England_, to move the
Business to King _Henry_ the Seventh, he being taken Prisoner by the
way, and lying long er’e his Release, came too late to the _English_
Court, prevented by the News of _Christopher_’s return with Success from
his intended Voyage: For mean while _Ferdinando_ and _Isabella_ King of
_Castile_, having finish’d his Wars with the _Moors_, had furnish’d him
out for the Expedition; which he effected by the favor of _Alfonso
Mendotio_ and _Alfonso Quintavilia_, both great Ministers of State under
_Ferdinand_ and _Isabel_, and obtain’d so much at last, that he was sent
with a hundred and twenty Souldiers, besides Sea-men, in two Ships, and
one Pinnace. Thus supplied, he set Sail from _Cadiz_ upon the Kings
account the fourth of _August, Anno 1492._ and first reach’d the
_Canary-Islands_, and from thence steering South-West, the Wind in
thirty three days scarce varying one Point: But though the Weather blew
so constant, yet the Sea-men chang’d their Minds, and Storm’d quite
contrary, crying, That _Columbus_ was guilty of all their Deaths: _For_
(said they, after they had lost sight of the _Canaries_ so many days,
nothing appearing but Sea and Sky) _Who can hope for any Success or
happy conclusion of so desperate a Voyage, so rashly undertaken, and
found now so full of eminent danger?_ Yet _Columbus_ bore bravely up,
and weather’d all their Exclamations, although they threatned no less
than his Murder: At last Articling, they came to this Agreement, _That
if after sailing forwards three days more, no Land were discover’d, they
should return_: But about two a Clock the next Night, _Columbus_ saw a
glimmering like Fire in the Sky, and in the Morning found himself close
aboard a most pleasant Coast, where Landing with twelve Men, he erected
a Cross cut out of a Tree. Thence he sail’d over to _Cuba_, where the
Sea was so rough, that he was forc’d to stand off, fearing Rocks and
Shallow Water. Soon after he got to the Northward of the Island
_Haytin_, which he call’d _Hispaniola_: Here his best Ship was bulged
upon a Rock, on which they had all perish’d, had it not been flat on the
top, so that the Soldiers and the whole Crew of Sea-men were sav’d by
the two Vessels. The Inhabitants stark naked, seeing these Strangers,
fled to the Woods; but the _Spaniards_ overtaking a Woman, they
entertain’d her with Sweet-meats and _Spanish_ Wine, and putting her on
a white Shirt, sent her again to the rest of the Natives, where
return’d, she told what good Entertainment she had had to her
Companions; whereupon divers of the Islanders came aboard of the
_Spaniards_, in Boats made of one piece of Wood, where they barter’d
Gold for Beads, pieces of Glass, Knives, Shells, and other Trifles. The
King of _Guaccanarillo_ gave testimony of peculiar inclination to the
_Spaniards_, helping them to Fish up the remaining Goods of the Wreck,
and inform’d them, That some Rivers flowing from the tops of high
Mountains, wash’d down the Gold amongst the Sand: notwithstanding a
strange Prophecy had been told to these Islanders, namely, _That Bearded
Men out of remote Countries should destroy their Goods, take their Land,
and massacre their Children_. He also told them what made them fly, and
betake them to their Heels at the arrival of the _Spaniards_, because
they were oftentimes surpris’d by the _Cannibals_, who snatch’d up all
they could lay hold on: Their Boys and Striplings they gelded, cooping
and cramming them up, as we our Capons, for Feasts: The young and
well-grown Men they chopp’d to pieces, salted, and Barrel’d up: Young
Women they preserv’d for breed, and old ones they made Slaves. These
_Cannibals_ were so terrible to the Inhabitants of _Haytin_, that a
thousand of them durst not venture to engage against ten, but would run
every way, dispers’d like Flocks of Sheep before the Wolf.

Lastly, Their King permitted the _Spaniards_ to build a Lodge or Hovel,
wherein thirty or forty of them might shelter; but indeed so taking
possession in right of the King of _Spain_.

[Sidenote: Returns to _Spain_.]

[Sidenote: Is highly honor’d.]

[Sidenote: Goes with seventeen Sail a second time to _Hispaniola_.]

Mean while _Columbus_ return’d in safety to _Spain_, and was receiv’d
with great joy, King _Ferdinand_ making him Admiral of the Sea, and
sending his Brother _Bartholomew_ Governor to _Haytin_, now call’d
_Hispaniola_. The Gold, Parrots, Mastick, Aloes, the strange Bread
_Jucca_, whose extracted Juyce is rank Poyson, but the Body makes good
Meal, which kneaded and bak’d, yields a fine Manchet and wholesom Food,
they look’d upon with great delight and admiration; but two of the
Natives being naked, with Gold Rings through their Noses and Ears,
Ornaments with them of high esteem, and signifying their no mean
Quality, the People old and young came in Throngs to wonder at, never
weary of gazing upon them. But the King, encourag’d by this Success,
took no dilatory Course, but suddenly, and before any could expect,
built fourteen stout Carvels, and three Frigats, and as soon mann’d them
with twelve hundred Soldiers, besides a great number of Artificers of
all sorts, with their Wives and Children, freighting them with Horses,
Swine, Goats, Cattel for Breed, all sorts of _European_ Corn to sow,
Fruit-Trees and Vines to plant, and some Priests to instruct and convert
the Natives to their Religion.

[Sidenote: _The Barbadoes_, _St. Christophers_, _&c._]

[Sidenote: The Huts of the _Cannibals_.]

The second of _September_, _Anno 1493._ they set sail from _Cadiz_, and
Anchor’d before _Ferreo_, the last and furthest of the _Canary-Islands_,
where they could get no Water, but what dropp’d from the Dew hanging on
Trees into Troughs. After that, _Columbus_ came on the one and twentieth
day amongst the _Caribby-Islands_, where he dropp’d Anchor before one,
which he call’d _Dominico_; but finding it desolate, set sail further,
and discover’d several other Coasts, where he likewise found nothing but
very great Porcupines or Hedg-hogs, and sweet-smelling Trees. Steering
forward, he found the Coasts of the _Cannibals_, which inhabited along
the Shore in little Huts or Hovels, built round of Wood, and stak’d
about on the out-side with long Poles, like _Palisado_’s: They have also
Posts within, which are shorter, pleited and fastned together with
Cotton, or long Roots of Trees, plyant like our Osiars, over which they
hang Cloths painted with horrible Figures and strange Representations:
The Roofs rise like our Canopy’d Tents, highest in the middle, cover’d
with Palm-Tree Leaves to keep off the Rain: At the Entrances hang two
Hairy Images on Poles, not for Religion sake, but Ornament: Their
Bed-steads being high from the Ground, are fill’d with a kind of Straw;
and in long Hovels fitted for that purpose they store their Sugar.

[Sidenote: Island _Guadalupe_.]

_Columbus_ landing here, found all the _Cannibals_ fled; but their
Houses full of Stone Vessels, Cruises, Pans, and Pots, boyling with Mens
Flesh, Parrots, and Wild-foul; the Hanches and Sides of young Men, on
Spits roasting at the Fire, with the Splinters of whose broken Bones
they headed their Arrows. This Island by the Inhabitants call’d
_Carucueria_, _Columbus_ chang’d to _Guadalupe_, because the Mountains
rise up with their tops not unlike _Estremadura_ in _Spain_, famous
there for the wonderful Representation of our Lady, as that of the Lady
of _Loretto_ in _Italy_. Thirty Women which he had taken from the
neighboring Isles, he sent with Presents to the fled _Canibals_, which
the next day returning, made a great appearance near the Shore; but when
they had gaz’d a while upon the _Spaniards_, looking stedfastly on one
another, they suddenly ran back again, sheltring themselves in the
Covert of the Woods. _Columbus_ thinking it not worth his while to
expect their return, seeing their barbarous Life, burnt and destroy’d
all their Boats, and spoiling whatever he could, sail’d to _Matanino_.

[Sidenote: Strange Women in _Matanino_.]

The releas’d Women in _Guadalupe_, that came back again, inform’d the
_Spaniards_, That _Matanino_ was an Isle onely inhabited by Women, which
at accustom’d times row’d over to these _Cannibals_, where a while they
drove a Trade and Commerce of Love, the Product of which, if Girls, they
kept; but the Boys they sent over to their Fathers. They live in Caves,
the Mouths and Entrances of which they maintain and stoutly make good
with their Bowe, shooting Arrows as thick as Hail at the approach of
Men, after their impregnating by the _Cannibals_.

[Sidenote: Remarkable Passage of _Columbus_.]

[Sidenote: Salvageness of the _Indians_.]

From hence the Fleet pass’d by several other fruitful Islands,
_Columbus_ giving them the Names of _Montseratto_, _Rodondo_, _St.
Martin_, _Santa Cruz_, formerly by the Inhabitants call’d _Ayaya_. On
this last Island he landed thirty Men, who took four Women, which held
out their Hands before them, as if Petitioners that begg’d Quarter, or
praying, and then conceal’d themselves in Ambuscade, the better to
surprize more; when by chance they spied an _Indian_ _Canoo_ at Sea,
with eight Men, and as many Women; whereupon those in Ambuscade made a
Signal to the next Ship, which immediately sent off some Boats well
Mann’d; but before they drew near them, or expected an On-set, one of
the _Spaniards_ was kill’d, and another wounded with their Arrows;
amongst whom a Woman, to whom all the rest shew’d greatest Respect and
Reverence, aim’d very exactly. Their barbed Shafts were poyson’d;
whereupon the _Spaniards_ enrag’d, stemm’d the _Canoo_, and oversetting,
row’d quite over; which little or nothing avail’d; for they all swam,
and though separated, shot their Arrows at them, as if the Boat had been
a But. At last the _Indians_ got upon a blind Rock, cover’d with Shole
Water, which gave them fresh Courage; but the _Spaniards_ having more
aid sent them from the Fleet, took them all Prisoners; but the Queens
Son being wounded in the Scuffle, and dying soon after, was thrown
overboard. The Prisoners being brought before _Columbus_, foam’d at the
Mouth for raging madness; and being afterwards carried to _Castile_, so
retain’d their fierce and salvage Nature, that they scar’d away and
frighted the safe Beholders.

[Sidenote: _Decas 1. De Orba Novo._]

Mean while the _Spanish_ Fleet proceeded on their Voyage, between
several Islands, to _Hispaniola_, of which some appear desolate and
barren, others green and Woody; the small Vessels sailing close under
the Shore, and the great ones standing further off at Sea, which was
very turbulent, and beat exceedingly against the Shole Rocks. The Island
_Burichema_, _Columbus_ call’d _St. Johns_, to which belong’d some of
the Women sent forth in _Guadalupe_, who inform’d them, That _Burichema_
was well inhabited by a kind and hospitable People, who when the
_Cannibals_ landed there fought them, and if Conquerors, were so much
exasperated with their inhumane Barbarisms, that they seiz’d on them
like Mastiffs open-mouth’d, and tore them piece-meal with their Teeth;
yet themselves abhorring the Custom of eating Mens Flesh. Here the
_Spaniards_ found onely a large House, surrounded with twelve lesser
ones, all deserted; for the Inhabitants with their King _Chiasichio_
were then retir’d into the cool and more sheltring Woods, from the
mid-day Heat. All this the _Indians_ told him, which he brought back
with him from _Spain_. Coming to an Anchor at _Hispaniola_, he sent one
of the _Indians_ ashore, that he might tell what brave things he had
seen in the _Spanish_ Court; but the remaining three took the advantage
of the following Night, and leaping over-board, swam to Shore. But this
Accident he not much regarded, trusting to have a sufficient Account
from his eight and thirty _Spaniards_ which he had left in the Fort upon
the Island; and the more, because King _Guaccanarillo_’s brother, in
sign of Friendship, had presented him with two Golden Images: But all
these Conjectures fail’d him, so that hearing nothing, he landed, where
he found the _Spanish_ Garrison utterly destroy’d, and the Royal Fort
burnt down to the Ground, and lying in a heap of Ashes. Then they fired
several Guns, to give notice, that if any of them had conceal’d
themselves, and lay sculking in the Woods, or otherwise, they should
discover themselves, and come to the succour of their Friends: But all
in vain, for none came; for as they were afterwards inform’d, the
Inhabitants had slain them, because of their insupportable behavior,
insolently committing Robberies, Rapes, and Murders: Hereupon he sent
Messengers to the King _Guaccanarillo_, to inquire why they had fired
his Fort, and what they had done with his Men, who brought him this
Return, That over that mighty Island were many Princes, of which two
being provok’d by the reports of the Strangers that were entertain’d in
the Island, came marching upon them, each with their Armies; but that he
endeavor’d what he could, and came with a Power to assist the Strangers;
yet all he got for his Kindness, was a Wound in his Leg, which had been
so sore and troublesom, that forc’d him to keep his Bed, and no less
than seven Concubines to attend him, and dress the Wound: But he told
his Tale so ill, and feign’d his Lameness worse, that _Sibilius_, one of
the Messengers sent by _Columbus_, lifting up the Coverlet, saw that he
ail’d nothing, which soon confirm’d his doubt, that he was confederated
with the rest, and alike guilty of the Slaughter. At last
_Guaccanarillo_ being desir’d, came in Person to _Columbus_, in whose
presence he held a long Discourse with an _Indian_ Woman, which they had
brought from the Island of _Santa Cruz_, there Christned by the Name of
_Catharine_: At length _Guaccanarillo_ was dismiss’d, and the Night
following this _Catharine_, with seven more of the _Indian_ Women,
leap’d over-board, and swom almost a League to Shore, so going thence
directly to their King _Guaccanarillo_. This Accident gave more
suspicion to _Columbus_, who thereupon sent three hundred Men, commanded
by _Melchior_, _Hoieda_, and _Gorvalano_, to march through the Island
three several ways, and with special Commission to secure as their
Prisoner _Guaccanarillo_. _Melchior_ discover’d a wide River, full of
Reaches and winding Bays, gliding between high Hills cover’d with Woods,
resounding with the ecchoing noises of harmonious Birds, and
disemboguing his Waters, enlarg’d by two other Rivers, into the Sea, so
making a convenient Harbor for Ships. Here a hundred of the Islanders,
well Arm’d after their manner, met them, crying aloud, _We are no_
Cannibals, _but_ Taynos, that is, _a People more civil than they are
cruel_. The _Spaniards_ making Signs of Peace, the _Taynos_ approach’d,
and joyn’d their Forces in a friendly manner. Near the place of this
Meeting appear’d a House built in an Oval fashion, being thirty two
Paces in the Circumference, the Roof curiously pleited of divers
colour’d Rushes, round about which stood thirty lesser Dwellings. Mean
while, in his March _Hoieda_ discover’d a River that descended from a
high Mountain, where the Inhabitants gather’d much Gold after this
manner: They dig a Hole about two Foot deep; then taking up their left
Hand full of Sand, with their right Hand they cull out the precious
Ingots, which little accounting of, as they gather’d, they dealt away to
the _Spaniards_. Most of the Pieces were as big as Pease, yet some so
large, that they weigh’d nine Ounces. _Peter Martyr_, Councellor to the
Emperor _Charles_, tells us, That he hath seen of them in the _Spanish_
Court, that were brought over thither by _Columbus_. Moreover, _Hoieda_
was inform’d here, That this Gold-River took its Original in the
Province belonging to _Cacicus Caunaboa_, signifying, _The King of the
Golden Palace_.

[Sidenote: _Columbus_ builds a City.]

[Sidenote: Strange fruitfulness there.]

Mean time _Columbus_ selected a piece of Ground on a rising Hill, on the
North part of the Isle, where he intended to build a City, because close
by the Hill on one side rises a Mountain, pregnant with Stone and Chalk;
on the other, a Plain, so exceeding fruitful and pleasant, that the Sun
scarce shines upon a more delightful and fertile Soil, which they found
afterwards by experience. Here Melons are set and ripe in thirty six
days; Corn, in two Months; twice a Year the Trees and Plants bring forth
their several Products; the Vines come to maturity, and are loaden with
Clusters of Grapes, in two Years, and Sugar-Canes grow as thick as a
Mans Arm in fifteen days. On this pleasant Soil, accommodated with a
convenient Haven, _Columbus_ afterwards built the City _Isabella_,
fortified with Walls and Trenches against all Invasions, over which he
made his Brother _Bartholomew Columbus_ first Governor.

Mean while the Admiral _Columbus_ himself march’d up into the Countrey
with three hundred Men, in quest of the Gold Mines. Seventy two Leagues
the Valley _Cibava_ lies distant from _Isabella_, to which _Columbus_
pass’d over swift Currents and high Mountains, where he built a Fort,
which he call’d _St. Thomas_; and exchang’d with the Inhabitants Toys
and Trifles, for Pieces and Ingots of Gold, which the Inhabitants, as
before-mention’d, found in the Sand of their Rivers: And besides, they
inform’d him, That about half a days Journey further, greater Quantities
of Gold were to be found, in a browner colour’d Soil: Whereupon
_Luxanus_, one of his Officers, was sent with a sufficient Party
thither, who march’d through a delightful way, cool with shady Boughs,
and pleasant with the prospect of spacious Meadows, where they mow’d
Grass for their Horses, which in four days time grew up again higher
than our tallest Wheat.

[Sidenote: Goes to Sea to discover new Countreys.]

Mean time _Columbus_ being return’d with great Riches to his new City
_Isabella_, went soon after by Sea, with three Vessels, to discover new
Countreys more remote; which his Design fell out also successfully; for
he fell first upon _Jamaica_, where he found more stout Opposition than
elsewhere, by the Natives, at his Landing; but finding themselves
over-power’d, they came to Agreement, and accepting an amicable
Composure, presently struck up a Peace. From thence putting to Sea, he
next discover’d _Cuba_, which sailing round about, he found also to be
an Island; where Landing in a convenient Harbor, on each fenc’d with a
high and jutting Rock, he espied two little Hovels, wherein was
abundance of Fish, besides two great Snakes or Serpents, each having
eight Feet, spitted, and ready to be laid to the Fire to be roasted; but
neither Man, Woman, nor Child to be seen, they being gone with part of
the Fish they had dress’d, into the adjacent Woods; whither the
_Spaniards_ following, saw hanging by small Strings, on the Branches of
Trees, abundance of Snakes, some of which had their Mouths tied
together, others their Tongue and Teeth pull’d out. Hence marching on, a
little beyond they saw a Company of the Natives, which they judg’d to be
about seventy Men, covering the top or summit of a Hill, to whom the
_Spaniards_ made Signs, and to entice them near, shew’d several of their
gawdy Trifles; but in vain, till at last one adventur’d, descending from
the Hill, to whom one of the Natives (who in the first Voyage that the
Admiral made, was taken from the Island _Guanabaini_ near _Cuba_,
carried to _Spain_, and there Christned) call’d aloud, telling him they
need not fear, they should have no harm done them; which said, they came
down all together, and inform’d them, That they were sent by their King
to catch Fish for another King, which was with him at Dinner; and if
they had not eaten the Serpents, they gave them many thanks; for they
were provided for the second Course, and very scarce to be got, being a
greater Dainty than any Fish.

[Illustration]

[Sidenote: Discovers not without great Accidents, several New
           Countreys.]

_Columbus_ from hence proceeding on further Westward, discover’d a
fruitful Coast, verging the Mouth of a River, whose Water runs boyling
hot into the Sea. Somewhat further he saw very strange Fishes,
especially the _Guaican_, not unlike an Eel, but with an extraordinary
great Head, over which hangs a Skin like a Bag. This Fish is the Natives
Fisher; for having a Line or handsom Cord fastned about him, so soon as
a Turtel, or any other of his Prey, comes above Water, they give him
Line; whereupon the _Guaican_, like an Arrow out of a Bowe, shoots
towards the other Fish, and then gathering the Mouth of the Bag on his
Head like a Purse-net holds them so fast, that he lets not loose till
hal’d up out of the Water.

Here the _Spaniards_ having Din’d on delicate Fish, went on still
Westward, and came to an uninhabited Isle, but well stor’d with Geese,
Pelicans, and ugly Dogs that could not bark. Here they came amongst so
many Shoals, that the Keels of their Ships raked upon the Ground almost
forty Leagues together, the Water thick and white like Milk. Lastly,
they came again into deep Water, and Landed at the Foot of a high
Mountain, on the Island _Cuba_; where they found two Springs of very
sweet Water. A Musqueteer going into the Woods whilst the rest fill’d
their Vessels with Water and cut Wood, he spied a tall Man in a Coat
like a white Fryer’s Frock; behind whom came two more, and soon after
thirty more follow’d, all alike Habited: the Musqueteer running away,
they beckned him to stay, but he march’d off; and informing _Columbus_
of his Adventure, he sent a Party well Arm’d to see farther into the
Countrey; but they neither saw nor heard any Men, onely found on the
other side of the Wood a great Plain, but so overgrown with deep Grass,
that it was impossible to get through: The next day he sent out twenty
five more, which found nothing else than the Prints of the Steps of
great Beasts and Lyons, and also abundance of large Grapes, which hung
on the Branches of Vines, clasping about the Bodies of the great Trees.

Hence _Columbus_ again putting to Sea, and Sailing Westerly, found a
Shore overflow’d with Water, and abounding with Pearl-Mussles, and after
that the whole Countrey full of Mountains, whose tops smoaked. By this
time the Fleet was much damnified by the Shole-water; where, as we
mention’d before, they often struck, and their Keels rak’d upon the
Ground; so that having sprung several Leaks, and their Provisions
growing mouldy with the Damp, they were forc’d to return; and Tacking
about they ran against Turtles, which lay as thick in the Sea as if they
had been sow’n.

_Columbus_ now on his return home, and Landing once more on _Cuba_,
found an antient Man stark naked, who speaking to him (_Didacus_
interpreted, the Language in some part agreeing with that of
_Hispaniola_) to this effect:

_You have to all admiration come to see this Countrey from another
World, my advice to you is, That you hurt none; for the Souls of
evil-doers go to dark places: But on the contrary, they shall enjoy the
heighth of all Pleasures that are Friends to Peace._

_Columbus_ reply’d, _That he came a Scourge for the cruel Cannibals, but
a Shield to protect the quiet and well-meaning Indians_.

[Sidenote: Great disturbance in _Hispaniola_.]

After this, returning to _Hispaniola_, much contrary to his expectation,
he found all things which he had setled there turn’d topsie-turvy: for
first the Governors at _Isabella_ jangled, and were at private
contentions amongst themselves, and the _Benedictine_ Monk _Boilus_ and
_Peter Margarites_ were return’d to _Spain_; there to make their
complaints at Court: and besides, the _Spaniards_ had dealt very
inhumanely with the Natives, by their frequent Rapes, Thefts, and
Murders; wherefore the _Indians_, not unjustly incens’d, destroy’d all
the _Spaniards_ they found stragling in any part without the Lines of
their Fortification. _Caunaboa_ also lay about the Fort _St. Thomas_,
and closely besieged _Hoieda_; but receiving intelligence of
_Columbus_’s arrival, he broke up his Siege, and march’d from thence,
but soon after was taken Prisoner by the _Spaniards_. Mean while upon
Design (a Plot none of the wisest) the Natives of _Hispaniola_ had
neither Till’d or Sow’d the Ground, or us’d Agriculture the year before,
contriving by want of Provisions (not considering themselves) to starve
out the _Spaniards_; but the mischief fell upon the Contrivers: for so
great a Famine hapned, that spreading over the whole Countrey, in a few
Moneths fifty thousand were starv’d to death; but the _Spaniards_ made a
saving, though hard shift with their own store, then, though too late,
the Islanders repented of their folly, for they saw the _Spaniards_
making an advantage of their misery, not onely built more Houses in
their City _Isabella_, but prepar’d their Weather-beaten Vessels, with
which Sailing to the Gold Mountains of _Cipangi_ on the Hill, whence
sprung several Fountains, they rais’d the Castle of the _Conception_.
Great benefit they reap’d by this Fort, to which they carry’d daily
abundance of Amber, Brimstone, mix’d Ore of Silver and Gold, and
_Brazile_-wood, besides great store of Gold: and they might have gotten
ten times more, had they not been so much inclin’d to slothfulness, and
minding other vain pleasures: yet notwithstanding all, the Fleet carry’d
that year above one thousand two hundred pound weight of Gold to
_Spain_.

[Sidenote: _Spaniards_ tyrannise there.]

In the mean while the Natives complain’d to _Columbus_ of the _Spanish_
Soldiers, which under pretence to seek for Gold, committed many
insufferable Outrages; therefore they desir’d that they might be
retain’d in their Forts, and not straggle so much abroad, and they would
willingly bring them every three Moneths a certain weight of Cotton,
Amber, _Brazile_-wood, and Gold, more than equivalent to what they
snatch’d; but _Columbus_ (whose Soldiers, notwithstanding his severity,
and using Martial Law upon some of them for their Crimes, and proud with
their success) yet prevail’d at last, that they consented thereto; but
the Inhabitants never perform’d their promise, who being almost
famish’d, had much to do to preserve themselves alive, spending their
time in picking Sallads.

[Sidenote: Their Conquest.]

Whilst the Business remain’d in this ill posture, or rather confusion,
_Cibanus_, Brother to the imprison’d _Caunaboa_, rais’d an Army of five
thousand Men: the _Spaniards_, divided into five Companies, march’d to
meet him; and their Enemies being naked, and having no other Arms than
Bowes, Arrows, and Clubs, after some little resistance, were soon
dissipated and put to flight, but overtaken by the _Spanish_ Horse, many
of them were taken Prisoners, and others forc’d to skulk and hide
themselves on the tops of Mountains.

[Sidenote: Horible Tempest.]

[Sidenote: A remarkable passage concerning _Bartholomew Columbus_.]

[Sidenote: Brave reception of a King in _Hispaniola_.]

Shortly after this Battel hapned a Huricane, mix’d with Thunder-claps,
renting great pieces from the Rocks, and the Wind blowing out of the
East, threw down Houses and Trees, some of which were carry’d a vast
heighth into the Air; three Ships that rode in the Harbor, broke their
new Cables, and split against the Rocks. The _Spaniards_ expected nought
else, but that with this excessive Tempest the Day of Judgment was at
hand. And on the other side, the Islanders ascribed this raging of
Heavens to the _Spaniards_ wickedness. This Storm past, and the Air
setled, _Columbus_ gave order for the building of two new Ships there,
with which in _March_, _Anno 1495._ he return’d to _Spain_; where in
_Medina del Campo_ he gave an account at the Court about the discover’d
Countreys; where also Sentence was pass’d on several _Spaniards_, and
chiefly concerning the _Benedictine_ Monk _Boilus_, who out of meer
malice pass’d by him at Mass with the Host, while he gave it to others,
without any distinction. Then he gave a further account, that his
Brother _Bartholomew_ had found, sixty Leagues beyond _Isabella_,
several deep Pits, the uppermost Ground of which Sifted, produced
abundance of Gold. Moreover, that he had built the Castle _Aurea_ there
in three Moneths time with little trouble: but because Provisions grew
scarce there, he found himself necessitated to remove, but left ten Men
in the Garrison, and had sent three hundred of the Islanders with their
Governors to _Spain_. He also built the Castle _Dominico_, on the
South-side of _Hispaniola_; from whence he had travell’d into the
Countrey to the River _Naiba_: where, upon this Shore the King _Beuchio
Anacauchoa_ Encamp’d himself against the _Naibans_, to bring them,
besides several other People, under his subjection. That _Bartholomew_
demanded Tribute of _Anacauchoa_, which he immediately promis’d to pay,
and disbanded his Forces, conducting _Bartholomew_ above thirty Leagues
on his Way, along a Path on both sides sown with Hemp, and planted with
Cotton-Trees, to his Palace _Xaraqua_, in the West of _Hispaniola_,
where he was received in great state: Thirty of the Kings Wives walk’d
before, carrying in their Hands Boughs of Palm-trees, and both Sung and
Danc’d very strangely; behind these came a considerable number of naked
Virgins, very handsom; at last _Bartholomew_ entring the Palace with the
King, found a Table furnish’d with all manner of Dainties, and a very
courteous Entertainment. The next day walking forth to a large Plain,
and looking about he saw two Parties that deeply engag’d in Fight behind
a Hill, with great slaughter on both sides, and had not he desir’d that
they might be parted, there had been much more Blood shed. After he had
been several days friendly entertain’d, he return’d to the Forts
_Isabella_, _Sperancia_, _Catharina_, _St. Jago_, _Turrita_,
_Conception_, and _Dominico_; where he found above three hundred
_Spaniards_ starv’d of hunger, besides many that were sick.

[Illustration]

[Illustration: ANGRA op TERCERA.]

At that time _Guarionexius_ having been oppress’d by the _Spaniards_,
and a long time watching for an opportunity, now thinking he had found
it, rais’d an Army of fifteen thousand Men, with which he was resolv’d
to try his fortune against _Columbus_; who privately receiving
intelligence thereof, fell upon him so on a sudden and unexpectedly,
that he spoil’d his Design, and took all his Commanders Prisoners: But
to oblige the Inhabitants, who begg’d for their King, _Columbus_ set him
at liberty, advising him to be careful of raising a War against him any
more. But he not being able to endure the oppressions of _Roldanus
Ximenez_, a _Spanish_ Commander, fled to the wild _Ciquano_’s, descended
from the Canibals, and living on steep Mountains: Of these he desir’d
aid against the _Spaniards_, and obtain’d not onely their Promise, but
some Men; with which he robb’d and pillag’d the Countrey round about,
and what _Spaniards_ he met with he kill’d, and with his Men did eat, as
if a Venison Feast. Mean while _Ximenez_ made himself Leader of seventy
Rebels, which like raging blood-hounds fell upon the Natives after a
terrible manner.

[Sidenote: _Columbus_ Sails the third time to _Hispaniola_.]

[Sidenote: Description of the City _Angra_.]

Whilst all things were thus in disorder at _Hispaniola_, the Admiral
_Christopher Columbus_ set Sail a third time with eight Ships from the
Haven _Barrameda_, in the Year 1498. To shun the _French_ Pyrates, which
watched for the _Indian_ Treasures, he directed his Course to _Madera_,
a fruitful Island of Corn, Wine, Sugar, Wax, and Cattel, desolate till
_Anno 1420._ Here coming to an Anchor, he sent six Ships away to
_Hispaniola_, which himself afterwards followed with the remaining two,
steering by the _Flemish_ Islands, or _Acores_, first so call’d from the
_Flemings_, the first Planters: Here he dropt Anchor before the City
_Angra_ on the Isle _Tercera_, which is sixteen Leagues in
circumference, and very Mountainous; the tops whereof are like Spires,
and abound with Grapes: the Plain Countrey produces great store of Corn,
but it will not keep above twelve Moneths. The Ground is oftentimes
terribly shaken by Earthquakes, and between several sulphurous Places,
both Flames and Smoak ascend up to the Sky. Near the City _Angra_ is a
Fountain which turns Wood into Stone. The Winds in this Place blow so
fierce and strong, that they not onely beat down Houses, but wear out
Iron, and all manner of Stone-work. In _Angra_ the chief Commander of
all the _Flemish_ Isles hath his Residence. The City, surrounded by
steep Rocks, lies towards the Sea like a Crescent, or Half-Moon; for at
both ends thereof the Mountains extend with deep Points into the Ocean.
The uppermost part towards the West stands likewise fortifi’d by a high
Rock, as also by another on the East: on both are continual Watches
kept; whereof those on the first can discover Ships fifteen Leagues off
at Sea, coming either from the _East_ or _West-Indies_; and on the
other, all those that come from _Europe_: When they see above fifteen
Sail, they put out the Kings great Flag upon the top of all the Rock.

This City of _Angra_ is divided into several Streets: the Governor and
Archbishop live each in a stately Palace; five handsom Churches are no
small ornament to it; the Sea before it abounds with Fish, but are not
to be taken in _December_, by reason of the turbulent Waves.

_Christopher Columbus_ having refresh’d at _Angra_, Sail’d along the
_African_ Coast between the _Hesperides_: under the Equinoctial he was
so miserably tormented by the Heat, that his Vessels seem’d to burn, the
Hoops sprung from the Casks, so that the Water run about the Hold; and
they could expect nothing but death from the insufferable Heat, and want
of Water: eight days they had endur’d this hardship, when they met with
a fresh Gale out of the South-East, so that they made great Way towards
the West. On the last of _July_ he discover’d three high Mountains; and
approaching near the Shore, he smelt as in a Posie, all the sweet
breathings of fragrant Flowers commix’d, and at last saw a convenient
Haven; where going ashore he found cultivated Grounds, and steps of
Beasts, but not a Man appear’d: the next day they spy’d a Boat with
twenty young Men come rowing from the Shore into the Ocean. The Admiral
hal’d them in vain to come aboard, for they made the greater hast
ashore, still looking about continually with great admiration on the
Ships: whereupon he commanded them to beat their Drums, and sound their
Trumpets, that they might by that means entice them aboard; but they
rather taking it as a sign of War, made themselves ready for resistance:
mean while the _Spaniards_ overtook the _Indian_ Boat, into which they
threw a Hat, and other trifles; the Islanders amaz’d thereat, made signs
to them to row ashore; but soon after they fled.

[Sidenote: Abundance of Pearl.]

_Columbus_ proceeding on his Journey came to _Paria_, where he found a
Fishers Pink loaden with Oysters; which opening and taking out the Meat,
were found full of Pearls, which because of their abundance were not
regarded there; for a broken Dish and a rusty Knife, the _Spaniards_ had
four long Strings of Pearl.

[Sidenote: _Columbus_ is in great danger.]

From thence anchoring in the River of _Cumana_, several naked Men came
aboard, adorn’d with Golden Armlets, and Strings of Pearl, These
inform’d him, that they gather’d their Gold from the Mountains and
Rivers, and caught their Pearl-oysters in the adjacent Seas. Some of the
_Spaniards_ were nobly entertain’d by the King and his Son, who leading
them into their Palace, placed them on Benches of Ebony-wood, curiously
wrought, and on a sudden several Servants came in with variety of
Dainties, and well-tasted Wine. But because Provisions grew scarce
amongst the Sea-men, and their Meat tainted, _Columbus_ thought it
convenient to leave the Pearl-trade till some better opportunity. Then
setting forward, the farther he went, the shallower he found the Sea,
insomuch that his Ship scarce had Water enough to swim. This
inconvenience was followed by a second; for the Sea being full of Weeds
and Grass, scarce suffer’d any Passage. A River thirty Yards deep, and
twenty Leagues broad, came rushing out betwixt two Shores into this Sea
with such force, that the Waves went high like Mountains, which made
_Columbus_ judge himself in the greatest danger imaginable, and withall
Tack about; so that he came on the eight and twentieth of _August Anno
1498._ to an Anchor before _Hispaniola_, where all things were still in
a sad confusion, as we before related.

[Sidenote: _Roldanus Ximenes_ opposes _Columbus_.]

[Sidenote: Strange _Indians_.]

_Roldanus Ximenes_ refus’d to follow _Christopher Columbus_’s, order and
writ Letters to the King of _Spain_, in which he exceedingly aspersed
both the Admiral _Columbus_ and his Brother; who were not backward in
giving an account quite contrary by their Letters, of the horrid
Villanies perpetrated by this _Ximenes_, and desir’d aid, that so great
an Offender might receive condign punishment. Mean while the _Ciquano_’s
came marching down with six thousand Men, which _Bartholomew_ went to
meet with eighty Foot and some few Horse: The _Indians_ which he was to
encounter with, rather seeming like Furies than Men, for all of them
were daub’d over with black smuts on their bare Skins from Head to Foot,
and their hard Hair pleited in terrible, not in Lovelocks, hung playing,
or dangling over their Shoulders. When the _Spaniards_ in their March
drawing up to a River where it was best fordable, had no sooner left the
Bank, and taken the Water, endeavoring to wade over, but the Salvages
rush’d forth out of the Woods, and let flye a showre of Arrows, that had
they not been provided with Shields and Targets, to keep off such a
deadly Storm, so thick they flew, and so well aim’d, most of them had
perish’d there: but having recover’d the opposite Bank, the Enemy play’d
all hid, and in a thought shelter’d themselves under the protection of
the Woods; where the Conqueror pursuing, found the Service very
difficult and dangerous, for their Armes, especially their Shields,
stopping and intangling them as in a Net, among the shrubby and twining
Branches; which they passing, rigled themselves, and made their way,
like questing Spaniels following their Game, and still gawling them with
their Arrows: whereupon they left their vain pursuit, marching another
way to intercept _Mayobanexius_, who with eight thousand _Ciquano_’s
were then coming down against them; which prov’d a harder task than was
expected: for e’re he could reduce him and his stubborn Party, he spent
three Moneths in the Service.

[Sidenote: Hath very bad success in his fourth Expedition.]

[Sidenote: Fights with _Poresius_.]

[Sidenote: Dies.]

But the great and worthy Service of these two excellent Brothers
deserving rather Statues and Trophies of everlasting Honor, Monuments
never to be demolish’d, in their due praise, who had found out after so
many baffled Ages, a new World, richer, and not much less than the old,
by the aspersing calumniations of one malicious Person, lost his whole
Interest and Credit in the _Spanish_ Court, quite out of favour with his
Prince, who by his insinuations had hinted so much the matter of Gain
among the Courtiers, that every one studied no less than to get a
Commission, and so going a Commander to the _Indies_, make up his Mouth,
and become suddenly rich. First _Francisco Bombadilla_ prevailing, was
sent with full Commission to succeed _Columbus_ in _Hispaniola_; where
no sooner Landing, but he exercis’d the extremity of his Authority, and
seizing the Admiral and his Brother, fetter’d their Hands and Feet, and
put them aboard on two several Ships for _Spain_: where no sooner
arriv’d, but the King, not altogether forgetting former Services,
commanded them to be unmanacled, and waited on, not as Prisoners, with a
civil Retinue to his Court; where they were well entertain’d three
years. But they being active Persons, weary of so long repose, got a
second Grant to make farther discoveries, and set forth the ninth of
_May, Anno 1504._ with four Sail well appointed from _Cadiz_, and had a
fair Passage from thence to _Hispaniola_, where begun the Storm, for
_Bombadilla_, who had by the Kings Commission so evil treated _Columbus_
and his Brother, as aforemention’d, would not suffer him, though
reconciled to the King, so much as to Land, and there refresh themselves
and their Men; so he was forc’d to steer on to the Islands _Guamixa_ and
_Veragua_, where a Huricane, or sudden stress of Weather sunk two of his
Vessels; the other two standing off to Sea escap’d bilging, but so
shatter’d and leaky, having also shipp’d abundance of Water, they were
resolv’d to put in at _Jamaica_; where weary with the long Voyage, and
hatter’d with the Tempest, many of his Sea-men, spent with sickness,
after their Landing, died. To these his sufferings from Wind and
Weather, and his Enemies abroad, a greater and intestine mischief
hapned: _Francisco Poresio_, one of his chief Commanders, absolutely
rebell’d, and deserting him, with another Party of his Sea-men went into
_Hispaniola_: which the Islanders observing, resolv’d to famish him,
keeping from him both Water and all other Provisions; which had not
_Columbus_ stav’d off by a handsom Invention, they had compleated their
Design, which was this: He told them that he was the offspring of the
Moon, and if they refus’d to supply his want, the Moon, in vindication
of her Son, would famish them, by spoiling what e’re they had planted or
sow’d; and that this would prove true they should know by a sign, that
on such a Night, she rising in her full glory, should first look red,
and afterwards by degrees lose a great part of her light; which indeed
so hapned, being Ecclips’d, as he could well prognosticate; and after
that, they being ignorant of the cause, suppli’d him with all
Necessaries. But _Poresio_, not able to endure the Sea with his small
Boats, resolv’d to surprize one of the Ships that lay before _Jamaica_;
but _Columbus_ so much prevented him, that meeting him in his return,
after a hot dispute made him his Prisoner. But thus ended not his
misfortunes; for the Vessels which he fought in soon after sunk, and no
ship to be found in _Jamaica_ to transport him thence. Lastly, he agreed
with some _Indian_ Fishermen, to carry _Didaco Mendoza_ to _St.
Dominica_, that there he might hire two Vessels to carry him back to
_Spain_: which Design taking effect, he arrived there in safety: where
after he had refresh’d himself at the _Spanish_ Court, after his so long
and unfortunate a Voyage he fell sick, and died on the eighth of _May_
1506.

Mean while, the Affairs of _Hispaniola_ grew more out of order: for
_Bombadilla_ joyning with _Ximenes_, resolv’d to hoard up a huge
Treasure of Gold, though with the infinite oppression of the Natives: of
which King _Ferdinand_ having intelligence, sent _Nicholas Olanda_
thither with thirty Sail; who being nominated Vice-Roy, anchor’d in
forty days before _Hispaniola_. No sooner arriv’d, but _Bombadilla_ and
_Ximenes_ fled, leaving their vast Treasure, amounting to ten hundred
thousand Ducats; which guarded with four hundred _Spaniards_ in twenty
four Ships was sent to _Spain_: but so it hapned, that they were all
swallowed up in the main Ocean, none knowing to this day in what
Latitude they were lost.

                   Pietro Alponso Nigno _his Voyage_.

[Sidenote: Description of _Curiana_.]

_Pietro Nigno_, encourag’d by some of those that had been with
_Columbus_ at the Isles of Pearl, Rigg’d out a Ship at his own charge,
with special order in his Commission, that he should not touch on any
Coast within fifty Leagues of any Place _Columbus_ had formerly
discover’d. But he little observ’d his Orders, and what he was
commanded; for Sailing into the Haven _Curiana_, he barter’d Shells,
Needles, Glass, and such like Trifles, for abundance of Pearls, which
the Islanders brought aboard, for he himself having but thirty Men,
durst not venture ashore. Twenty days this bartering Trade continued,
Orient Pearls for Toys; but finding at last, that they were a civil and
hospitable People, he Landed, where they entertain’d him in Hovels built
of Wood, and cover’d with Palm-Leaves; before their Doors lay great
Hills of Oyster-shells, the Fish being eaten, and the Pearls us’d for an
ornament; Conies, Hares, Pheasants, Pigeons, Geese, Ducks, Deer, and
wild Swine, are their usual Food; and their Bread is made of the Roots
of Trees. Moreover, _Curiana_ abounds with thick and shady Woods, which
resound in the night with the cries and roarings of wild Beasts: but
though they are terrible fierce and voracious, yet the Natives stoutly
venture in amongst the thickest of them, arm’d onely with Bowes and
Arrows. The Inhabitants are of Complexion tawny, their Hair long and
curl’d; their Teeth they keep white with an Herb, which they continually
hold betwixt their Lips. The Women perform their business of Husbandry,
Ploughing and Sowing. The Men are Soldiers, following the business of
War: but in Peace their Exercises are Hunting and Dancing. They keep
annual Fairs, where from all Parts of the Countrey they bring their
Commodities to buy and barter. They have their Gold from _Cauchieta_,
six days Sail Westward from _Curiana_.

Thither _Nigno_ next directed his course, and came to an Anchor there on
the first of _October, Anno 1500._ The Inhabitants entred aboard without
the least shiness, or fear of danger, and brought with them to barter,
Gold, Civet-Cats, Parrots, and Cotton.

These People, though so civil, are extreamly jealous of their Wives: for
when a _Spaniard_ made address to one of them, and coming something
close, her Husband stept in suddenly between, and seem’d to forbid the
Banns. But coasting onward along the Shore from thence to another Isle,
he found Natives far more wild and salvage: for two thousand in a Body
well Arm’d, stood ready to intercept their Landing; wherefore he thought
it his safest course to Tack about, and return to _Curiana_ whence he
came.

[Sidenote: _Nigno_ Fights with the Cannibals.]

In his Way not far from thence, he fell amongst eighteen of the
Cannibals Boats, which according to their custom had been a
Man-stealing, and now were so hardy, that setting upon the _Spanish_
Ship, they suddenly clapt him aboard with their _Canoos_ on all sides;
but being beaten back by the terror of their Guns, they soon retir’d:
yet the _Spaniards_ took one of the Boats with two Men, all the rest
saving themselves by swimming. One of the two Men lay bound Hand and
Foot, who told them, that he was to have been kill’d the next day and
eaten, as he saw his Companions, with whose Flesh they banquetting kept
a jovial Feast. _Nigno_ unbinding the Prisoner, gave him leave to do
what he pleas’d with the taken Cannibal, who falling upon him, cudgel’d
and whipp’d him to death.

[Sidenote: Strange Salt.]

Then _Nigno_ in his Way to _Curiana_ touch’d upon the Coast of _Paria_,
where he found a strange kind of Salt, which the Sea in tempestuous
Weather casts on the Shore, which afterwards hardens by the Sun. This
Salt must be taken up before any Rain fall, else it melts and soaks away
into the Ground; yet sometimes grows so hard as a Stone, insomuch that
they make Pots and other Vessels of it; which the _Parians_ barter for
foreign Commodities.

[Sidenote: Strange Corps.]

_Nigno_ not making here any stay, return’d a second time to _Curiana_,
where he spent twenty days in pleasant Pastimes, being Lodg’d in a
Noble-mans House, at whose Door was fix’d a Cannibals Head, as a Trophy
of his Victory. He saw there also the dead Bodies of divers eminent
Persons set drying at a Fire, so hardned to be set amongst their Idols.

[Sidenote: _Nigno_ put in Prison.]

[Sidenote: Cruel dealings in _Curiana_.]

At length _Nigno_ set Sail homewards, and carried with him an invaluable
Treasure in Pearls to _Spain_: but by the way fell out with his Sea-men,
because he kept most of the Purchase to himself, and would not give them
their shares, nay more than that, kept back the fifth part from the
King; whereupon being complain’d of by _Ferdinando de Vega_, Governor of
_Gallicia_, he was put in Prison, and at last sent to the Court, where
the Pearls were declared free Prize, because _Nigno_ had barter’d for
them at _Curiana_, contrary to the Kings Orders, not to touch at any
Coast, within fifty Leagues of what _Columbus_ had discover’d. But since
he had no way regarded those Commands to preserve that Pearl-Trade, King
_Ferdinand_ sent Governors to _Curiana_, who in his Name should look
after, and employ Men for the catching the Pearl-Oysters. These,
accompanied with a considerable number of Soldiers, besides six Monks,
forc’d the Inhabitants to furnish them with abundance of Pearl: which
oppression grew to such a heighth, that one Morning a great Party of
them conspiring together, fell suddenly upon them, most of them being
massacred: after they had a while insultingly triumphed over the dead
Bodies, and finish’d, as they thought, their good work (feasting on
their Flesh at a joyful Banquet) those few that escap’d Sail’d to the
Island _Dominic_, the Governor of which _Didacus Columbus_, Son to the
famous _Christopher_, being incens’d, immediately sent Captain _Ocampo_
with three hundred Men to _Curiana_; where in his first fury, without
distinction of Sex or Age, he slew all he met with. But because they
themselves could not follow the rich Oyster-catching, he spar’d some for
that purpose, whom he commanded to build twenty five little Houses, or
Hovels, on the Shore, which he call’d _New Toledo_. After this they went
on afresh in their Pearl-fishing.

                                SECT. V.
                 _The Voyage of_ Vincent Agnes Pinzon.

The first of _December, Anno 1499._ _Vincent Pinzon_ set Sail with four
Vessels out of the Haven _Palos_: he had been Commander of a Ship under
_Columbus_ in his first Expedition, by which means he got great
experience in Navigation. When he came a little beyond the _Hesperides_,
he was surpris’d by a great Storm, which in three days drove him before
a plain Coast; where Landing, he found nothing but the Footsteps of Men;
and in the night he saw great Fires, such as are generally made in
Camps; about day-break twenty _Spaniards_ march’d thither, whom thirty
two Men, arm’d with Bowes and Arrows, made ready to encounter; but as
they approached, the _Spaniards_ proffer’d them Peace, but they refused
all Composition; yet having faced one another a while, they retreated
without fighting.

[Sidenote: _Pinzon_’s strange Fight.]

[Sidenote: A remarkable Beast.]

After this _Pinzon_ discover’d a wide, but shallow River; where Landing,
on a Hill he met a great company of _Americans_: He, to invite them to
Trade, threw them a Shell; in return for which they cast him a lump of
Gold; which when the _Spaniard_ went to take up they all fell upon him;
and indeed he could not have defended himself long, had not some of his
Company quickly come in to his speedy rescue, which occasion’d a bloody
Conflict, wherein several _Spaniards_ were wounded, eight kill’d, and
one of their small Boats sunk; for the _Americans_ fought so valiantly,
that they pursu’d the _Spanish_ Ships into the Sea. _Pinzon_ being at
last freed of these Assailants, got into a fresh-water Sea, caus’d by
the confluence of many Rivers falling in there: from hence he got sight
of the _Parian_ Coast, and with admiration beheld a Tree which sixteen
Men could not compass: Between these Trees he saw as strange a Monster,
the foremost part resembling a Fox, the hinder a Monkey, the Feet were
like a Mans, with Ears like an Owl; under whose Belly hung a great Bag,
in which it carry’d the Young, which they drop not, nor forsake till
they can feed themselves. _Pinzon_ caught one of them with three Young,
which died in the Voyage, but the Dam he presented alive in _Granada_ to
the King.

[Illustration]

[Sidenote: Great Storm.]

This Captain having Sail’d six hundred Leagues along the _Parian_ Coast,
in a great Tempest two of his Carvils in his view were overset, their
Keels turn’d upward; the third driven from her Anchor, and the fourth so
shaken, and full of Leaks, that ready to sink they ran her ashore to
save their lives; and though he escaped himself the danger of drowning,
then being ashore, yet he was no ways freed from far greater
inconveniences; for he saw nothing but death either for want of
Provisions, or barbarousness of the Inhabitants: whereupon they resolv’d
to free themselves of their miseries by self-slaughter, killing one
another; but some better advised to spend their Lives like _Christians_
upon the unbelieving Salvages: Whilst they were in this desperate
condition, the Storm ceased, and Providence presented their safety, the
Ship driving in before the Wind; at which every one taking fresh
courage, they mended the two shatter’d Ships as well as they could;
wherein venturing to Sea, and setting Sail, they came on the last of
_September, Anno 1500._ into the _Spanish_ Haven _Palos_.


                               SECT. VI.
                _The Expedition of_ Americus Vesputius.

_Americus Vesputius_ a _Florentine_, Commanded four Ships, fitted out at
King _Ferdinand_’s Charge, set Sail the twentieth of _May, Anno 1497._
and refreshing at the _Canaries_, from thence he steer’d to _Paria_;
where he so much gain’d upon the Inhabitants, that for Pins, Bells,
Looking-glasses, and other Trifles, they daily brought aboard in Barter
great store of Gold, the best of Merchandise.

[Sidenote: The manner of the Inhabitants in _Paria_.]

[Sidenote: Their strange Customs.]

These People, both Men and Women go stark naked, not so much as covering
their _Pudenda_; their Complexion swarthy; they shave off all their
Hair, onely some Women leave a Tuft on their Heads. From their Faces,
being broad and flat, one may judge them to be deriv’d from _Tartary_;
they much exceed the _Europeans_ in Running and Swimming, insomuch that
the Women oftentimes without any Boats, or floating pieces of Timber,
venture two or three Leagues into the Sea; they have so great skill in
Shooting, that they exceed almost all other Nations, having Arrows
headed with sharp Fish-bones; they also use Lances and Clubs. The Women
follow the Men in the Wars, and serve in stead of Horses to carry
Ammunition and other Necessaries; to which Labor they are so us’d, that
they will bear on their Shoulders forty, nay fifty Leagues together,
such Luggage, as three _Spaniards_ are scarce able to lift from the
Ground. They acknowledge no Commander or Superior either in Wars or
Government; they keep up old Feuds, fighting with an inveterate hatred
against their Neighbors, upon antient scores and revenges, still kept in
memory of their Relations slain in former Battels, and also still
creating fresh animosities upon their Losses in later Engagements. Their
Language is smooth and pleasing, being spoken with a kind of lisping,
and absolutely different from the neighboring Nations. When they eat
they sit upon the Ground, and sleeping lie in Hammocks, each end whereof
being fastned to a Post; underneath they kindle a Fire; over them they
hang Fish-nets and Hooks, Fish-baskets and _Calabashes_. When they have
occasion to ease Nature by evacuation, they retire into some private
Place; but the Women think it no immodesty to make Water, even in the
presence of strange Men. They observe not single Matrimony; for every
Man takes as many Women as he pleases, under bonds of Wedlock such and
so sleight, that he turns them off at his pleasure: and Women take the
same liberty in casheering their Husbands when not pleasing them. They
bring forth Children with little or no pain, and wash them in a River so
soon as born; which done they return to their usual work and business.
When they are incens’d against their Husbands, they revenge themselves
by poysoning their Children. Their Houses are built in the fashion of a
House-clock, with a Roof rais’d from the Wall upon four Pillars like the
Bell, and cover’d with Palm-Leaves; some of which are so big, that they
afford room for six hundred Men: every seventh or eighth year they
remove, because (as they say) the Air is oftentimes infected by Mens
Breaths, by their long continuance in one place. Their Riches consist in
Feathers of divers colours, Strings of Fish-bones intermingled with
green and white Beads, with which they adorn their Heads, Arms, Legs,
Ears, and Cheeks: Gold and Pearls they make little account of; and as to
Trade and Commerce with other People, they know not what belongs to it.
Their greatest Friendship consists in prostituting their Daughters or
Wives to one another. Their Dead they bury in moist Grounds, and put
with them both Meat and Drink into the Graves: When any Person grows
very weak by lingring Sickness, they carry the Diseased into a
neighboring Wood, where they lay him in a Silk Hammock, tied between two
Trees; then dancing the whole day about him, at night they set Bread and
Water enough by him to last four days, and then departing look no more
after him, who thus neglected seldom escape: but if so it happen that
one recover, all his Relations for the future honour him as a god. When
any one falls into a Fever, his Friends immediately bathe him in cold
Water, and afterwards set him before a great Fire, then drive him before
them till he falls down almost breathless, and at last put him to Bed.
They neither Let blood in the Arms nor Feet, but in their Sides and
Calves of their Legs. Sometime they fast four days together, which they
suppose a great means to preserve their Health. Their Bread consists of
a sort of Fruit call’d _Jucha_, _Chambi_, or _Igname_. Lastly, no Lyon
devours his Prey with more voracious eagerness, than they their taken
Enemies.

[Sidenote: A very strange Village built on Poles.]

[Sidenote: Strange Fight.]

_Vesputius_ being fully inform’d concerning the Situation of _Paria_,
weighed Anchor, and on the sixth day after entred a convenient Harbor,
where going ashore, he found twenty Houses built in the middle of a Lake
on great Posts: every House had a Draw-bridge, over which they pass’d
from one to the other. So soon as the Inhabitants set eye on the
_Spaniards_, they immediately drew up their Bridges: yet some of them in
twelve little _Canoos_ came towards the _Spanish_ Ships, but amaz’d to
see their Looms so big, durst not, though hal’d with signs, to come
aboard, but hasted away to a high Mountain; yet seem’d to signifie that
they would return, as indeed they did, bringing sixteen Maids along with
them, of which they put four into a _Spanish_ Boat, themselves in the
interim rowing between the Ships from one to another, shewing all tokens
of friendship, when on a sudden a Company of old Women came running to
the Shore, and tearing the Hair from their Heads, made a terrible noise
and exclamation, expressing the greatest sorrow they could possible:
whereupon the four _Indian_ Maids suddenly leap’d over-board, and the
Men shot abundance of Arrows out of their Boats at the Ships; nay, some
of them swimming under Water, endeavor’d to sink the Cock-boats which
were made fast behind their Ships. Upon this sudden Onset the
_Spaniards_ making use of their Guns, quickly lessen’d the number of the
Assailants, insomuch that they fled to the Shore; yet five of them being
overtaken, were carry’d Prisoners aboard.

_Vesputius_ observing these their misdemeaning Carriages, judg’d it no
way convenient to stay any longer among such barbarous and deceitful
Salvages: but having weighed Anchor, and Sail’d eighty Leagues along the
Coast, he ran into another convenient Haven, whose Shore swarm’d with
People, which on a sudden running away, hid themselves in a neighboring
Wood.

[Sidenote: Serpents strangely prepar’d for Food.]

Here the _Spaniards_ Landing were amazed, when in their Huts they saw
Snakes and Serpents roasting before a Fire, whereof one had Wings, and
another whose Mouth was tied together with a Rope, stared with open eyes
in a frightful manner.

Here they left several Trifles to entice the fled Natives to correspond
with them. And this their Design prov’d successful; for the next day the
_Americans_ came aboard without the least fear, and offer’d to shew
their hospitable kindness to the _Spaniards_, if they pleas’d to travel
three days Journey with them up into the Countrey, telling them, they
had onely rais’d those few Huts by the Sea-side for a small time whilst
they Fish’d in those Parts.

[Sidenote: The remarkable reception of twenty three _Spaniards_.]

About twenty of the _Spaniards_ well Arm’d resolv’d to undertake the
Journey; and travelling over Hills, Dales, and Rivers, they came at last
into a Village consisting of nine of the foremention’d Houses, but
mightily peopled, where they were in a wonderful manner received by
their glad welcomes, by Dancing, Singing, Hunting, and other joyful
Acclamations, presenting their Wives and Daughters, as the chiefest part
of their hospitality, to caress the Strangers at their pleasure. The
news was no sooner spread, but the adjacent Villages came in throngs to
gaze upon, and salute the Strangers, inviting them also to their Towns.
The _Spaniards_ taking it in good part, spent nine days among them,
highly treated with all manner of jollities, but especially at their
choice with the varieties of _Venus_: from thence then returning to
their Fleet, accompanied with thousands of the Natives, every one
carrying Presents to the Admiral _Vesputius_; of whom as many as they
could at once receive, they entertaining aboard, then dismiss’d them,
and admitted others; but the Guns going off, they suddenly leap’d from
the Decks, and div’d like Ducks under Water: But afterwards being
inform’d, that such thunder-claps were sent them from Heaven to destroy
their Enemies, they were somewhat better satisfi’d, and call’d the
_Spaniards_, _Charabi_, that is, _Wise Men_.

[Sidenote: A cruel Fight with the Cannibals.]

This Island lying in the _Mexican_ Bay, in twenty Degrees of Northern
Latitude, _Vesputius_ left on his Starboard, and Sail’d along a
Meandring Coast (which he always kept in sight) eight hundred and sixty
Leagues, and at last entred a Haven, the like whereof he had not seen
before. Here he spent a Moneth in repairing his Ships, to which the
Inhabitants freely gave their assistance; and among other things
complain’d, that a salvage People came yearly thither from an Island
about a hundred Leagues distant, who fell upon them with horrible rage,
and whomsoever they took they eat, but first inflicted all manner of
tortures upon them, sparing none, but together murthering aged People
and sucking Infants; wherefore they crav’d assistance to be reveng’d,
which if the _Spaniards_ would grant, they would follow the Fleet with
their Boats. _Vesputius_ promis’d his aid to destroy such a
blood-thirsty People; and to assure them that he would perform his Word,
he order’d seven of them to go in _Canoos_ before and shew them the Way.
On the seventh day they came to an Anchor before the Island _Hy_, where
the Shore was guarded with naked Men, whose Bodies being strong and
brawny, were painted, and their Arms, Legs, and Head, adorn’d with
divers colour’d Plumes, having not onely offensive Weapons, as Bowes,
Arrows, and Launces, but also defensive, huge Targets, and square
Shields. So soon as they judg’d the approaching _Spaniards_ to be within
reach, they shot a great flight of Arrows at them; but _Vesputius_ lying
close along the Shore with his Ships, fir’d upon them with Chain-shot,
which did great execution: yet notwithstanding about forty _Spaniards_
leaping ashore out of their Boats, found themselves in no small danger;
for the Cannibals upon the sound of Horns flocking together, so press’d
upon them that they were forc’d to lay aside their Guns, and fall to
Blows, and had not timely assistance come to them, they had undoubtedly
been all slain: two hours the Victory was doubtful on whose side it
would fall; yet at last the Cannibals quitting the Field, left the
_Spaniards_ Victors; who the next day pursu’d their gotten Victory with
such success, that they drove their Enemies before them, burnt their
Villages and Boats, and carry’d two hundred and two and twenty of them
Prisoners to _Spain_, where they safely arriv’d the 15. of _November,
Anno 1498._

[Sidenote: _Vesputius_ Second Expedition.]

This good success so encourag’d _Vesputius_, that having stay’d scarce
seven Moneths ashore, he obtaining the Command over six Ships, with
which he set Sail from _Cadiz_, and touching upon the _Canaries_,
Steer’d from thence Southerly; and having Sail’d five hundred Leagues,
he discover’d a Countrey overflow’d and made Marishy by great Rivers,
and abounding with Trees, but saw no sign of any Inhabitants; yet not
long after, coming before an Island, he took a Boat with two Prisoners,
newly guelt, and sent as a Present to feast the _Cannibals_, which
refus’d to Treat on any other account whatsoever; wherefore he Sail’d
eighty Leagues forward along the Shore of an unknown Island, where he
Barter’d for some Gold, and got five hundred Pearls for one single
Shell; these Pearls the Inhabitants said were not found there, but taken
from their Neighboring Enemies, which liv’d Westward, and had abundance
of them.

[Sidenote: Strange constitution of a salvage people.]

Nothing worthy of remark happen’d in this Voyage, onely the strange
constitutions of a wild People, living on a barren Isle, deserve to be
mention’d.

About their Necks hung two hollow Vessels, the one full of white stamp’d
Worts, and Herbs; and the other, full of Grass, which they greedily
cram’d into their Mouths, feeding like Cattel; then a Stick wetted with
Spittle, they put into the bruis’d Herbs, taking upon the end of it, as
upon the point of a Knife, some of the bruis’d to their Mouths, which
(as if chawing the Cud) turning therein, then taking out again, and
strowing more of the same Herbs out of the Vessel upon it, swallow’d it
down. No fresh Water was to be had amongst them, but what they gather’d
from the Dew in great Leaves: Neither had they any Houses, but dwelt
under great Trees, and fed on dry’d Fish.

[Sidenote: Strange adventure of nine _Spaniards_, meeting with great
           Giants.]

The next remark in this Voyage, was the discovery of an Island not far
from the former, where he found the Footsteps of a Gigantick People,
upon which nine _Spaniards_ went a League to search the Countrey, where
they saw five great Huts, standing in a spacious Valley, and in them two
old, and three young Women, each of them being twice as tall as an
ordinary Man: The old ones invited the _Spaniards_ to eat, who when they
were sat down, consulting how they might take and carry one of these
Giantesses to _Spain_, there to shew her for Money, thirty six Giants
came in to them, (never did the Sun shine on a more terrible People)
which so amaz’d the _Spaniards_, that their Hair seem’d to stand an end
at the fear thereof: Every Giant was arm’d with a Bow and Arrows, and a
Club: They wondering at the nine strangers, stood talking very earnestly
one to another, which gave the _Spaniards_ time to think of making their
escape; some judg’d it convenient to discharge their Guns upon them, and
in the Smoke to run away; others thought, that it would be better to
take a milder course, which they all agreed on; and taking their leave,
went out of the Hut, but were follow’d by the Giants, who kept a Stones
cast behind them, and went faster or slower, as the _Spaniards_
slacken’d or mended their pace; who at last getting to the Shore, and
from thence into their Boats, they suddenly put off; but the Giants then
pursu’d them with eager speed, all of them leaping into the Water, and
Swimming, shot abundance of Arrows after them; but frighted by the
Thunder of two great Guns that were discharged from the Ships, return’d
ashore, and fled into the neighboring Hills.

[Sidenote: Description of the Pearl-Oysters.]

[Sidenote: _Vesputius_ third Expedition.]

_Vesputius_ at last began to consider of returning home, his Provisions
beginning to grow scarce, and his Sea-men faint, having continu’d in the
Equinoctial heats a whole year; wherefore he directed his course towards
_Spain_, in his Voyage, driving along the Coast an advantagious Trade,
by bartering Shells and Glass for Pearls. The Inhabitants presented him
with Oysters, of which some inclos’d one hundred and thirty Pearls; when
they attain to their full growth, they fall out of the Shells
themselves, but those that stick, decay. So upon the tenth of
_November_, the Fleet came safe to an Anchor before _Cadiz_. After
which, _Vesputius_ retired to _Sevil_, with intent to settle himself
there, but he had not long repos’d, when _Emanuel_ King of _Portugal_
sent for him to _Lisbon_, and gave him the Command of three Ships, to
discover new Countreys; between the _Canaries_ and _Africa_, they pass’d
thorow so many Fishes (not unlike a Bream) that in an hours time they
loaded their Boats with them; this Fish hath a round thin Scale, sharp
Teeth, Stones in their Brains or Foreheads, a sharp pointed Heart, a
Bladder full of Wind, red Tail and Fins, feeds on Sea Weeds, Gurnets and
Oysters, and is of a delicious Taste.

[Sidenote: Cruel deed of some _Indian_ Women.]

From thence, five degrees Southward of the Equinox, he found a naked
People on the top of a high Rock, that beckon’d the _Spaniards_ to come
towards them; upon which, two of them resolv’d to venture thither,
having order not to stay at the most above five days: The first
incounter they had was of some Women, who offer’d their bodies to
prostitution; but a Youth, as if affrighted with some sudden danger,
came running amongst them, whom, whilst they stood gazing upon, and
wondering at, an old Woman with a great Club, running down the Hill
overtook, and knock’d him down dead upon the ground; which done, the
Women that were making Court to the _Spaniards_, took him by the Heels,
and dragg’d up the Hill, where soon after they saw him chop’d in pieces,
Broyl’d, and eaten: They also made signs to the _Spaniards_, that they
would devour them also in the same manner. The Shore was crouded with
Men, which showr’d upon them several flights of Arrows; wherefore they
thought it best to Weigh Anchor, so taking Aboard their two Men, and
having Sail’d 150. Leagues, they got sight of the Coast of _Brasile_,
along which he Sail’d Southerly to fifty two Degrees, where three
_Brasilians_ came Aboard of their own accord, and were easily perswaded
to go with him to _Portugal_; but the Weather growing very bad, and the
Cold intollerable, the Storms swelling the Waves into the bigness of
Mountains, _Vesputius_ left the Coast _des Patagones_, and the
_Streights_, afterwards call’d _Magellan_, behind him, burnt one of his
Ships before _Cape Sierra Leona_, and brought two safe to _Lisbon_.

[Sidenote: _Vesputius_ fourth Expedition.]

[Sidenote: Sea-Spiders, and Dragons.]

His fourth Expedition happen’d, _May 10. Anno 1503._ at which time he
Steer’d directly with six Sail to _Sierra Leona_, and approaching the
Coast, could not come to an Anchor, because of the strong eddying
Currents: Three Degrees beyond the Equinox appear’d a rising Island, two
Leagues long, and one broad, destitute of Inhabitants; his best Ship
being six hundred Tun, split here against a Rock, and nothing of her was
saved, but the Sea-men: But _Vesputius_ Rowing ashore with a Boat, found
a convenient Haven, with abundance of sweet Water, high Trees,
Sea-Spiders, and horrible Dragons, which have a sharp Head, round fiery
Eyes, and wide Mouths, Wings not unlike a Bats, a speckled Breast,
curl’d Tail, blew Back, and two Bags like a drawn Satchel Triangular,
were under their Bellies: No less strange are the Sea-Spiders, by their
hard Feet, long upper Teeth, two long Sheers or Pinchers, and double
Belly; between the Head and the Belly lies a black Skin, with which they
darken the Water; when any one goes to take them in the night, they make
a great shadow; they feed on Fish, the Female lays little white Eggs,
not unlike ordinary Hail-stones.

_Vesputius_ having left this desolate Isle, three hundred Leagues a
Stern, enter’d a Haven, to which he gave the name of St. _Abdy_, where
he stay’d two Months, expecting the return of those which he had sent
into the Countrey; but seeing it in vain to wait any longer, he
proceeded on his Journey, and Sailing in between the _Abrelhos_, in the
River _Curubabo_, he built a strong Fort, Garrison’d it with twenty four
Men, twelve pieces of Ordnance, and Provisions for six Moneths: Five
Moneths _Vesputius_ had spent in the building this Castle; when he
return’d home with one Ship, laden with _Brasill_ Wood, where
approaching _Lisbon_, beyond all expectation, the Inhabitants of the
City ran to Congratulate his happy return. And from this _Americus
Vesputius_, the _New World_ is to this day call’d _America_.


                               SECT. VII.
  _The Expedition of_ Alphonso, Fogeda, Diego Nicuesa, Ancisus, _and_
                          Roderick Colmenares.

[Sidenote: Wonderful Tree on _Codego_.]

_Americus Vesputius_ was scarce fitted out in _Lisbon_, when _Fogeda_
set Sail with three hundred Men from _Beata_, the chiefest Haven of
_Hispaniola_, to the Island _Codego_, inhabited by Naked People, but of
comely Personage, and withal expert and most excellent Archers: Here he
found a very strange Tree, which bears a Fruit not unpleasing to the
Palate, yet deadly Poyson, and besides, whoever chances to sleep under
their shadow, loose both their understanding and Eye-sight, and never
attain to their former Sences, except they take some _Opiates_, as
dangerous, and so by long sleep, recover.

[Sidenote: _Fogedo_’s cruelty and destruction.]

[Sidenote: Famine.]

[Sidenote: Strange accident.]

[Sidenote: _Ancisus_ escapes great danger.]

[Sidenote: _Colmenares_ Expedition.]

[Sidenote: His strange reception.]

Here _Fogeda_ set upon a poor Village near the Sea-side, where without
mercy he put them all to the Sword, except a few Youths which were onely
saved, that they might inform _Fogeda_, what was become of the slain and
taken _Spaniards_; Who told him, that according to their Custom, they
had Roasted the dead, and also their living Prisoners, and feasted on
their Flesh. Here having burnt the Houses, and sifting the Ashes,
_Nicuesa_ found some Gold. But now they began to be distress’d for
Provisions; for prevention of which, _Nicuesa_ had given order to
_Ancisus_, Marshal in _Hispaniola_, that he should follow with a Ship of
Victual, for the Army to _Codega_. But he being kept back by
inconveniencies, most of the _Spaniards_ were famish’d, so that the
three hundred Men which _Codega_ brought from _Hispaniola_, were reduced
to sixty. And he was already under-Sail to _Hispaniola_, when _Ancisus_
Anchor’d in the Haven of _Codegoos_, and sent some Men ashore to mend
his Boat, and fetch fresh Water, which whilst they were doing, the
Natives came flocking about them: Three days they fac’d one another,
using no Hostility, when at last a _Spaniard_ that understood the
_Codegan_ Tongue, adventuring to fetch Water, he was immediately
encompassed; when speaking to them, and informing them in their own
Language, That he was none of _Fogedas_ or _Nicuesas_ People, which not
long since had committed so great slaughter, they left him, and the
rather, because he told them, that _Ancisus_ would take revenge on them,
if they did any wrong to him. Thus quieted, they brought all sorts of
Provisions Aboard. Mean while, _Ancisus_ Sail’d to the Main Continent
_Uraba_, where in the Mouth of a Haven he ran his Vessel aground, which
was bilg’d; the Sea-men taking some Arms along with them, sav’d their
lives by swimming ashore; where, their first sustenance they found was
store of Peaches and Cherries, which was a great refreshment in those
hot Countreys, but yet had undoubtedly been starv’d, but that in
searching the Wood for Fruits, they found Wild-Swine, which preserv’d
their lives; yet they were not free from apparent danger, having to deal
with a Salvage People, into whose hands they were so unfortunately cast
by Shipwrack; however _Ancisus_ set a good face on the business,
marching with a hundred Men up into the Countrey, where some of the
_Urabanners_ from an ambuscade unawares, with their Arrows wounded
several of his Men, hereupon they retreated to the Shore of the River
_Daria_, whither also they had brought the small Boats, sav’d from the
Wreck; where whilst they were in consultation how to return to
_Hispaniola_, the Inhabitants having muster’d themselves, and making a
Body of five hundred Men, set upon them, who after a sharp Conflict,
made them retreat, and at last to flie, whom _Ancisus_ pursuing, found
in a Thicket of Canes or Reeds a great Treasure of Gold. Mean while,
_Nicuesa_ Sail’d to the plentiful Golden Countrey _Veragua_ with three
Ships, of which he lost two, the one Commanded by _Lupus de Olana_, and
the other by _Peter Umbria Olana_, which was stranded in the River
_Veragua_, which gives name to the whole Island, but he built a new
_Carvil_, whereas that of _Lupus Olana_ was bilg’d among the Rocks.
Little better success had _Nicuesa_, whose Ship over-turning with a
Tempest, he with a few of his Men made land upon _Veragua_, where he
rang’d up and down in a miserable condition, on a barren, and in a
manner desolate Shore seventy days: All that time, finding no other Food
than Wild Roots, who wandring up and down, at last met with _Olana_, a
little before cast away on the same Isle, whom he secur’d, because he
presum’d to usurp the Title, and be prime Commander of that Countrey.
Upon which, the _Spaniards_ being divided, some for _Ancisus_, some for
_Olana_, the difference more and more encreasing, would not be
reconcil’d, till the Famine over-powering, master’d both, so that not
being able to handle their Arms, the Salvages flew them at their
pleasure, by this means in a short time, of seven hundred eighty five,
remain’d scarce ninety; yet did not all this misery work any thing upon
the ambitious humor of _Vasques Nunnez_, who rebelling against
_Ancisus_, split that small remainder of Men, and with the help of those
he had drawn over to his Party, made himself Governor of _Uraba_, not
possible to be long enjoy’d without speedy supply, which soon after they
receiv’d; for _Colmenares_ Sailing from _Hispaniola_ with Provisions,
arriv’d there the 15. of _October, Anno 1510_. having been toss’d twenty
three days at Sea; then making into the River _Gaira_, to furnish
himself with fresh Water, he lost forty seven Men; for whilst they were
filling their Casks, seven hundred of the Salvages came down upon them,
and with their Poyson’d Arrows wounded and kill’d most of them.
_Colmenares_ came in a good time to the remainder under _Ancisus_
Command, being in danger of death for want of Provisions, and finding
the factions that were among them about Superiority, he thought it fit,
consulting with some of the chiefest of them, to find out _Nicuesa_, who
was indeed the Governor that had the Grant from the King: This agreed,
_Colmenares_ went to search, and at last lighted upon him, building a
Fortress against the assaults of the Enemies on the Promontory.
_Mormor_, he was glad to find him, but griev’d to see the misery and
hardship they endur’d, most of his Men being kill’d, partly by the
excessive Heats, partly by Famine, and partly by the cruelty of the
Natives, so that he had onely sixty remaining, and those many of them
also sick and weak.

_Colmenares_ having deliver’d his Message, _Nicuesa_ broke up his
Quarters, and sleighting the Fort, went with him, but both himself and
his Men were oppos’d from Landing by _Nunnez_; wherefore _Nicuesa_ was
necessitated to Steer for _Hispaniola_; whom, or what became of him was
never known.

_Nunnez_ having thus quitted himself of _Nicuesa_, and now, more than
ever, wanting Provision, he resolv’d to take out his own Commission at
large, and setting up for himself, make no discrimination of Persons,
_Spaniards_, or Natives, but to make out his Fortune.

And first, he fell upon _Careta_ King of _Coita_, whom he took Prisoner,
Plundering him of all his Treasure and Provisions; yet this sufficed not
long, for soon after, King _Poncha_ invading _Careta_, _Nunnez_ took
hold of that opportunity, and pretending to assist _Careta_, being well
recruited with his Forces, set upon _Poncha_, who immediately fled, and
left all to the spoil of his Enemies.

[Sidenote: Remarkable Pallace of King _Comogrus_.]

This News so amaz’d _Comogrus_, another King, that he proffer’d Peace;
whereupon _Nunnez_ going thither, was nobly entertain’d in his Palace,
being one hundred and fifty Paces long, and eighty broad, the Floors
Pav’d with Stone, and the Roofs Vaulted, his Cellars were stor’d with
Wine, made of the Root _Jucca_, _Ages_, and _Mais_; the Privy-Chamber
was hung round with dead bodies, Mummy’d artificially with Lent Fires,
and were the Corpses of _Comogrus_ Ancestors, and others of the Royal
Blood, and nearest Relations, of whom some dy’d at least four hundred
years before; each of these fasten’d by Cordage made of Reeds, were
Habited in Cotton, richly adorn’d with Pearls and Gold. Mean while, a
Hurricane happening, terrible with Thunder and Lightning, and hideous
Gusts, swell’d and so enrag’d the Sea, that breaking its bounds,
over-running, drown’d the whole Champain; thus the hopes of a fruitful
Harvest being utterly lost, they suffer’d under a great Famine.

[Sidenote: _Nunnez_ Exploits.]

The _Spaniards_ which Encamp’d near the River _Daria_, on _Uraba_,
perceiving this, and knowing they had no manner of supply from
_Hispaniola_, and having already Pillag’d the Neighboring Kings, that
they had nothing left. _Nunnez_ marching thirty Leagues up the River,
Plunder’d the Village, of which _Daibaiba_ was King, where he found an
unvaluable quantity of Gold, but little or no Provision. Here were many
Flitter Mice, or Bats, bigger than Turtle Doves, whose biting was
mortal, unless immediately wash’d with Salt Water, according to the
information of the Prisoners.

Now as _Nunnez Uraba_ Pillag’d towards the South, so did _Colmenares_,
setting up also for himself, make prize of all, to the East with sixty
Men, Rowing against the Stream up the River _Daria_, above twelve
Leagues, where he found in several Villages and Hamlets, and at King
_Turvi_’s Palace, abundance, both of Provision and Gold; from thence he
March’d to the mighty Province _Abenamchei_, which though making some
resistance, at last they subdu’d.

[Sidenote: A strange Pallace built on Trees.]

[Sidenote: Turning the low Land into a Sea.]

[Sidenote: A Plot on the _Spaniards_, strangely discover’d.]

And the neighboring King _Abibeiba_ narrowly escap’d the like fortune,
whose Pallace was built on the tops of Trees, Plash’d, and Pleited
together, Timber Beams lying athwart; necessity forcing them to choose
such high Habitations, partly to avoid the Inundations of Rivers, swoln
above their bounds by sudden and almost assiduous Showres from the
Mountains; and partly, to be free from the excursions of sculking
Robbers; also being better able to defend themselves in these Castles in
the Air, and also secur’d by their heighth from their Shot, being above
the reach of their _Indian_ Arrows: The bodies of the Trees downwards,
upon which the Houses are built, are generally twenty four Fathom thick,
so that they cannot easily be cut down, nor fired; but _Colmenares_
against these, as they suppos’d, impregnable Forts, having made a
Gallery with several great Hurdles, set his Men to work under that
safeguard, with Axes on the Tree whereon _Abibeiba_’s House stood, who
seeing his imminent danger, wondring at this new manner of Storming,
came down, promising to furnish him with Gold out of the neighboring
Mountains, notwithstanding it would be with the danger of his Life;
because the _Cannibals_ generally kill those that adventur’d to dig in
the Mines: To this promise, _Colmenares_ hearken’d, and having set him
at liberty, for the performance, he in stead thereof, on the contrary,
stirr’d up, and joyn’d with all the Conquer’d Kings, to destroy him and
his Men: Nor were they slack to have executed their design, five
thousand of them being already drawn together at the Village _Tirichi_,
the appointed place of Rendezvous, and so privately carry’d, that
undoubtedly it had been effected, if not happily discover’d by this
accident.

_Nunnez_, amongst his other Slavesses, had one exceeding beautiful, on
which he was much Enamour’d, and she likewise seem’d to bear as great an
affection towards him, which she manifested, by declaring the secret to
_Nunnez_ which her Brother had imparted to her, being an intended
general Massacre the night following, that so she might the better make
her escape the day before; yet so much she prefer’d the safety of her
Lover, before the liberty of her Native Countrey, that she discover’d
the Plot. _Nunnez_ not sleeping on this advice, on a sudden set so
fiercely upon the Conspirators, that he utterly broke their design; yet
the Feuds and Contests for Superiority still continu’d amongst them,
which look’d with so bad a Face to the ruine of all, that news thereof
arriving in _Spain_, it was judg’d fit to send for _Colmenares_, and
_John Quicedo_ to the Court, there to render an account of all their
Transactions, Both going Aboard a small Vessel, were by Storm driven on
the Coast of _Cuba_, where they were inform’d from a Prisoner, that
_Valdivia_ and _Zamudio_, driven ashore by Shipwrack, and not able to
defend themselves, were surpriz’d by the Natives, kill’d and eaten; that
_Fogeda_ driven up and down along the Coast, had lost most of his People
by hunger, and other hardship, and himself with much ado getting to
_Hispaniola_, dy’d as soon as Landed of the Wound which he receiv’d by a
Poysonous Arrow, near the River _Daria_.

[Sidenote: _Ancisus_ Voyage.]

[Sidenote: A Temple dedicated to the Virgin _Mary_ on the Island
           _Cuba_.]

But much happier was _Ancisus_, who soon after _Fogeda_ coming to
_Cuba_, found a King, who suffer’d himself to be Christen’d, and call’d
_Commendator_; and building a Church, Consecrated it to the Virgin
_Mary_; in it he erected an Image of Clay, resembling a Woman, which he
clothed in a Cotton Garment; round about were plac’d Pots with Meat and
Water, according to their old Idolatrous fashion, otherwise, they
believ’d their Idols would devour the Souls of the Dead, and this,
though Christians, they did not forget.

Nay further, when he went to War, he carry’d the Image of the Virgin
_Mary_ with him in the Front of his Army, often saying, _Ave Maria_; and
this was the end of that Voyage: But afterwards _Ancisus_ complain’d
against _Vascus Nunnez_ in the _Spanish_ Court, where he receiv’d a
Sentence very prejudicial to him. _Colmenares_ and _Quicedo_ had also
Audience there, whereupon matters being settled, a firm Government was
establish’d in _Uraba_.


                              SECT. VIII.
Peter Arias _his Expedition, and remarkable Passages of_ Vascus Nunnez.

[Sidenote: _Nicuesa_ suffers hunger.]

_Peter Arias_ Knight, accompany’d with his Wife, _Elizabeth Boadilla_,
set Sail _Anno 1514._ but surpriz’d by a violent Storm, lost two Ships,
and return’d to _Spain_, yet not long after began his Voyage afresh,
notwithstanding he had lately had such bad success, and heard of the
great hardship which _Nicuesa_ suffer’d, having not onely kept himself
alive a considerable time by feeding on flesh of Dogs, and other such
like Creatures; a great Frog being sold in _Veragua_ for a lump of Gold.

[Sidenote: Dogs us’d in the Wars.]

[Sidenote: Sodomy horribly punish’d.]

[Sidenote: _Nunnez_ first discovers the South Sea.]

[Sidenote: Is in great danger on the South-Sea.]

But _Vaschus Nunnez_ inform’d of _Arias_ arrival, the chief Governor of
_Uraba_, afterwards call’d _New Andaluzia_, minding to inrich himself
before he should depose him, and hearing that several Gold Mines lay
Southward from _Uraba_, march’d thither with a hundred and ninety Men,
thorow great Rivers, Thickets, and Woods full of Wild Beasts, deep
Vallies, and broad Rivers, not without many hazards and difficulties. In
the Mountainous Territory _Quarequan_, the Inhabitants ingag’d him
valiantly, with Bows, Arrows, Clubs, Woodden Swords, Pikes and Launces,
but frighted with the meer report of their Musquets, like flocks of wild
Fowl, dissipated and fled, but not so fast, but that six hundred of them
fell by the hands of the _Spaniards_, or were worry’d by their Dogs,
train’d up on purpose for the _American_ Wars. Soon after, coming into
the Palace, there sate his Brother dress’d up in Womens Apparel, whom
the King kept to abuse, as if a Concubine, whereof _Nunnez_ being
inform’d, in detestation of Sodomy, set the Dogs upon him, who suddenly
tore him in pieces. Amongst the slain were found several _Negroes_,
which suffering Shipwrack had been cast on the _American_ Shore, and
maintain’d a continual War with the _Quaraquanen_, so that it seem’d the
_Blacks_ which were found dead amongst them were their Slaves: Yet
_Nunnez_ was forc’d to leave a considerable number of his Men here, who
being half starv’d, and quite tired out, were not able to follow him;
but with the remaining party he march’d on, and at last came to the high
Mountains, from whence he saw the great South-Sea, and going thither,
was met by King _Chiapes_, leading an Army of thirty thousand Men, which
great Body stood not long to make resistance, being terrifi’d with the
Vollyes of Shot, whose Report the ecchoing Valleys presented to their
Ears, double and trebble: And that which most amaz’d and disanimated
them in the rout, were the Dogs, who fiercely pursu’d and seiz’d the
flyers, tearing away great morsels of Flesh. After the Battel, the
Conqueror proffer’d Peace, which was agreed on, upon the delivery of
several great Presents of Gold. After that, _Chiapes_ the King,
accompany’d with _Nunnez_ the _Spanish_ Commander, and March’d with him
over a broad River to _Coquera_, where at first some Forces made
resistance, but were routed; whereupon, they also suddenly struck up a
Peace, upon conditions, that the Prince, nam’d also _Coquera_, should
return him a great quantity of Gold. Here he found a handsome Bay
running up in crooked Reaches, above sixty Leagues, which _Nunnez_
call’d St. _Michael_, being sprinkled with Islands, and treacherous with
hidden Rocks. There _Nunnez_, (though disswaded by _Chiapes_, because he
knew the South-Sea at that time being the three last Moneths of the
Year, was exceeding turbulent, that no Vessel could hardly live in it,
yet) ventur’d with nine _Indian_ Boats, and eighty Men from the Shore
into the _Offin_; where, notwithstanding the high rolling of the Waves,
he got to an uninhabited Island, on which, being necessitated to stay a
night, the Tide flow’d so much, according to the property of the
South-Sea, that the highest Ground thereon, lay almost cover’d with
Water, every one of the _Spaniards_ having enough to do to save
themselves from being wash’d away. Day approaching, discover’d a second
inconveniency, for the _Indian_ _Canoos_ either were extremely Leaky, or
else so shatter’d, that they were unfit for service; yet notwithstanding
all this, they ventur’d to return, rather choosing to be devour’d in the
Waves, than die of that hunger, whose misery they had sufficiently
tasted, during the small time they had been out. Not long after,
_Nunnez_ Conquer’d the King _Tamaccus_ in a Field Battel, who thereupon
purchas’d his Peace with great Presents of Gold and Pearl. He also
shew’d the _Spaniards_ an Island, whose spiring tops were seen from the
Main Land, which so abounded in Pearls, that in no place were either
more or fairer to be found: But the King who liv’d on it was exceeding
powerful.

[Illustration]

[Sidenote: Manner of Fishing for Pearls.]

_Nunnez_ immediately resolv’d to Sail thither, notwithstanding it was
the middle of _October_, when the South-East Winds make such a turbulent
and hollow Sea, as many times wash’d away Trees and pieces of Rocks:
Besides, the Weather was more terrible, by continual Lightning and great
Thunder-Claps; the Nights very cold, the Days exceeding hot; yet all
these difficulties could not prevail, for _Nunnez_ would not stay to
expect fairer Weather, but went on, and coming thither, he saw how the
_Indians_ Fish for Pearls, which was Diving for Oysters; but the Weather
being rough and foul, they durst not venture for the best which lay far
from the Shore.

[Sidenote: _Nunnez_ returns.]

But _Nunnez_ leaving his sick and weary’d Men with _Chiapes_, March’d
quite another way back than he came; and crossing a great River, was
receiv’d by Prince _Teaocha_, who furnish’d him with Gold, Pearls,
Provisions, and Guides, which carry’d his Luggage and Goods.

[Sidenote: _Pacra_ a tyrannous King, his horrible death.]

_Pacra_, a great Oppressor of all his Neighbors, hearing of the approach
of _Nunnez_, fled, but terrifi’d with threats, return’d with three other
Princes, which were all so Deform’d, that more horrible Monsters were
never seen, scarce any part about them resembling those of a Man: The
Guides which _Teaocha_ had provided for the _Spaniard_ desir’d that he
might be put to Death, for the Cruelties which he had long committed;
whose Request being granted, he with the other three Princes, were given
as a Breakfast to the _Spanish_ Doggs. Mean while, the _Spaniards_ were
in danger to have perish’d for want of Water; yet at last, in a Thicket
of Brambles, they found a small Brook, but none of the _Indians_ durst
venture to go to it, for fear of Tygers, and other Wild Beasts;
relating, That the Tygers took many people in the nights out of their
Huts, if they were not careful in making fast their Doors.

[Sidenote: Strange relations of a Tyger.]

_John Ledesma_ had himself eaten part of a Tyger, which for six Moneths
together, had every night feasted on Mans flesh, or Beasts, which they
caught in this manner: In the Path along which he pass’d, coming out of
his Den to seek for Prey, a deep Pit was digg’d, and cover’d very
sleightly on the top, into which the Tyger fell; yet though taken, so
fiercely withstood the Pikes, Darts, and Stones thrown at him, that
every one was amaz’d to see the fury of the Beast. After that they
sought for the Female, but found onely two young ones without a Dam,
which taking along with them, they put Iron Collars about their Necks,
intending to carry them to _Spain_; but seeing no likelyhood of breeding
them up, they brought them back again, purposing to fetch them away when
grown somewhat older, and accordingly coming afterwards to look for
them, they found the Den empty, so that it was supposed they had been
devour’d by their Dam.

[Sidenote: _Nunnez_ further Journey into the Countrey, very remarkable.]

In the Province of _Bononiama_, the _Spaniards_ inrich’d themselves with
Chains, and Breast-Plates of Gold, which in great plenty hung on the
Walls in every House: At the River _Comogrus_, they discharg’d
_Teaocha_’s Guides, and made use of _Cotog_ and _Ciuriza_, two Governors
of a barren Tract of Land, full of Hills and Mountains, which they left
on their right Hand, and wandred three days over a _Morasse_, in which
they often sunk to their Knees.

In all these Travels, Victual was so scarce that they were much weaken’d
by their wants; and though they took fresh courage when they got footing
on King _Buchebua_’s Jurisdiction, yet they found nothing but empty
Huts; and the like in the Countrey of _Chiorisus_, both having a little
before been pillag’d by their more powerful neighboring Enemies. But
although they could not furnish _Nunnez_ with Provisions, they presented
him with weighty Ingots of Gold: but this rich Metal not able to
purchase the least morsel of Bread, drove them into a great strait; and
indeed they had without doubt been all famished, had not _Pocchorosa_,
another King, fed them forty days together with stamp’d Roots. Thus
refresh’d, and instigated by _Pocchorosa_, they broke by night in
_Tubunama_’s Palace, and took him Prisoner with eighty Concubines, who
fearing to be put to death, gave an incredible Treasure of Gold to
purchase his Ransom.

_Nunnez_ thus enriched came at last to his People which he had left on
the River _Daria_, where two Ships sent from _Hispaniola_ rode at an
Anchor.

[Sidenote: _Peter Arias_ his Voyage, and Fight in the Haven _St.
           Martha_.]

Whilst things were thus carry’d in _America_, _Peter Arias_ Sail’d with
fifteen Ships, Mann’d with fifteen hundred Men, to _New Andalusia_, by
the Islands _Martinina_, _Guadalupe_, and _Galanta_, all in _America_: a
considerable time he Sail’d through the Sea overgrown with Weeds.
Afterwards anchoring in the Haven _St. Martha_, he receiv’d a great
repulse from the Natives, who no ways daunted at the bigness of the
Ships, waded up to their Breasts in the Sea, and shot many great flights
of poisonous Arrows at the _Spaniards_, or whom two being wounded
immediately died. _Arias_ sending some of his Men ashore, they found
many Boats lying full of Nets, made of tough Weeds, and Ropes pleited of
Rushes.

In the Haven _St. Martha_, being three Leagues wide, are abundance of
Fish, which may be seen under Water twenty Fathom deep.

But now the _Spaniards_ that were ashore breaking into the Houses, and
taking Women and Children Prisoners, the _Americans_ prepar’d for
another Fight, which at the beginning was very fierce; but at last they
were forc’d to quit the Field.

[Sidenote: Strange Houses and Houshold-stuff.]

Their Houses and Furniture in them are worthy of observation: their
Cielings being cover’d with Shells strung on small Thred, which make a
pleasing noise, when mov’d by the least breath of Wind. The Walls are
hung with fine Stuffs, woven full of Imagery, as Cranes, Lyons, Tygers,
and some Figures of Men; the Floors are cover’d with parti-colour’d
Mats, made of Sea-Reeds, and several tough Roots; and their Carpets
beset with Pearl add also a great beauty to their Rooms.

In the Valleys the _Spaniards_ found several precious Jems, as Saphires,
Jasper, Emeralds, and great pieces of Amber, and in some Huts, Baskets,
and Chests full of dry’d Locusts, and Crabs.

Here also grows the Root _Yuca_, as also on several other _West-Indian_
Coasts, of which they make their best Bread, and is call’d in
_Hispaniola_ and _Angola_, _Yuca_; by the _Brasilians_, _Mandiba_ and
_Mandihoka_; by the _Mexicans_, _Quauhcamotli_: it grows with a thick or
midling Body, according to the fruitfulness or barrenness of the Soil;
the Leaves are like those of a Tulip, and have small Flowers and Seed,
but no ways useful; the Root, not unlike Horse-Raddish, hath a milky
Juice, which swells it exceedingly; the Sprigs, which in the eighth and
tenth Moneth shoot out of the Root, serve for new Plants; and if at any
time it happen, that either by a moist Season, or by Worms, or Pismires,
the Plant is spoil’d, then it occasions such an inconvenience amongst
the Inhabitants, that half of them in that year die of Famine.

[Sidenote: What use the _Americans_ make of the Root _Mandihoka_.]

The Leaves of the _Mandihoka_ serve them for Sallads. Out of the Root,
which they lay soaking five days in Water, they make Meal, which the
_Portuguese_ call _Farina fresca_, but the _Americans_, _Vipeba_.
Moreover, _Mandihoka_ serves them to make Bread, which they bake over
the Fire; and mix’d with Water, Pepper, and the Flour _Nhambi_, makes an
excellent Pudding, by them call’d _Mingaude Carima_, no less pleasing to
the taste than wholsom Food: and with Orange-Flour, Water, and Sugar, it
makes that excellent Julep _Tipioca_. The Powder of _Mandihoka_ put into
a Wound, cures very speedily. It is very pleasant to see the _Americans_
eat this Bread; for they toss it by handfuls at a pretty distance from
their Mouthes without letting fall the least Crum. Lastly, it requires
great art and trouble to make the _Mandihoka_ fit for Bread: first they
must peel off the Shell, then put into a Mill turn’d by two _Indians_ it
falls, being Ground, into a square Trough. The Juice proceeding from it
is mortal, if eaten when raw, but wholsom if boil’d: the Meal they put
in a Press, and when all the moisture is drawn from it, they strow it in
an Oven to dry. But the wild _Mandihoka_, by those that live on the
Sea-shore call’d _Cuacu Mandiiba_, and up in the Countrey,
_Cuquacucuremia_, differs both in shape and goodness from the first.

[Sidenote: _Arias_’s Exploits in _New Andalusia_.]

But to return to our matter: _Arias_ coming to an Anchor in the River
_Daria_, was cheerfully receiv’d by _Nunnez_; his first Business which
he undertook was the building of three Forts, to secure the Passages to
the _South Sea_; to which purpose _Joannes Aiora_ received the Command
over four hundred Workmen. Moreover, _Arias_ took great dislike in the
Place call’d _Maria Antiqua_, which the _Spaniards_ were forc’d by
necessity first to Plant in: it lay in a deep Valley between high
Mountains, so that it not onely wanted the benefit of the rising and
setting of the Sun, but when in or near the Meridian, it shin’d down
upon them, and scorch’d all their Plants, and the tepifi’d Morassy
Grounds about the same infected the Air, and the Water which they took
up to wash their Houses, immediately bred Frogs, the River _Daria_
overflow’d the Grounds with his muddy Water three Leagues distance from
the Sea; the Passage thither also was very troublesom, because of the
uneven Ways; and besides, the Tygers and Lyons devour’d many People and
Cattel.

[Sidenote: A strange Accident.]

The first Night that _Arias_ lay in _Maria Antiqua_, the House wherein
his Chirurgion Lodg’d was fir’d with Lightning, who running out with his
Wife, being both scorched by the Flames, saw a very great Crocodile,
which snatching up his Dog ran away with him towards the River.

[Sidenote: Remarkable Trees.]

The neighboring Territory _Coiba_ produced Trees, whose Timber us’d for
Shipping never breeds Worms, because of its acerbity; whereas on the
contrary, all other Vessels in that Countrey are very subject to that
inconvenience. Here also grow those famous Plague-Trees, whose very
Leaves, if but falling upon one, are like Gods Arrows, mortal, and
immediately kill, unless the Place whereon they light be straightway
anointed with fasting Spittle: and the _Coibensers_ say, that they know
another poysonous Wood, which they use to destroy their Enemies withall.

[Sidenote: Remarkable Journey of _Moralis_ to the _South Sea_.]

Whilst _Arias_ was consulting about the beforemention’d Affairs, he sent
several Comanders to divers Places, to take a survey, and give him an
account of their Return of all their Discoveries. Amongst others _Gasper
Moralis_ was order’d to march towards the _South Sea_, to confirm the
Peace which _Nunnez_ had begun with the Kings _Chiapes_ and _Tumaccus_;
and chiefly to go to the Pearl-Island with sixty Men, which _Nunnez_ was
forc’d to leave, being stress’d by tempestuous Weather. _Chiapes_ and
_Tumaccus_ were according to their promise, to prepare an Army ready for
his assistance against his coming; which indeed they perform’d, so that
they wanted nothing but Vessels, for the biggest of theirs could not
carry above three or four Men; yet they undertaking their Enterprise,
Landed seventy Men on the Island; upon which the Inhabitants under their
Kings Conduct ran to meet the new Landed Forces, and crying out aloud
_Guazzavara_, _Guazzavara_, they ran in amongst the Musqueteers with
their woodden Swords; but the report of the Guns, mix’d with Fire,
Smoak, and Bullets, soon amaz’d them: the King flying, thought by alarm
to raise all the Islanders; but they being inform’d, that no People
whatsoever could withstand the fire-spitting People, made Articles of
agreement with _Moralis_, and Condition’d to deliver a hundred pound
weight of the choicest Pearls to the use of the King of _Castile_; and
as a testimony of his Friendship he was Christen’d _Peter Arias_, from
the Governors Name of _New Andalusia_.

[Sidenote: Strange Pearl.]

How great the Treasure was which _Moralis_ brought from the Pearl Island
may appear by one of the Pearls, for which Pope _Leo_ the tenth gave
forty four thousand _Ducats_ to a _Venetian_ Merchant.

[Sidenote: _Solisius_ his miserable end.]

Amongst the Commanders which were sent out by _Arias_, was also
_Johannes Solisius_, who Sailing six hundred Leagues Southerly, along
the Coast of the _Caribbies_, beyond _Cape St. Augustine_, he found the
Inhabitants of _Pernambuck_ to be no less cruel than subtile; for being
invited ashore, he with some of his Men Row’d thither, where no sooner
Landing, but were all kill’d and eaten in the sight of the other Sea-men
aboard; at which being amaz’d they weighed Anchor, and Sail’d away,
Freighted onely with _Brasile_ Wood, to _Cadiz_.

Also in an unhappy hour did _Johannes Pontæus_ put some of his
Laundresses ashore on the Island _Guadalupa_, to wash some Linnen for
him; for the Islanders coming on a sudden out of the Woods surpriz’d
them, and forthwith killing without mercy, cut them in pieces, and
carbonadoing, eat their broil’d Flesh hot from the Coals, while
_Gonsalus Badajocius_ Sail’d with eighty Men Westerly, and having gone
sixty Leagues he went ashore, and spent some days in vain, to Court the
_Americans_ to a friendly correspondency; which whilst he was doing, he
was recruited with fifty Men from _Daria_, Commanded by _Lodowick
Mercado_: so both agreed together to travel over the Mountains to the
_South Sea_.

[Sidenote: Strange Slaves.]

[Sidenote: Great Booty.]

The Governor _Juana_, whose Jurisdictions abound in Gold, flying with
most part of his Treasure, was never heard of, onely they took some of
his Slaves, whose Faces were strangely Carv’d with sharp Fish-bones, the
Wounds fill’d with red and black Powder, which so discolour’d the Flesh
that it could never be got out. After that they travell’d through the
Wilderness five days together, being onely met by some _Indians_
carrying _Maiz_, who signifi’d to them, that King _Periguete_ liv’d
along the Sea-shore, and up into the Countrey the blind _Totonoga_; of
both which they got an unvaluable Treasure of Gold. Amongst other Pieces
of that rich Metal was one which weighed two pound.

_Taracura_ rais’d in this Expedition eighteen thousand weight of Gold:
and little less did they take out of the Territories belonging to the
Princes _Pananome_, _Tabor_, _Cheru_, and _Scoria_: The Prisoners serv’d
them in stead of Horses, they not being able to carry all the Gold
themselves, the meanest Soldier having above three thousand Pounds
_Sterling_ for his share.

[Sidenote: Destruction of the _Spaniards_.]

They were now got to _Panza_’s Kingdom, not without leaving sad remarks,
of their avarice and cruelties. When _Pariza_ surrounding this Party
thus loaden with Gold, Charged so fiercely, that at the first Assault
seventy of them were slain; those few that escap’d brought the tidings
of their sad misfortune to _Peter Arias_. Amongst those that escaping
return’d, was _Franciscus Delapuente_, whose observations concerning
catching Parrots and wild Fowl, we will briefly relate, the digression
being but short.

[Sidenote: A strange way to catch Parrots.]

The _Indian_ where the Parrots are most frequent climbs into a Tree, and
chattering like them, with his Voice imitating their Notes, allures his
fellow-prater to draw near, and suffer him to take them in his Hands.
But more belongs to the taking of wild Fowl, as Geese, Ducks, Swans, and
the like: From the bottom of their standing Pools and Lakes in that
Countrey grow Weeds, which spreading upon the Water ripen, and rotting
breed Water-Flies, Spiders, and Frogs, upon which the Fowls feed. Near
these Pools in the Gardens grow Cabbages as high as Trees, which often
dropping into the Water serve the Birds both for Nests and Food: but the
skilful Fowler finds it his best way to take one of these Cabbages, and
making it hollow in the middle, claps it on his Head like a Helmet, then
going into the Water up to his Chin, and passing softly along in such
manner, that nothing is seen but the floating Cabbage, and coming near
the Birds, he takes them one after another by the Legs, and puts them
into a Bag ty’d about his middle for that purpose.

[Sidenote: Strange Bird _Toucan_.]

But what is more worthy observation is the _American_ Bird _Toucan
Xochitenachate_, having a fleshy Bill, like a Mouth full of Teeth, which
continually opens and shuts to draw Breath, having no Nostrils; the
Back, Neck, and Wings, are black, the Breast yellow like Gold, the Belly
and end of the Tail of a Vermillion colour.

[Sidenote: Evacuated Pepper.]

This Bird _Toucan_ feeds for the most part on Pepper, which tarries not
long with them, but muted almost as soon as swallowed: which Pepper thus
evacuated the Natives value above their common, because the unpleasing
sharp acidity, or biting quality is thereby much mitigated.

But to return: Whilst the Expeditions under the Command of _Peter Arias_
had such bad success, _Arias_ himself and _Vaschus Nunnez_ hapned to
clash: _Nun__nez_, who since his discovery of the _South Sea_ was held
in some repute at the _Spanish_ Court, had built four Ships on the Shore
of the same Ocean, to make farther inspections along the Coasts thereof:
but being commanded to come to _Arias_ the Governor, he was committed to
Prison, and accused of high Treason, as if he had intentions to settle
himself in _Peru_, and absolutely to have left _Daria_: all which though
he disown’d, and utterly deni’d with great protestations when brought to
a Trial, and no witness to affirm the contrary, yet was by _Arias_’s
special Order Beheaded.

Not long after which _Lupus Sosa_, Governor of the _Canary_ Islands, was
sent to succeed _Arias_ in _New Andalusia_.


                               SECT. IX.
 _The Expeditions of_ Francisco Fernandez, Lupus Caizedus, Christophero
           Morantes, Bernardo Igniguez, _and_ Juan Grisalva.

[Sidenote: Original of the Name _Jucatan_.]

_Fernandez_, _Caizedus_, and _Morantes_, antient Planters in _Cuba_,
obtain’d a Licence from the Governor _Diego Velasques_, to Rig out three
Ships with a hundred and ten Men to discover new Lands. _Velasques_
thought fit to add one more to their number upon the Kings account;
which Trust he committed to _Igniguez_: all of them consulted with the
experienc’d Navigator _Antonio Alamines_. Six days the Fleet had been at
Sea, when they discover’d Land, which by a mistake was call’d _Jucatan_,
because the Inhabitants being ask’d what was the Name of the Coast,
answer’d _Jucatan_; which, as the _Spaniards_ were afterwards inform’d,
signifi’d, _We understand you not_.

[Sidenote: Stately City.]

Upon the Shore they found a City, whose Stone Buildings, with stately
Fronts and high Turrets, shew’d most magnificently. _Fernandez_ call’d
this City for its wonderful bigness, _Cairo_, from the _Egyptian_
Metropolis, famous through the World.

[Sidenote: _Campechium_ a City.]

[Sidenote: Remarkable Images, and strange Stage.]

The _Spaniards_ coming to Land were courteously receiv’d, and conducted
into the City; the neatness of whose Market-places, and exactness of
their Streets, they beheld with admiration; as also the costly Stuff
Garments both of Men and Women: but their wonder increas’d when they
beheld very artificial Crosses, concerning which upon inquiry they
related, That a Man more glorious than the Sun, being busie in erecting
the Crosses, died. But these People, though so courteous and civil at
first, seem’d in few days to be weary of their company; which the
_Spaniards_ observing sounded a Retreat, and Sailing Westerly, proceeded
on their intended Design, and soon after anchor’d before _Campechium_;
the King of which conducted _Fernandez_ and _Morantes_, with some
others, into the City, consisting of three thousand Houses. In his
Palace they were entertain’d with all manner of Fowl roasted: After
which refreshment they survey’d the City; in which, amongst other
curious Buildings, was a high, but square Theatre of Marble, on which
stood the Image of a Man, on all corners assaulted by four wild Beasts,
which were of a no less strange than horrible shape. Not far from this
Image they saw a Serpent fashion’d up of Chalk and little Stones, whose
coyl’d up Tail was forty seven Foot long, and of a proportionable
thickness. This Serpent, sprinkled with Mens Blood yet warm, seem’d to
prey upon a Marble Lyon: both these were inclos’d with a Stone Rail,
within which Malefactors were daily executed. Bloody Bows and Arrows
broke in small pieces lay between the Bones and dead Bodies. _Igniguez_
call’d the King _Lazarus_, because he discover’d his Countrey on _St.
Lazarus_’s Day.

[Illustration]

[Sidenote: _Moscobo_ a City.]

[Sidenote: _Spaniards_ slain.]

[Sidenote: Mighty Island _Cosumella_.]

Making no long stay here, they return’d to their Ship, and weighing
Anchor Sail’d fifty Leagues more Westerly, the Fleet got sight of
_Moscobo_, in the Territory _Aguanil_, whose King assaulted the
_Spaniards_ with so much fury, that two and twenty of them were slain,
and scarce one escap’d which was not wounded: wherefore they return’d
with bad success to _Cuba_. Yet _Velasques_ no ways discourag’d thereat,
not long after fitted out four Vessels, Manning them with three hundred
Men under the Command of _Juan Grisalva_ and _Alamines_; who having
Sail’d seventy Leagues, discover’d the fruitful Island _Cosumella_;
along whose Shore stood fair Stone Edifices, intermix’d with Temples,
whose Steeples appear’d above the Houses. _Grisalva_ being led up into
one of these Steeples by a Priest, saw at a distance off at Sea the
Territory _Jucatan_: and in the Place where they were, there were
spacious Halls, full of Marble and Stone Images of deformed Men and
Beasts, which with a murmuring noise, and burning of incense they
religiously worship. The _Spaniards_ call’d this Island _Sancta Cruz_.

[Sidenote: _Spaniards_ fight with the _Campechiums_.]

Sailing from hence they directed their Course to _Campechium_, where the
year before they had been so civilly treated; where arriving, and
without any fear coming ashore, they found the _Campechiums_ quite of
another humor than they were the former year, telling them, They would
not suffer any Strangers to be amongst them; and placing a burning Torch
between theirs and the _Spanish_ Forces, threatned, That if they did not
depart in quiet, they would force them: which accordingly they
endeavor’d, making a fierce Onset upon the _Spaniards_; who being now
come under their Battlements, when they saw their advantage, pour’d what
they had kept as a reserve, whole Volleys of small Shot amongst them;
which struck so much terror, that they all ran away, shifting for
themselves, and crowding into the City.

The _Spaniards_ found afterwards _Jucatan_ to be but a _Peninsula_, and
came before a River which fell with so strong a Current into the
_Mexican Sea_, that it retain’d its sweetness for the space of two
Leagues.

[Illustration]

[Sidenote: Strange passages on _Tabasco_.]

This River, flowing out of the Province _Tabasco_, was call’d
_Grisalva_: upon whose Banks stood above six thousand _Americans_; and
in the Water appear’d a hundred Boats with Armed Men, which Row’d aboard
the _Spanish_ Ships. The Interpreters of _Cuba_, whose Language agrees
for the most part with the _Tabascers_, prevail’d so much, that the King
himself came to the chief Commander _Grisalva_, and bartering with him,
gave him as much Gold as his Iron Helmet, Breastplate, and other Armor
weighed.

[Sidenote: _Sacrifice Island._]

Soon after they Landed on the _Island of Sacrifice_, so call’d from the
horrid Sacrifices which the Inhabitants made daily.

[Sidenote: Exceeding horrible Sacrifices.]

Amongst other strange Images, there flood a great Lyon of Marble,
seeming almost decollated with a great gash; into which Wound they
pour’d humane Blood warm, which was receiv’d into a Stone Trough set for
that purpose underneath; then the Figure of a Man Carv’d in Alabaster,
bowing forward, as if looking into the Trough upon the Blood. Those
which were sacrificed were Prisoners taken on the neighboring Coasts,
whom bringing before their Idols, they ripping open make no farther
inspection, but onely to whip out the Heart; with which having smear’d
the Lips of their Idols, they throw it into the Fire: the Heads and
Corps they let lie unburi’d; whose fleshy parts, especially their
Cheeks, they feast upon.

[Sidenote: _Maiden-Island._]

The next Island is inhabited by Women; to which Annually their Neighbors
go, pretending merry kindness, but upon amorous inclinations: and Plough
and Till their Ground, and Weed their Gardens.

[Sidenote: _Pontenchianum_ a City.]

The chief City of _Tabasco_ is _Pontenchianum_, and contains above
fifteen hundred Houses, all built of Stone hardned with baking after
their manner; which in some Places, besides their Turrets and Temples,
yield a pleasant Prospect at a great distance. Fourteen eminent Towns
more did the _Spaniards_ also see in _Tabasco_.

[Sidenote: Strange making of Obligations.]

When in conversing with them they observ’d their strange manner of
Sealing their Bargains and Contracts one with another, they were amaz’d,
for not using Wax, they usually Seal’d their Compacts with their own
Blood, commonly drawn with a Stone Knife, either from their Tongue,
Hand, or Arms.

Their Priests live single, and if found to be Unchast, are punisht with
Death. An Adulteress is sold for a Slave: Unmarry’d People may not
frequently converse with Marry’d: Thirty five days in the year makes
their _Lent_, in which they abstain not onely from Flesh, but Fish also,
feeding onely upon Roots and Herbs. In this place the _Spaniards_ were
receiv’d in great state, Canopy’d with green Palm-Tree-Branches, and in
like manner conducted aboard again, not without many Presents, _viz._
the Effigies of a Man curiously wrought in Gold, wherewith they return’d
to _Cuba_.


                               SECT. IXA.
 _The Expedition of_ Ferdinand Magaglian, _commonly call’d_ Magellane.

[Sidenote: Bishop _Casis_ sad effect concerning the Pearl catching.]

The Bishop _Bartholomew de Casis_, living a considerable time in
_Hispaniola_, in the City _Dominico_, being inform’d of the abundance of
Pearls which were caught before _Cubagua_, and the unsupportable cruelty
of the _Spaniards_ there under _Ocampus_, us’d against the Inhabitants,
went to _Spain_, with a design to obtain of the Emperor _Charles the
Fifth_, the Government over _Cumana_ and _Cubagua_, under pretence, to
draw the ignorant Natives from their Idolatry, to _Christianity_; which
his request was especially promoted by _William_ of _Nassaw_, the
Emperors prime Favorite; so that having his Letters Patents granted to
that purpose, he took Ship, and arriv’d with three hundred _Spanish_
Gentlemen of Quality in _Cumana_: And that they might have the greater
respect shown to them there, they had each a Red Cross given them, such
as the Knights of _Calatrava_ generally wear. Yet little did _Ocampus_,
the old Governor of _Cumana_, regard either them or their Authority; for
in stead of receiving and submitting, he kept the Bishop _de Casis_ out
by force of Arms; who then made complaint to the _Vice-Roy_ of the
_West-Indies_ in _Hispaniola_, and in the mean time, put his _Cargo_
into a new Store-house.

But whilst he made his Addresses, _Ocampus_ having sufficiently inrich’d
himself departed, which incourag’d the _Cumaners_, who already were
incens’d, and weary of their former sufferings, to venture on a design,
whereby they might revenge themselves of the _Spaniards_, which their
undertaking prov’d so successful, that very few escap’d the Massacre: Of
which, _de Casis_ being inform’d, and much discontented thereat, betook
himself to a _Dominican_ Cloyster in _Hispaniola_.

[Sidenote: Cruelty of _Castellio_ in _Cumana_.]

Yet not long after, the _Cumaners_ paid dear for that slaughter, for one
_Castellio_, though not without several Engagements, with various
success, lasting forty days together, having at last utterly vanquish’d
them, put to an ignominious Death, Hanging up seventy of their Princes,
and to them of meaner quality, shewing as little mercy.

[Sidenote: _Lampagnano_ discontented.]

As little success had _Lodowick Lampagnano_, sent out by some _Spanish_
Merchants, with Letters Patents from the Emperor to Fish for Pearl,
before the same _Cubagua_; to which purpose he carry’d peculiar Nets and
other necessaries with him. But the _Cubaguan Spaniards_ unanimously
withstood him; so that not being able to effect his design, overpower’d
with a Melancholly Distemper that broke his Heart, he dy’d.

[Sidenote: _Magellanus_ Expedition, how it happen’d.]

In the interim, while these scarce considerable Voyages turn’d to so
small account, _Ferdinand Magaglianus_ (for so _Peter Martyr_ calls him,
and not _Magellanus_, which herein deserves to be credited, because they
were intimately acquainted, and great friendship between them,)
undertook to Sail round about the World; the occasion of which we will
here relate at large:

This _Magaglianus_, or _Magellanus_, a Gentleman of _Portugal_, having
perform’d things of great importance for his King, in _Africa_, although
with no less trouble than Charge, desir’d an addition of half a Ducket a
Moneth added to his Annual Pension; an inconsiderable Sum to make a
Request for, yet though so little, was as niggardly deny’d: Whereupon,
highly incensed, he study’d no little revenge; to which effect, soon
after an opportunity was presented, by means of _Franciscus Serranus_,
who writ from _Ternata_ to him, that he should speedily come thither,
which he soon after did upon this account:

[Sidenote: Strange Giant.]

Pope _Alexander_ the Sixth, having fixt Terminaries between the Kings of
_Castile_ and _Portugal_, both busie at that time in discovering new
Countreys, Order’d, That _Castile_ should possess all the Coasts lying
to the West of the chief _Meridian_, and _Portugal_ to the East: By
vertue of this partition, the rich Spicy _Molucca_ Islands fell
absolutely to the _Portuguese_: Now _Magellanus_ perswaded _Charles the
Fifth_, that they might be Sail’d to with a Westerly Course, and
therefore belong’d to _Castile_; Which advice, _Charles the Fifth_
considering, and approving, Rigg’d out five Ships, with which
_Magellanus_ set Sail from _Sevil_, the tenth of _August, Anno 1519._
five Moneths he ply’d up and down the Coast inhabited by the
_Patagones_, where he found none but one single Person, or rather a
Monster, a Giant ten Foot high, who coming Aboard his Ship, devour’d a
great Hamper full of Biskets, and at one Draught drunk up nine Pottels
of Water. He also saw several Trees which had been Hew’n with Axes, and
Crosses made on the tops of them. Whilst he lay in that Harbor, which
was call’d _St. Julian_, he Cashier’d his Vice-Admiral, _John
Carthagena_, with his Father Confessor, and sparing their lives, set
them ashore, and there left them to seek their Fortunes, though they had
Conspir’d to Murther him.

[Sidenote: _Straights_ of _Magellan_, how found.]

_Magellanus_ from thence Sailing afterwards Southerly along _America_,
to forty two Degrees Southern Latitude, was engag’d with the eddyings of
a very strong Current, which driving one of the Ships into a Bay, split
against a blind Rock, but the Men being sav’d in their Boat, were driven
farther and farther into a Channel, between high and Snowy Mountains;
whereupon he immediately judg’d (as the famous Negromancer _Roderick
Talerus_ had often told him) that there was the Passage, through which
the Northern Ocean flow’d into the Southern; wherefore he resolutely
adventur’d to Sail into those _Sraights_, which in some places narrow,
and in others broad, is an hundred and twenty Leagues long, and full of
small Isles and dangerous Rocks. Whilst he still Sail’d on, the Ship
call’d _Antonio_, Tacking about, return’d to _Cadiz_.

But _Magellanus_ enter’d the great South-Sea with three Sail, on the 25.
of _October_, where the Sea-men suffer’d extremely by excessive Heat,
Drought, and Famine, three Moneths and twenty Days, without sight of
Land: And now, their Shooes, and the Leather which cover’d their
Shields, began also to grow scarce (which before had been counted a
Dainty) when they discover’d two Islands lying two hundred Leagues
distance one from another, yet both Desolate and Barren, wherefore they
were call’d the _Unfortunate Isles_: After that, they came amongst a
great number of Islands, whose Inhabitants were much inclin’d to
Thievery; for which cause they Denominated them _Ladrones_, the chiefest
Island call’d _Borneo_, hath two hundred fifty four Leagues in
Circumference, whereon a Tree grows, whose Leaves when faln off, seem to
be alive and creep like Worms. The King of this Island entertain’d the
_Spaniards_ very courteously, two Elephants bringing his Presents to
them on the Shore, out of a City consisting of twenty thousand Houses.

[Sidenote: _Magellanus_ slain.]

[Sidenote: _Spaniards_ murdered.]

[Sidenote: An end of the Voyage about the world.]

Near _Borneo_ are two lesser Islands, call’d, _Zubo_ and _Matan_; The
King of _Zubo_ freely submitted himself to the _Spaniards_, and
_Magellanus_ leaving his Fleet at Anchor in the Haven, went with his own
and other _Indian_ Boats, and attended with some of the _Zubensers_ to
_Matan_, where setting a Village on Fire, he carry’d great Riches from
thence: This not satisfying, he resolv’d within eight days to set upon
the Royal Head-City; but the King in his own Defence, Encountering with
_Magellanus_, slew him, and seven _Spaniards_ more, besides twenty two
dangerously wounded; those which escap’d by flight, got to _Zubo_, where
being invited to Dinner by the King, they were all of them (in stead of
a second Course) Murther’d at Table. The occasion of this was out of
Revenge, because the _Spaniards_ had fall’n too foul upon their Women
and Maids, Devirginating, and forcing them to their Pleasure, than which
rudeness nothing was among them more Detestable. The Sea-men weakned by
these Misfortunes, were necessitated to burn their third Ship, call’d,
_St. Jago_; but Sailing to the _Molucco_ Islands with the other two,
they Freighted them both with Cloves; with which the Ship _Trinitas_
Sail’d to _New-Spain_ through the South-Sea, and the _Victoria_,
Commanded by _John Sebastian de Lano_ went the same way which the
_Portuguese_ us’d, and so to St. _Lucar de Barrameda_, near _Sivile_,
where he came to Anchor with his Ship and eighteen Men.


                                SECT. X.
                    Ferdinando Cortez _his Voyage_.

[Sidenote: _Sottus_ cruelty.]

Although several Expeditions of the _Spaniards_ to _America_ prov’d very
unsuccessful at the first, yet they still undertook them afresh, and
with renewing Courage: _Ferdinando Sottus_, though he Landed five
hundred Men in _Florida_, yet brought no Treasure from thence, onely he
cut off the Hands of fifteen Princes, because they would not discover
their Mines of Gold.

[Sidenote: Miserable end of _Narvaez_.]

Yet far worse success had _Pamphilus Narvaez_, who lost both his Fleet
and Men, saving onely ten out of six hundred, in the River _Palma_, and
they also afterwards dy’d there, or eat one another to satisfie their
raging Hunger.

[Sidenote: _Cortez_ his Voyage.]

[Sidenote: Remarkable delivery.]

But much better was the fortune of _Ferdinando Cortez_, Sailing from
_Spain_ to _America_, in the Year 1519. who having the Command given him
over ten stout Ships, and three Frigats with five hundred Foot, and an
additional Force of sixteen Horse, rais’d by the new _Spanish_
Inhabitants on Cuba; with which Forces Landing on the Island
_Cozumella_, he prohibited Humane Sacrifice to their Idols, and Erected
a Cross with the Image of the Virgin _Mary_, in one of their Temples,
and releas’d _Hieronimus Aquilaris_, after a seven years Slavery, having
suffer’d Shipwrack with _Valdivia_; at which time some that sav’d
themselves in the Boat, were by the Current in thirty days driven to
_Jucatan_, in which time seven dy’d of Hunger; the rest going ashore,
were no sooner Landed, but Sacrific’d by the Natives to their Gods or
_Zemes_. Among the six that remain’d, yet left alive, and to be offer’d
after the same manner the next day, was this _Aquilaris_, who with his
Companions, breaking Prison, in the following night fled to a
Neighboring Prince their Enemy, and one that maintain’d a continual War
against these _Cannibals_.

[Sidenote: Strange Battel.]

[Sidenote: _Potanchanum_, a City.]

[Sidenote: _Colvacan_ Books, of what fashion, as also their Temples.]

Here _Cortez_ sent Articles of Peace to _Taxmarus_ the King of the
Countrey, but he sleighting his proffer, came down upon him into the
Field with forty thousand Men, drawn from the City _Potanchanum_, which
contain’d above twenty thousand Houses, all built of Stone: And indeed
the _Spaniards_ had here seen their last day, had not _Cortez_ drawn by
a seeming advantage the Enemies under his Canon, and sent his small
Party of Horse to attend the motion of the Rear; when so soon as they
had fir’d their Canon, making great Execution, the Front routed, and the
Rear terrifi’d with the noise and smoke of the Guns, they also broke,
being at the same instant Charg’d with the Horse, which were so terrible
to them that never saw Horses, nor such Service on Horseback before,
that in a short time the whole Body of so great an Army was utterly
dissipated, and the triumphing Conquerors took possession of the empty
City _Potanchanum_, where Solacing, they staid a whole Moneth. Then from
hence they Sail’d to _Colvaca_, where, upon the request of the Natives,
they settled a Colony. Amongst the Presents which were there given to
the _Spaniards_, were some of their own Volumes, Books, whose Leaves
were made of the innermost Rind of a Tree, and a kind of Paste, made of
their Meal, glew’d together; the Characters stood at some distance one
after another, rang’d like our _Christ-Cross Row_, or _A_, _B_, _C_.

Here _Cortez_ was amaz’d to behold their stately Temples, the Floors
whereof were cover’d with Embroyder’d Tapestry, beset with Precious
Stones, to which great multitudes flock’d, being very zealous to perform
their Devotions.

When their Seed is put into the Ground, or come to its full growth, they
offer young Children to their _Zemez_, richly Cloth’d, having been
fatten’d some Weeks before: When they want Children they kill their
Slaves, and in default of them, they pacifie them with Dogs.

[Sidenote: Strange Sacrifices.]

The _Victims_ that go to be Sacrific’d, they Worship with all Adoration,
Bowing and Congying before them.

[Sidenote: Strange Idol-Worship.]

Their Zeal in this their Idol-Worship may appear from a strange Custom,
observ’d by them when they enter their Temple, _viz._ they either draw
Blood out of their Tongues, Lips, Ears, Breast, Knees, or Palm of their
Hands, which they throw into the Air, supposing thereby to be pardon’d
by their indulgent Gods.

[Sidenote: _Zempoal_, a City.]

In the City _Zempoal_, _Cortez_ found five Slaves, who being kept close
Prisoners, were to be Sacrific’d the next day; but he releasing them,
did upon the importunate request of the _Quines_, or Priests, and
promises of great ransoms, and their telling of him that the _Zemez_
would spoil all their Seed and Plants that year, if they did not go on
with these Offerings, restor’d the Prisoners again; who, though the
enjoyments of all happinesses in the other World were promis’d them by
their Priest, and great assurance given thereof; yet they were not
forward, but return’d, unwilling to suffer, though by so gainful a
Sacrifice.

[Sidenote: _Zemez_ wonderful Idols.]

At the _Zemez_ Feet hung abundance of Mens Bones bundled up together,
and under them were Written the Names of their Enemies, whose Flesh had
been either Sacrific’d or eaten.

[Sidenote: _Cortez_ his Exploits.]

Twelve Leagues beyond _Zempoal_, _Cortez_ built a new City near the
River _Grisalva_, and call’d it _Vera Crux_, which _Diego Velasques_
resented so ill, it being done without his knowledge, that he petition’d
the Council of _Cuba_ to give Sentence of Death against the Founder: But
whilst _Cortez_ expected an answer from the Embassadors (which were sent
to the _Spanish_ Court to give account of the necessity of building a
City there) he travell’d eighty Leagues Westerly. The _Zempoalensers_
accompanied him in great Troops, hoping by that means to shake off the
yoke of the mighty King _Montezuma_, against whom they were then
design’d. _Cortez_ coming into the Territory of _Sincuchimalar_, was in
the Name of _Montezuma_, by one of his Princes, courteously entertain’d
in a great Village, scituate on a steep Mountain, without any Path or
Way leading to it, but by two high Ladders. _Sincuchimalar_ lies
surrounded with Hills, whose tops seem to touch the Clouds. Coming down
from the Village, they travell’d through a barren and cold Valley, where
they suffer’d such great Inconveniences by want of Provisions and Water,
and exceeding coldness of the Weather, that many of them perish’d. After
that, they ascended a pleasant Hill, on whose summit stood a Chappel,
with a handsom Steeple, and hedg’d about with great heaps of Wood,
brought thither by the Inhabitants for the use of their Sacrifices. At
the foot of this Mountain was a fruitful Valley water’d by a pleasant
River, on whose Banks a certain Prince nam’d _Cacataminus_ had a Palace,
built of Stone, and containing many Rooms, and convenient Lodgings.
Somewhat higher to the Land, appear’d more of the like Structures, which
were all under _Montezuma_’s Jurisdiction; but the neighboring Countrey
_Tlaxcalla_, whose Inhabitants were famous for their Valor, would never
receive any Laws from _Montezuma_.

[Sidenote: Remarkable War in _Tlaxcalla_.]

_Cortez_ no sooner set footing in this Countrey, but he was set upon by
a thousand of the Inhabitants, who at the first Assault kill’d two of
the _Spanish_ Horse, yet after this bold Charge, the Assailants fled,
and on the next day desir’d Peace; whereupon the _Spaniards_ march’d
quietly into the Countrey, when a confus’d Company, or Forlorn-Hope,
making a horrible Noise, set upon them; but after a slight Skirmish,
they fled to their Main Body, which immediately drawing up, being at
least a hundred thousand, hemm’d in the handful of _Spaniards_, and so
were ready to swallow them, leaving them no Angle to escape at. Thus
invironed, they were assailed on every side, fighting till Sun-set, and
had undoubtedly been utterly destroy’d, had not _Cortez_ ply’d his six
Pieces of Cannon, discharging continually Volley after Volley upon them;
and though the Execution was very much, yet the Sound and report of
their Ordinance was more terrible to them that were out of the reach of
the Bullet, and made more to the gaining so great a Victory, Fear
conquering more than Slaughter; so that by the Evening, despairing
either of their Safety or better Fortune, the whole Army disbanding
fled: But the pursuing Conquerors firing five of their Villages,
remain’d Masters of the Field; yet they, though thus totally routed,
taking fresh Courage (a wonderful thing!) reinforc’d them, and set upon
the _Spanish_ Camp, with no less than 150000 Fighting Men: Yet
notwithstanding so vast an Army, _Cortez_ so well order’d his small
parcel of Men, and so valiantly led on upon all Advantages, that he in
like manner defeated this, as they thought, Invincible Preparation. Thus
flesh’d with so much Blood of the Natives, he raged every where, giving
no Quarter where-ever he went.

Mean while _Quesitangal_, a neighboring Prince, having also raised an
Army with which he design’d, being assisted by darkness, craftily to
fall into the _Spanish_ Quarters by Night, subtilly dissembling, sent
Embassadors the day before, with several Presents, and Overtures of
Peace, which indeed were onely Spies, to take notice where they might
best break in upon them; which _Cortez_ mistrusting, and soon being
inform’d of the whole Design, he cut off the Spies Hands, so sending
them back to _Quesitangal_ with Defiance: Hereupon the _Indians_
immediately setting forward, took advantage of the ensuing Night, and
with great fury fell upon the _Spaniards_, who preacquainted with the
Design, were in so good a posture to receive them, that not able to
endure such hot Service, they quickly retreated, and utterly gave over
the Enterprize: But _Cortez_ as much encourag’d by these Victories,
pursu’d them, and the same Night Storm’d _Tlaxcalla_, a City containing
above twenty thousand Houses, which in few Hours he carried. This City
was curiously built, of bak’d Stones, and a place of great Trade;
insomuch that the Market-places swarm’d with Buyers and Sellers,
bartering one with another all manner of Provisions, as Fish, Flesh, and
Bread, also Plumes of Feathers, Pearls, imbroyder’d Tapestry, Chalk,
Stones, Timber, and Herbs.

Twenty days _Cortez_ staid here to refresh his Army, and then march’d to
the neighboring City _Chiurutical_, with the Auxiliary Forces of the
_Tlaxcallans_, to the number of above a hundred thousand; they told him,
That the People of _Chiurutical_ had barricado’d up their Streets, laid
upon the tops of their Houses great heaps of Stones, that their upper
Rooms were cramm’d with Archers, and all things made ready both for
Offence and Defence; which Advertisement he not much hearkned to,
because he was conducted into the City with all their State-Formalities
of Singing and Tabering upon their _Tamboes_, and every where
courteously entertain’d.

[Sidenote: A Plot strangely discover’d.]

[Sidenote: Strange Martial Affairs.]

Mean while _Montezuma_ had rais’d a great Army, which were in their
advance, not onely to the defence of his Border, but to surprize them
while they staid in that City, the Townsmen having invited him thither
to their rescue and his own defence, had not the Plot been accidentally
discover’d by a _Chirutecan_ Woman, who giving advice to one of her
Friends that follow’d _Cortez_, that he should immediately make his
escape, because that all the Strangers would be destroy’d within few
Hours, who came and inform’d _Cortez_ thereof; whereupon he desir’d all
the Magistrates of the City to come and speak with him, who no sooner
entred the Hall where he was, but his Men by Command immediately shot
them to death, which terrible Rumor spreading, and alarm’d with the
report of the Executing Musquets, the City was suddenly in an Uproar,
gathering thither Arm’d from all Places, and began a sharp Conflict,
which lasted five Hours; but then wearied out, and despairing of
Success, loosing their Courage, they desir’d a Cessation, and at last
concluded Peace with the _Spaniards_.

[Sidenote: Now _Mexico_.]

This News of his discover’d Intention, so startled _Montezuma_, that he
suppos’d it better to desist, and procure the Favor of _Cortez_ by
Presents; wherefore he sent him 15000 Cotton Habits, trim’d up very
richly, ten great Chargers of Gold, and some Vessels of Wine, desiring
him for a while to forbear his Intentions of marching to _Tenustitan_
his Chief City, and that he would in the mean while treat with him for
an Accommodation. But _Cortez_, though he accepted of the Presents, yet
nevertheless held his Resolution of marching on.

[Sidenote: Wonderful Mountain _Popocatepeque_.]

[Sidenote: Resolution of two _Spaniards_.]

Eight Leagues from _Tenustitan_ he saw the double-spired Mountain
_Popocatepeque_, so call’d from the Smoke which continually ascends from
its top; for _Popoca_ signifies _A Smoke_, and _Tepeque, A Mountain_.
The Smoke rises upright, and with so much strength, that by the greatest
Wind it deviates not one jot from mounting upwards in a direct Line, to
whose forked Head ten _Spaniards_ resolv’d to climb; but having got
scarce half way up, they were forc’d to return, the Ashes lying
knee-deep; yet at last two more resolute conquer’d all those
Difficulties, and got to the top, where the mouth of the Cave, as they
guessed, measur’d four Miles in Circumference: The shaking of the
Mountain, and roaring of the Flames, frequently bursting forth, so much
terrified them, that they staid not long there; for, as we said, the
Ground not onely trembled under them, but the Fiery Gulph ejected great
Stones, which falling down on all sides of the Mountain, rolled to the
bottom; and without doubt they had there perish’d, had they not speedily
run to a hollow neighboring Hill, from whence they came at length to the
rest of their Company, where they were admir’d by the _Indians_ for
their undaunted Resolution, and presented with several rich Gifts. These
_Indians_ had a Tradition, That for wicked Princes, and such as had not
govern’d the People well, this was the _Tophet_ appointed for their
Torments.

[Sidenote: Strange Cities in _America_.]

[Sidenote: A very strange Cawse-way.]

_Cortez_ being got through the poor Territory of the _Guazazingers_, and
having suffer’d great Cold upon the Mountains, discover’d _Amaquameca_,
the chief City of the Province _Chialco_, seated in a great Lake, to
which he row’d in a kind of Boats, by the Inhabitants call’d _Acales_.
Passing from thence, he was courteously receiv’d in _Iztapalapa_,
another City, which boasts above eight thousand Stone Buildings, besides
admirable Palaces, with spacious Rooms, delightful Gardens, and Ponds
full of Fish, and almost cover’d with Fowl; from whence a Wall or
Cawse-way of a great breadth, that cross’d over both Land and Water, led
from _Iztapalapa_ to _Tenustitan_. This Cawse-way hath many Bridges,
which are drawn up in time of War, under which the Water runs out of a
Salt Lake into a Fresh, that ebbs and flows, although lying between high
Mountains, and seventy Leagues from the Sea.

On both sides this Wall, being ten Leagues in length, appears three
great Towns, _viz._ _Mesiqualisingo_, _Colvacana_, and _Vuichilabusco_,
all Populous, and well-built.

[Sidenote: How they make Salt.]

_Colvacana_ is supplied by the Salt Lake, to its no small benefit and
inriching; for the Water being by Pipes convey’d into the City, in all
the Places and Cisterns for its reception makes a Scum, which being
coagulated by the Sun, and after boyl’d, becomes Salt, with which they
drive a great Trade; for no Salt being to be had in any place but here,
all Foreign Merchants come thither for Supply.

[Sidenote: Remarkable Passage of King _Montezuma_.]

_Cortez_ being in his March within a League and a half of _Tenustitan_,
_Montezuma_, preceded with a thousand of his Nobless, came to meet and
salute him, all of them rather like Pilgrims, bare-footed, and congying,
kissing their right Hands, with which they first kiss’d the Ground:
After them appear’d _Montezuma_ himself, who put a Chain of Gold,
imboss’d with Pearls, about _Cortez_ his Neck, and immediately conducted
him to the City, where having entred, and being come into the Palace,
_Montezuma_ plac’d _Cortez_ on a Golden Throne, and surrendred up his
Right to his Catholick Majesty of _Spain_, in the presence of all his
Peers, to their no small amazement.

But whilst all things had a good face, and went on thus fairly beyond
their expectations, _Cortez_ was inform’d, That King _Coalcopoca_ had a
Design on the new City _Vera Crux_, and had treacherously murder’d two
of the Garrison, and wounded two more: Whereupon _Cortez_ having such
fair beginnings, who had swallow’d already in his Hopes the whole Empire
and Wealth belonging to _Montezuma_, laid hold of this Occasion,
pretending Treason, and breach of Contract; wherefore he put _Montezuma_
under Custody, notwithstanding he had clear’d himself of the Conspiracy,
by bringing _Coalcopoca_, with his Sons, and fifteen of his Peers,
Prisoners to _Tenustitan_, who by the command of _Cortez_ suffer’d a
lingering death, being all burnt with Green Wood. But in vain did
_Montezuma_ think to reconcile himself with _Cortez_, since all he did
could render no manner of satisfaction; however he continu’d to oblige
him by fresh Favors, whose Relation we will be more particular in, as
meriting the same.

[Sidenote: Description of the Royal City _Tenustitan_.]

[Sidenote: _Cacaos_, what manner of Fruit.]

[Sidenote: Stately Temple.]

[Sidenote: Horrible Images.]

_Montezuma_’s Grandees seem’d to be much discontented, because he had
without the least resistance or consideration setled a handful of
Strangers to domineer over his whole Dominions, by which his weakness
and pusillanimity, he was now a Prisoner, like a common Malefactor, who
had formerly govern’d so mighty Territories. Amongst several Princes
which seem’d thus to be concern’d, was _Catumazin_ Governor of the
Province _Hacolvacan_ who had he not been surpriz’d and attaqu’d the
Night before by the information and discovery of _Montezuma_ himself, he
would have hazarded the ruine of all _Cortez_ his Successes: But now
Fortune still daily more smil’d, giving wonderful Advantages to the
_Spaniards_; Silver and Gold continually flowing like Rivers from all
Quarters, that their onely trouble and puzzle was where and how to
dispose it: but yet for all this, they were not free from jealousie,
that _Montezuma_’s Forces might swallow theirs, though he was secur’d;
of which you may judge by the vastness of his Imperial City
_Tenustitan_, seated in the Province of _Mexico_, where a Salt Lake
mixes its Waters with a fresh River, both which in circumference
contain, as we said, seventy Leagues, and distant from the Main Land
five or six Miles; the Water about it continually cover’d with small
Boats rowing up and down. It hath four Stone, besides DrawBridges in
several Places, and strengthned with Gates no less artificial than
costly, which lead from the City to the Main Land. The Fresh Water is
convey’d through the Salt in a Wall’d Channel, out of which none may
take up Water, except they pay Excise to the Kings Farmers. This City
boasts above sixty thousand Houses, all divided into Islands, but joyn’d
with great Wooden Bridges: The Market-place surrounded with Galleries,
drives a quick and constant Trade, being always full of Buyers and
Sellers. In every Street they have a publick Inn, in each of which they
keep Ordinaries, wherein the Tables are stor’d with well-dress’d Flesh
and Fish, not wanting plenty of Wine. Their Trades are divided into
several Companies, and they have their peculiar Places to dwell in. They
deal very much in _Cacaos_, a Fruit not unlike an Almond, which beaten
to Powder, and prepar’d with several other Ingredients, gives name to
that excellent Drink now in use with us, call’d _Chocolate_: They grow
onely on moist and warm Grounds, and are us’d so currently in Trade,
that they go in stead of Money. Amongst many beautiful Edifices, their
Guild is very magnificent, wherein twelve Judges, attended by a
considerable number of Officers and Servants, sit daily, hearing and
determining all manner of Causes. The next is their Chief Temple or
Minster, built quadrangular, all of Free-Stone, having four Portals,
opening into the four principal Streets or Triumphs, that end at the
four Stone Bridges. On the Walls, being of an exceeding height, stand
several Turrets, so high, that they seem to hide their Spires in the
Clouds; and have Apartments, wherein the Priests Diet, Lodge, and Study,
which are ascended by Marble Steps. These Religious Persons are
generally of Noble Extract, which at seven years old are carried
thither, where leading a very strict Life, they never come forth to see
the World, till they enter the State of Matrimony. The famous
_Colossus_, that stood over the _Rhodian_ Haven, between whose Legs all
Ships did Sail, that came in or went out of the Harbor, cannot stand in
competition with the stupendious Idol _Vuichilabuchichi_, whose Head
touches the Arch’d Ceiling of the high Temple. Near his stand several
lesser Images, made of Meal and all sorts of Herbs bak’d together, and
kneaded with Mens Blood. Along the Walls are exceeding dark Vaults, in
which the Priests onely walk; over them are large Halls, full of
Presentations of their Gods, which serve for the Burying-places of their
Kings.

Whilst _Cortez_ and _Montezuma_ were viewing the Temple, two _Spaniards_
rush’d suddenly into one of the Cells, where they found abundance of
Lamps and Torches burning, and the Walls bedaub’d two Inches thick with
Humane Gore: Over-head hung vast numbers of their Sacrificing Knives;
and the stench of the place was intollerable.

[Sidenote: Grandeur of the Kings in _Tenustitan_.]

[Sidenote: Strange Garden-houses.]

But _Cortez_ going on, _Montezuma_ and his Attendants resented it very
hainously, that he pull’d down some of their Idols, and durst presume to
look in the Kings Face; for those People bear so great Reverence to
their Kings, that none dares so much as once look up in their presence:
His Council stand bare-footed, stooping with their Faces bow’d almost to
the Ground before him: Four times a day they change their Apparel; and a
Suit which they have once worn, is put to no other use, but presented to
such Soldiers as have done some eminent Service. Whatever manner of
Chargers, Dishes, Pots, Cups, and other Vessels the Emperor is serv’d in
at his Table, are every Meal new. The King hath in _Tenustitan_ three
great Structures, whose Magnificence, for Cost and rare Architecture,
can hardly be parallell’d. The first is the Residence for all deform’d
People: The second, an _Aviary_ for all manner of Birds and Fowl, being
a spacious open place, Roof’d with Nets, and surrounded with Marble
Galleries. The third, being a Den for Wild Beasts, was divided into
several Rooms, wherein were kept Lions, Tygers, Wolves, Foxes, and all
manner of Four-footed Animals.

[Sidenote: _Spaniards_ beaten afresh.]

[Sidenote: Remarkable Exploits of _Cortez_.]

[Sidenote: _Tenustitan_, or _Mexico_, taken.]

But whilst _Cortez_ having staid waiting eight Months in _Tenustitan_,
for the return of the Messengers sent to the _Spanish_ Court, receiv’d
Tidings, That _Pamphilo Narvaecy_, by order of _Velasques_, was come
with eighteen Sail, Mann’d with eight hundred Foot, and eighty Horse,
from _Cuba_, and now riding before the _Mexican_ Coast; from whence soon
after he receiv’d unexpected Command, to come presently aboard unarm’d,
and resign up his Authority: But he in stead of submission, compell’d
_Narvaecy_ in a short time to relinquish his Title, and own him for
Superior. Mean while the _Spaniards_ which remain’d in possession of
_Tenustitan_, ran the hazard of a general Massacre; for the Citizens
much stomacking the Oppressions of the _Spaniards_, who grew very
insolent, inslaving their King, bringing their inveterate Enemies the
_Tlaxcallans_ and _Guazuzingans_ into their City, exacting them to pay
Tributes, pulling down their Gods, and demolishing their ancient Idols,
they brake out from all Parts in a tumultuous manner, ran to Arms, and
besieg’d them Day and Night in their Fort, although _Montezuma_
endeavor’d to perswade the contrary. _Cortez_, hearing of it, came to
their relief with the New Forces Landed from _Cuba_; but he fighting his
way ere he could get in, was so roughly entertain’d by the _Mexicans_,
that they kill’d him forty Men, wounding as many more; and
notwithstanding fifteen Field-pieces with continual Shot made foul
Breaches, lessening the number of the Assailants, yet they suddenly
fill’d up their Vacancies again with fresh Men, which clamber’d over the
Heaps of those that lay slain. Three Days the Battel had continu’d very
fierce, when _Montezuma_ being with the _Spaniards_ in the Castle, went
to a low Window, to see if he could command his Subjects to retreat; but
a continual Cry so deafned their Ears, and showres of Arrows and Stones
so took away their sight, that he did nothing: Then _Montezuma_,
thinking to be more easily either heard or seen, went to a higher
Window, where looking out, he was unfortunately hit with a Stone, of
which he died three days after. Besides their Enemies, the _Spaniards_
suffer’d extremely by Famine; and though they had beaten down a Tower,
which had done the Castle great mischief, and set five hundred Houses on
fire, yet they could discern no likely issue thereof, but judg’d it best
to make their escape by Night over the nearest Bridge: _Cortez_
therefore dividing his gotten Treasures, which amounted to above seven
hundred thousand Duckets, amongst his Soldiers, carried _Montezuma_’s
Son, and two Daughters, Prisoners with him, though not without infinite
danger and loss; for the _Tenustitans_ assail’d him on both sides, and
falling in also upon his Rear, spar’d not to kill _Montezuma_’s own
Children. In this last Fight the Service was so hot, that _Cortez_ lost
forty two Horse, a hundred and fifty _Spaniards_, and two thousand
Auxiliaries; and although gotten over the Lake, they were still pursu’d
by the _Mexicans_, who would then undoubtedly have made a general
Slaughter, had not _Cortez_ amused the Enemies, by leaving in the Night
great Fires in several Places, his suppos’d Camps, whilst he silently
stole away: Yet the _Tenustitans_ would have pursu’d the _Spaniards_,
had they not wanted Provisions: But _Cortez_ sending his Treasure before
him, through the Countrey _Colva_, to _Vera Crux_, with a Convoy of five
Horse, and forty four Foot, were all cut off by the _Colvaans_, and
feasted upon in a Thanksgiving Sacrifice. The same misfortune befel
twelve _Spaniards_ in _Tepeacu_, which great City surrendred it self up
to _Cortez_, being assisted by a mighty Army of _Tlaxcallans_ and
others. But after all these Losses, he took _Guaccachiulla_, and
_Izzuca_, both fortified with strong Walls and Gates; in which last he
burnt above a hundred Temples, built for Humane Sacrifices. All the
Countrey through which he thus ransack’d, he call’d _New-Spain_. From
the City _Tazuco_, which he had newly taken, intending to besiege
_Tenustitan_, he digg’d through the Lakes a broad Trench, of above three
Leagues in length, to bring up thirteen new Ships to _Tenustitan_; and
the neighboring People envying, that that City should not be conquer’d,
as well as theirs, rais’d an Army of above a hundred and fifty thousand
Men, making _Cortez_ their General: Himself incamped on one corner of
the City, appointing the other two sides to be invested by _Gonsales
Sandovalo_, and _Pedro Avarado_; but the Besieg’d resolutely broke out,
and made a fierce Sally with five thousand Boats, setting upon the
thirteen Ships; but the great Guns made such execution and havock
amongst them, that they retreated with great damage. Whoever were taken
Prisoners in this Fight by the _Spaniards_, the _Tlaxcallans_, being
Commission’d by _Cortez_, feasted upon. On the seventh day the City was
taken, but not without great Slaughter, and the new King imprison’d.

[Sidenote: Sad accident occasion’d by a _Tyger_.]

After this mighty Conquest, _Cortez_ resolv’d to discover those
Territories that lay Southward; and whilst he was making all things
ready for the Voyage, he sent two Ships with an invaluable Treasure to
_Spain_, who fearing to be taken by the _French_ Pyrats, ran in at
_Tercera_, where a miserable Accident hapned to the Seamen of the
biggest Ship, wherein were carried two Tygers, which though taken young,
and bred up amongst men, yet had not so quite forgotten their natural
ferocity, but that one breaking loose in the Night, tore seven of them
in pieces, hurting a far greater number, of which some had the Brawns of
their Arms, the Calves of their Legs, and fleshy parts of their Thighs
bit out.

[Sidenote: Strange Battel with Baboons.]

Several Places in _America_ breed Tygers, that far exceed Lyons in
fierceness; so that where any considerable number of them frequents,
though the Soil be never so fruitful, yet it is left desolate and
forsaken. But the Baboons that frequent the Woods are more pleasant, and
less dangerous. _Peter Arias_ relates, That his whole Army incountred
with these Beasts, which climb’d from one Tree to the other, shrieking,
and making very strange Gesticulations to those that were gone before,
and gathering their Mouths and Hands full of Stones, which they threw as
exact and strongly as a Man. When one of these Baboons, shot by a
Musquet, fell to the Ground, the rest gave such a horrible shriek, that
the Woods resounding with the noise, strook a terror into the
_Spaniards_. Amongst several things that hapned in this Counter-scuffle,
take this one: A _Spaniard_ taking aim with his Musquet at an old
Baboon, which sate pearch’d up in a Tree, and being now just ready to
give Fire, the Baboon Soldier, at the very instant, to break the Shot,
taking a Stone out of his Mouth, threw it exactly into the Mans Mouth,
with such force as beat out some of his Teeth; with which sudden blow
surpris’d, he lost his Mark; and the proud Foe, shewing signs of
Triumph, went his way.

[Sidenote: Great destruction.]

[Sidenote: The unfortunate Expedition of _Garajus_.]

[Sidenote: _Spaniards_ rosted.]

[Sidenote: _Cortez_ his Ambition.]

But whilst _Cortez_ staid in the Countrey of _Tenustitan_ (now call’d
_Mexico_) _Franciscus Garajus_ sail’d out of the Haven of _Jamaica_,
with eleven Ships, to the River _Panucus_, there, according to the
Command of the Emperor _Charles_, to plant a Colony: Whereupon he went
ashore, ordering his Fleet to sail along in sight of Land: So wading
through the River _Montaltus_, which glides between high Mountains, he
came to a Morassy Ground, in which he and they often sunk almost up to
the Middle, and lost his way in a Thicket of young Trees; yet at last
being come to the River _Panucus_, he found several high Walls, being
the Ruines of Fortresses, Temples, and Towers, destroy’d by _Cortez_; so
that the City lay quite desolate. Twenty Leagues further, upon the Banks
of the same River, _Cortez_ had in like manner sack’d and destroy’d
_Chiglia_, a Town which before its burning reckon’d above twenty
thousand Houses, besides many fair Palaces, Walls, Towers, and Temples:
Which Cruelties and Spoil had bred so great an _Odium_ in the
Inhabitants against the _Spaniards_, that they immediately sent an Army
against _Garajus_, who had only a few half-starv’d Men with him; yet he
receiv’d the Enemy twice in his Retreat to the new Colony _St. Steven_,
rais’d out of _Chiglia_’s Ruines; but finding no Provisions where-ever
he came, he judg’d it fittest to send his Horse into the Countrey to
Forage; which _Cortez_ meeting, took Prisoners, under pretence that
_Garajus_ came to take Possession, where he had neither Authority nor
Right. _Cortez_ also made himself Master of _Garajus_ Ship and Fleet,
commanding him withal to appear in _Tenustitan_, which not knowing how
to avoid, he obey’d: His People mean time ranging up and down without a
Head or Commander, either died by Famine, or were murther’d and eaten by
the Natives; for at one time the _Americans_ made a general Feast with
two hundred and fifty rosted _Spaniards_: But their days of Triumph
lasted not long; for _Sandovalus_, one of _Cortez_ his Prime Officers,
set with so much fury upon those _Cannibals_, that he kill’d several
thousands of them, and burnt sixty Persons of Prime Quality, all
Commanders, in the sight of their Friends and Relations. But _Garajus_,
whose Son was married to _Cortez_ his Daughter, liv’d not long after the
Wedding, which occasion’d a murmur as if _Cortez_ had poyson’d him, to
rid himself of a Partner in his Government; for it had been generally
observ’d, that his Ambition suffer’d no Equal. The _Americans_ fell all
down before him; all were Servants alike: The Court which he kept
swarm’d with Attendance, on which he spent vast Sums of Money; yet his
Incomes were able to bear such excessive Disbursements. He kept in
constant Pay five thousand Soldiers, and several Ships ready rigg’d and
prepar’d on all occasions, to hold in awe the enslav’d People, or else
for the Discovery of New Countreys: Yet after all these extraordinary
Charges defray’d, to shew his Wealth and Greatness, he caus’d a Piece of
Cannon to be cast all of massie Gold: for the Kings which formerly
acknowledg’d _Montezuma_ for their Sovereign, gave him a yearly Revenue,
most of which were valu’d to be worth twenty three Tun of Gold; for so
much the King of _Tescuscus_, a stately City, paid, whose Houses
Plaister’d with White-Lime, seem’d afar off to be rather a Chalky Hill
or Mountain, cover’d with Snow: Full as much did the King pay which
reigned in _Otumba_, notwithstanding he had receiv’d with his
_Christianity_ the Name of _Ferdinand Cortez_; yet others gave less: The
King _Guacinalgo_, with his Mother, and some Slaves, bringing Gold, came
to present it to _Cortez_; and entring the Palace, through a Guard of
five hundred Horse and four Hundred Foot, which were always ready Arm’d
for fear of Insurrections, he fell down prostrate on the Ground. Thus
all things even out-went whatever he could desire, hope for, or imagine.
And _Alvaredo_, one of his Commanders, being sent Eastwardly, brought
great Treasures back with him, which the conquer’d Kings were forc’d to
raise.

[Sidenote: His Misfortunes.]

But Fortune, who seldom continues her Favors long, at last began to
frown; for _Cortez_ having sent an unvaluable Treasure of Gold and
Pearls to the Emperor _Charles_ the Fifth, _Floryn_ the _French_ Pyrate
met with and took it, which went so much to his Heart, that for a
considerable time he sent no Advice to the _Spanish_ Court, which made
them grow jealous of him, doubting that he intended to make himself King
over _New-Spain_; and this Suspicion was not a little augmented by his
Enemies.

[Sidenote: A Plot of two _Spanish_ Officers.]

In the Neck of these, follow’d another Misfortune; for _Christopher
Olitus_, sent out by _Cortez_ to discover new Countreys, rebelling, took
up Arms against him, being then in the Haven _Figueras_, five hundred
Leagues beyond. Notwithstanding the _Spaniards_, although amongst a
new-conquer’d People, which without doubt long’d for Revenge, were not
to take notice of their danger, but to go on with undaunted Resolution;
whereupon _Cortez_ drawing out a strong Party, march’d a long and
troublesom way to meet _Olitus_, making great Slaughters where-ever he
came. _Francisco de las Casas_ was commanded to go upon the same Account
by Sea, and arriving first, found him setling his new Colony, which he
nam’d _Triumph de Sancta Crux_; and notwithstanding the Water with a
Northerly Wind was very rough and boysterous in the Haven _Figueras_
(which the _Spaniards_ call’d so, because they found Trees there, which
growing at the Foot of the Mountains, bore a Fruit not unlike a Fig) yet
they came to a present Engagement, wherein _Casas_ worsting _Olitus_,
having sunk one of his Ships, stood out again to Sea; but surpriz’d by a
violent Storm, and driven on the Shore, fell into _Olitus_’s Hands, who
had a little before also taken _Egidíus_ or _Giles Gonsales_. These two
Prisoners consulted together how they might poyson or murder _Olitus_,
which fell out according to their desires, because the Servants of the
House where they lodg’d sided with them; so taking hold of the first
opportunity, as they were at Supper together, they stabb’d him with
their Knives in several places; yet the Wounds were not so great or
mortal, but that he retain’d strength to escape in the dark to a
neighboring Hut; but the Assassinates immediately sent out Messengers,
publishing, That he who did not, knowing where _Olitus_ was immediately
bring him to them, should receive condign punishment; which terrifying
_Olitus_, he discover’d himself, and was immediately beheaded.

[Sidenote: _Mexicans_ Apparel.]

During the time that the _Spanish_ Officers had these Civil Broyls one
against another, _Lodowick Pontæus_, a Man well experienc’d in the Law,
came from _Spain_ to _America_, there in the Emperors Name to settle all
things in good order; having also particular Instructions, to shew great
kindness to _Cortez_, and to make him a Knight of the Order of _St.
James_, that by that means the Emperor might be the more esteem’d for
his Noble Subjects and Servants, amongst the _Mexicans_, who are
themselves of a proud and ambitious spirit, and chiefly the Nobility,
which doth manifestly appear by their Apparel, more gorgeous than the
meaner sort of _Americans_; and though the Slaves go stark naked (having
onely a Cloth tied about their Privities) and with a Bowe and Arrows
walk before their Lords, yet the Better Sort go very costly Habited; for
about their Necks they wear Strings of Pearl; on their Heads, a Cap,
from whence hang down two Scarfs, one longer than the other; then a
party-colour’d Cotton Coat covers their whole Bodies to their Knees,
under which they wear a Vest girt about their Middle.

But at last, after all these Services, _Cortez_ disagreeing with the
Vice-Roy _Don Antonio Mendoza_, being about that time sent over, went
male-contented into _Spain_.


                               SECT. XI.
                   Diego Gottierez _his Expedition_.

[Sidenote: _Gottierez_ contests with _Contreras_.]

[Sidenote: Is forsaken of all.]

[Sidenote: Great Tempest.]

[Sidenote: Village _Francisco_.]

[Sidenote: Strange manner of eating.]

[Sidenote: Unsatisfied Covetousness of _Gottierez_.]

_Anno 1540._ _Gottierez_ being chosen Governor of _New Carthage_,
weigh’d Anchor from _Cadiz_, and sailing to _Nombre de Dios_, upon his
Landing clash’d with _Roderick Contreras_, in whose Place he was sent to
succeed. Two Years he spent without effecting any thing; but at last
coming to Agreement with _Contreras_, he took the Governorship upon him,
having first forewarn’d him not to depend too much upon his Authority;
for the Countrey being full of Woods and Mountains, might hide many of
his Enemies: But he not regarding the Advice, went a Journey from _New
Granada_, and having march’d fifty Leagues Easterly, he cross’d into the
River _Suere_, with sixty _Spaniards_, and was presented by the Princes
of the Countrey with as much Gold as amounted to seven thousand Duckets.
Here he spent some Weeks, effecting little; but now all things growing
scarce, though he was very earnest with the Natives for Provisions, yet
he could get little; which kind of Life the Soldiers disliking, and
growing weary of, went away in the Night to _Nicaragua_. _Gottierez_
thus left alone, got into a Boat, with intent to follow them; and being
just put off from the Shore, was met by Captain _Barjanto_, who brought
new Forces and fresh Provisions with him: This wrought upon him to stay
there. Not long after _Alphonso de Pisa_ went with twenty seven Men from
_Nombre de Dios_ to the same River _Suere_; but it being then very rough
at the Entrance, he was necessitated to pass on to a small uninhabited
Isle, where whilst he lay at an Anchor, the Weather began to grow worse
and worse; the Gusts of Wind, mix’d with Showres of Rain, Thunder, and
Lightning, seem’d to threaten a general Destruction; for in the Ship two
_Spaniards_ and one _Moor_ were kill’d by the Lightning: In seventy two
Days, the Sun did not shine four Hours: At last weighing Anchor, he
sail’d over to the Main Land, where he saw nothing but vast Mountains
and Wildernesses. Here for a time they liv’d upon Cockles found on the
Shore, and wild Fruits in the Woods: At length coming to _Gottierez_, he
sent him with his People in five Boats to fetch new Forces from _Nombre
de Dios_. In his way thither he saw a House built of Canes, cover’d with
Palm-leaves, forty five Paces long, and built after an Oval fashion:
Round about it stood several lesser Hovels, all which making up a
Village, the _Spaniards_ nam’d _Francisco_, because they came thither on
_St. Francis_ Day. About half way they met with the Lords of _Suere_ and
_Chiuppa_, going to attend _Gottierez_, to whom being admitted, and
sitting with him at Table, he gave them, as a Dainty, rosted Chickens
and fresh Pork; but they gave it to their Servants, not delighting in
the taste of such Victuals. _Gottierez_, by means of an Interpreter,
told them concerning the _Christian Religion_, at which they bow’d their
Heads, without making any Answer: But how little mind they had to
embrace it, quickly appear’d; for not long after, they set their
Villages on fire, and all the Provisions which they could not carry with
them, they spoil’d, and so retiring, hid themselves upon inaccessible
Mountains. Another Incentive leading them to this Fight, was, because
the Governor _Camachiren_, and his Deputy (notwithstanding he had given
_Gottierez_ as much Gold, when he came first into the Countrey, as
amounted to seven thousand Duckets, as we mention’d before) yet was put
in Prison by his Order, contrary to all Promises: Nay, _Gottierez_
threatned to burn him not regarding, that he had besides receiv’d of him
several Pieces of Gold, resembling all manner of Beasts, as Tygers, and
others; and also Fishes and Fowls curiously wrought, which were valu’d
at two Tun of Gold; yet this Present seemed too little for him,
whereupon bringing the Prisoner to a Chest, he swore that he would rost
him by degrees, if in four days time he did not furnish him with four
times as much more Gold as that Chest would hold: Whereupon
_Chamachiren_’s Servants went away to get the requir’d Gold; but he,
through carelesness of the Watch, made his escape in the Night, so that
_Gottierez_ lost his Booty. But the other Prisoners, though threatned to
be torn asunder with Dogs, remain’d firm, disowning that they had any
Gold; and among the rest, one speaking boldly to the _Spanish_ Officer
said, _That he stood amaz’d at his treacherous dealings, why did he keep
him Chain’d against Law and Promise, and often threaten’d him with
death, but yet would not kill him, for he, said he, had rather choose to
die, than live so miserable a life_.

_Gottierez_’s Conscience troubling him, he would willingly have releas’d
the _Indian_, and the rather, because he promis’d to procure a great
ransome of Gold; but the inferior Commanders would not consent to it.
After this they march’d six days through great Wildernesses, and over
high Mountains, finding no Footsteps of any People. Lastly, They came
down a very dangerous and steep Mountain, where had not the Shrubs and
jutting Stones serv’d them to hold by, they had all broken their Necks.

[Sidenote: Dangerous Mountains.]

[Sidenote: Strange Huts.]

Fifteen Leagues, the hanging of this Mountain spread it self along a
sweet River, on whose opposite Shore stood strange Huts full of dead
Tygers, Deers Heads, and Legs; here they staid two days to rest
themselves, where the Trees _Mamei_ and the _Cazabi_ Plants yielded them
good Food.

[Sidenote: Valiant fight.]

Travelling forward, _Gottierez_ ask’d an _Indian_ which was the nearest
way to a Village, but he pretending not to know any near hand, had his
Head immediately cut off. In like manner, and for the same reason the
_Indian_ Prince should also have been Executed, had not _Gottierez_
given order to the contrary; seeing his resolution, that with no less
Patience than undaunted Courage, stretch’d forth his Neck to the
Executioners. Mean while, their Provisions decreasing, they suffer’d
extreme hunger; insomuch, that some fainted quite away. The Souldiers
also rebelling against _Gottierez_ for Food, he commanded them to kill
their Dogs, and stamp the Barks of Trees; two days they travelled much
discontented in this manner, and at last came to the entrance of a Wood,
where they espy’d an _Indian_ standing behind a Tree, which on a sudden
ran away with incredible swiftness: early the next morning, above four
thousand _Indians_ came Marching against the faint _Spaniards_, making a
terrible noise with Horns and Drums; they were all except their Princes
Painted black and red; some wore Plumes of Feathers on their Heads, and
Collars of the same about their Necks; the fight began very fiercely, by
casting abundance of Stones, and shooting of Arrows, wherein, though
_Gottierez_ was at first Wounded, yet after half an hour the Assailants
fled, but recruited with fresh Forces renew’d the fight, breaking into
their Ranks, and making so great slaughter amongst them with Woodden
Swords, and Palm-Tree Clubs, knocking down, and dealing such deadly
Wounds, that of the _Spaniards_, three onely escap’d, saving themselves
by flight, who two hours after, much amaz’d and terrify’d, came to their
reserve, consisting onely of twenty four Men, which _Alphonso de Risa_
Commanded; the insulting Enemy at their Heels, waving over their Heads
the Swords, Shields, and Cross-Bows which they had gotten from the slain
_Spaniards_; and some withal crying in the _Spanish_ Tongue, _Come
Christians, come, and take Gold_. But _de Risa_, for all their pride,
set them going with some Volleys of Shot; after this, escaping
innumerable other dangers, he came to _Nombre de Dios_, without having
effected any thing of Note.


                               SECT. XIA.
 _The Expeditions of_ Peter Alvarado, Francisco _and_ Gonzalvo Pizarro,
                        _and_ Diego de Almagro.

[Sidenote: _Pizarro_’s and _Almagro_’s remarkable exploits.]

In the City of _Panama_, in _New Spain_, liv’d three eminent
_Spaniards_, call’d _Francisco Pizarro_, _Diego de Almagro_, and
_Ferdinand de Luque_ a Priest, which joyntly design’d to discover
farther Southerly along the rich Gold and Pearl Coast, and inspect the
Southern Ocean. _De Luque_ was to look to home-affairs, and _Pizarro_
set Sail first with a Ship Man’d with one hundred and fourteen Men,
which _Almagro_ follow’d with seventy more, yet both were valiantly
repuls’d by the _Peruvians_; but although they return’d the first time
with bad success, yet they undertook their business once more, but with
no better fortune; whereupon discouraged, the undertaking seem’d to be
totally laid aside, and the _American_ Vice-Roy, _Peter de Rios_ forbad
any to attempt a farther Discovery concerning _Peru_.

The former difficulties with this Edict easily wrought upon _Pizarro_’s
men, all but twelve, to leave him, for the rest went over with the Ship
fitted out by _Rios_ with succors to the Island _Gallo_, where _Pizarro_
resided, having also fail’d in his second Expedition. But although he
had made two bad Voyages, yet having an inclination to a third attempt,
he went to _Spain_, desiring of the Emperor to be Governor of _Peru_,
which he had discover’d; for besides his Plea of Merits he had taken
possession of the Country twice by Landing there, intended for the use
of his Imperial Majesty; one of his Sea-men to that purpose flourishing
his two-handed Sword over his Head, the glittering of which Sword so
frighted the Natives, that none of them durst come near him.

[Sidenote: _Pizarro_’s fight on _Puna_.]

His request being consulted upon, was at last granted, the Government of
_Peru_ being conferred upon him; but _Almagro_ took it very ill, that
_Pizarro_ went to the Emperor on such a design for himself; yet by the
mediation of his Friends the difference was reconciled, then _Pizarro_
setting Sail with one hundred and fifty Foot besides Horse, and Landing
at the Island _Puna_, at first was courteously entertain’d; but the
_Spaniards_ by extravagant hunting and searching every where their
Houses for Gold, and committing several other outrages, incensing,
chang’d the humor of the Inhabitants so much, that they fell upon them.
In stead of Ensigns, Standards, and Warlike Trophies, they used long
Canes, at the end whereof were ty’d the Bones of their antient Hero’s,
honor’d by them after their death: But these Reliques sav’d not the
_Indians_ from slaughter, so well as the coverts of a neighboring Wood.

[Sidenote: Comes to _Peru_.]

[Sidenote: _Peruvian_ Temple.]

From this Isle, lying three degrees Southward of the _Equinoctial_,
_Pizarro_ passed over to the _Main Continent_, where they were all in a
great confusion, upon the report of the _Spaniards_ cruelties committed
in _Puna_; yet all the preparations of the _Indians_ to withstand,
stop’d not _Pizarro_ from his intended course; for first, having the
success to master _Tampez_, thence he made nothing to march his Forces
over the River _Ambato_, there burning a Temple Dedicated to the Sun.
The _Portico_ stood towards the East, the rising of their God, before
which hung a Curtain of their fine Cotton Stuff, within stood the
presentations of two Golden Rams, shaded with Black, and as many
Dragons, before which the Fire never went out, continually supply’d with
Offerings of burnt Incense; on the Pillars hung several Men flead, their
Flesh kept firm, and free from all Putrifaction, with the infusion of a
sharp Juyce.

Here _Almagro_ coming to _Pizarro_ with fresh Forces, they made no
little penetration into _Peru_, satisfying every where their thirst of
Gold, and slaughtering the Toothless _Tombezes_, a people who having
offended their King, had by his order the upper Teeth of the whole
Nation beaten out.

[Sidenote: Notable Stratagem of the _Peruvians_.]

[Sidenote: Wickedness of a Woman.]

[Sidenote: _Guatimala_ destroy’d by a flood.]

[Sidenote: _Velasques’_ Journey.]

_Peter Alvarado_ inform’d concerning the Riches of _Peru_, and well
knowing how to insinuate with the Emperor in his fawning Letters, at
last by his Friends so prevail’d, that he also got leave to go thither;
in pursuance of which, _Anno 1534._ he Weigh’d Anchor with seven Ships
from _Guatimala_, a City built by him between two Mountains. But Landing
at _Puerto Viejo_, and Marching Easterly over Snowy Mountains, he was
met by _Almagro_, between whom a bloody incounter was like to have
happen’d, but after some time, a Treaty being set a Foot, they came to a
Composition on these Articles: That _Alvarado_ upon the receipt of a
hundred thousand Duckets, should leave his Men with _Almagro_, and
depart from _Peru_; with which sum, being inrich’d, he soon after fitted
out fourteen Sail to discover new Countreys to the West; but being busie
in his preparations, was sent for to _Mexico_ by _Don Antonio Mendoza_
the Vice-Roy, to undertake a Voyage with him to the new-discover’d
Countrey of _Sibolla_, abounding in Gold and Saffron, according to the
report of four _Dominican_ Monks; and having already rais’d seven
hundred Men, news came to _Mexico_, that _Peter Zunica_ had receiv’d an
overthrow by the _Indians_ of _Salisco_; to whose assistance _Alvarado_
March’d with all speed, and found the _Indians_ incamp’d on a high
Mountain, fortifi’d with conjoyn’d Trees, and great Stones ty’d together
with Rushes, behind which they were secure from Shot. The _Spaniards_
climbing up the Mountain, approach’d their Works, when on a sudden the
Defendants giving a great Shout, cut the Cords which held their
Fortification together, whereupon the Stones and Trees tumbled down with
such force, that they kill’d both Men and Horse, few escaping alive: In
this conflict _Alvarado_ himself was lost. His Wife _Beatrix Cuova_ made
a stately Funeral for her Husband, and caus’d her House to be Painted
black, refusing either to Eat or Drink for a set time, yet
notwithstanding, all her pretence of sorrow, she so minded her business,
that she took the Government of _Guatimala_ into her own hands; but her
Dominion lasted not long, for on the eighteenth of _September, Anno
1541._ happen’d a hideous Tempest of Wind and Rain, mixt with continual
Lightning, and horrible claps of Thunder, and what was more terrible,
was answer’d with roars and horrid bellowings from the caverns of the
Mountain, at whose foot _Guatimala_ stood. About midnight the Mountain
was deliver’d, whose Birth was the irruption of an Inundating River, a
precipitate torrent tumbling down full of Rocks and Stones, which
carry’d all before it, so that in few minutes _Guatimala_ was utterly
swept away, not the least mark remaining, nor any left alive except
_Alvarado_’s Bastard Daughter by an _Indian_; and in the adjacent
Fields, some few, and they maim’d, with broken Arms or Legs; after this
utter destruction, they re-built another _Guatimala_, three Leagues more
Easterly. But though _Alvarado_ was lost in this Enterprize, yet the
Voyage to _Sibolla_ was not laid aside, for _Francisco Velasques_
March’d thither with eight hundred Men, of which most were Horse, but
found nought else but Snowy Mountains and barren Plains, insomuch, that
his Men and Horses were starv’d for want of Provision; wherefore he
return’d without success to _Mexico_, having onely burnt some Villages,
and had several Rencounters with the Natives.

[Sidenote: _Attabaliba_’s message to _Pizarro_.]

But _Attabaliba_ a _Peruan_ Prince, inform’d of _Pizarro_ and
_Almagro_’s coming, commanded them both to depart out of his Kingdom;
but they not regarding it, march’d directly to _Caxamalca_, where
_Attabaliba_ kept his Court, who again sent other Messengers to them
with command to leave his Dominions. _Pizarro_ made answer, that he
could not obey any Commands but those of his Master the Emperor, who had
order’d him to speak with the King himself at his own Palace.

_Attabaliba_ hearing that _Pizarro_ resolv’d to come forward, sent him a
pair of Painted Shooes and Armlets, that he might put them on when he
appear’d before his Throne: Captain _Ferdinand Sotto_ march’d before
with twenty Horse, passing close on the Flank of _Attabaliba_’s Army:
The _Indians_ amaz’d at the prauncing of their Horses, retreated into
their Fortifications, but were for their cowardize immediately slain by
the King’s Order.

[Sidenote: His discourse with a _Spanish_ Bishop, and his apparel.]

_Sotto_ sent a Message to _Attabaliba_, That the _Spaniards_ desir’d
peaceably to Treat with him, to which he receiv’d answer, That no Peace
could be made, unless they restor’d the Gold and Silver to the Owners,
which they had Plunder’d from them, and forsook his Territories; which
so doing, they should have Audience the next day: Hereupon the Bishop
_Vincent de Villa Viridi_ was conducted into the Royal Palace, in the
City of _Caxamalca_, and brought before _Attabaliba_, who came thither
in great State, with a Guard of twenty five thousand Men; he was carry’d
on the Shoulders of his prime Nobles in a Sedan, about which hung
Garlands of Gold, and divers colour’d Feathers; himself was cloth’d in a
white loose Vest, without Sleeves; his Temples were bound with a red
Ribbon, with a long Tassel on his left Cheek; on his Fore-head stuck
three curious Feathers; before him March’d three hundred of his
Life-Guard, all in one Livery, who clear’d the way through which the
King was to pass. The before-mention’d Bishop carry’d in one Hand a
Cross, in the other a Book, discoursing with the King to this effect;
_That God is the Trinity_, Adam _the first Man_; _Christ Born of a
Virgin, dy’d on the Cross_; _the_ Pope _God’s Vice-Gerent, who according
to the Power he had from Heaven, had given_ Peru _to the Emperor_
Charles, _as also all other Countreys in_ America; _and if he should
prove obstinate, and resist, he must expect nothing less than utter
ruine_. _Attabaliba_ reply’d, _That he serv’d_ Pachamaca, _being the
Creator of all things; and next to him the Sun and Moon: How glorious do
they appear_ (said he) _in comparison of a Crucifi’d God? To make Peace
and Alliance with mighty Princes, was the true Foundation of wise
Government: But the_ Pope _must needs be senseless, devoy’d of all
reason, and withal highly unjust, to give away what was none of his
own_, viz. _other mens Kingdoms, in which he never had the least or
smallest concern. Moreover, he would not desert that Religion which he
and his Ancestors had maintain’d so many Ages, and the rather, because
there are no apparent or sufficient Testimony of the truth of
Christianity._ The latter clause was thus answer’d, saying, _This Book,
O King, which I hold in my hand, proves and declares all that you
question_. _Attabaliba_ looking upon it, turn’d it over Leaf by Leaf,
then look’d more intentively upon the Print, which done he clap’d it to
either Ear, and at last as altogether unsatisfi’d, in disdainful manner
threw it away.

But _Pizarro_ gaining time while the King and Bishop thus discours’d,
had drawn his Men in Battel-Array, his sixty Horse he divided into three
Wings, Commanded by his three Brothers, _Ferdinand_, _John_, and
_Gonzalvo Pizarro_, left the Captains _Sotto_ and _Bavalcazar_ in an
Ambuscade; _Peter de Canada_ march’d in the Van, and he himself in the
main Body, leaving _Sotto_ in the Rear.

[Illustration]

[Sidenote: _Pizarro_ fights with _Attabaliba_.]

[Sidenote: _Attabaliba_ taken prisoner.]

[Sidenote: Bids for his ransom an unvaluable treasure.]

So soon as the Bishop could acquaint them in what scornful manner
_Attabaliba_ had thrown his Holy Book, _The Word of God_, upon the
ground; both Armies were Engaged, whilst their Trumpets sounded, their
Drums beat, their Canons roar’d, the Horses neigh’d, and the Dogs
bark’d, they made a speedy march up against the Walls of _Taxamalca_,
which dreadful mixture of terrible noises struck such a Pannick fear
into the hearts of the _Indians_, that they all presently broke, in
their flight crowding one another to death at the Gates of the City,
which being too narrow to receive them, they themselves made breaches in
their own Walls to enter; which opportunity the _Spaniards_ no ways
neglected, but entering with them, shot and kill’d all they could reach;
their Dogs also having no little share in the slaughter; whole companies
of Indians were trode under the Horses feet, yet near _Attabaliba_’s
Chair was the greatest resistance, for no sooner fell one of the
Bearers, but immediately another supply’d the place; so that the King
was surrounded with heaps of his own slain Subjects, to whom _Pizarro_
himself Charg’d up so close, that having seiz’d him by his long Hair, he
pull’d him out of his Throne, and having gotten him under him, secur’d
immediately in Fetters; whereupon all his Life-Guard forsook him, and
fled: But the loss of the Battel, which was _Attabaliba_’s utter ruine,
was laid upon _Runninagui_, a Captain appointed to lie in Ambush, so to
fall in the Rear of the _Spaniards_ with five thousand men; but was so
far from performing his Orders, that terrifi’d at the uncouth noise of
the Guns, and the rest, that he fled one hundred and fifty Leagues
Southerly, before he stopt, or scarce ever look’d behind him in so long
a flight. Mean while, _Attabaliba_ compounded with _Pizarro_ for his
Ransom, _viz._ to pay him as much Gold as that Hall in his Court (where
they made the Agreement) could hold to the top; they first measur’d the
heighth, then the length, which was found to be fifty four Foot, and the
breadth nine: In pursuance of this composition, Gold was brought thither
from all places, according to _Attabaliba_’s order; yet he could not
raise so much as would perform his bargain, which made the _Spaniards_
to grumble: But _Attabaliba_ desiring some longer time to perform it,
telling _Pizarro_, that most of the Gold was brought on Slaves
Shoulders, a long and troublesome way, of two hundred Leagues long, from
the City _Cusco_, and if this would not satisfie, _Pizarro_ might send
some of his own people thither, to inform him, that he need not fear the
least danger, as long as he was Prisoner with his Wife and Children.

The two Captains, _Sotto_, and _Peter del Baro_ being sent away to that
purpose, met after some days Journey with one of _Attabaliba_’s Leaders,
who was bringing the King’s Brother _Guascar_ with a Party, Prisoner to
_Caxamalca_.

[Sidenote: Burns his Brother _Guascar_ alive.]

_Guascar_ had now a fair opportunity to crave assistance of the
_Spaniards_, telling them, that he and _Attabaliba_ were the Sons of
_Guaynacava_, so that the Kingdom was to be divided betwixt both. But
_Attabaliba_ had by force made himself Master of all, whereas he being
the youngest, ought to be satisfi’d with that share which _Guascar_,
being the eldest, would assign him; for the right of Inheritance
belong’d justly to him, and yet he was carry’d away bound to slaughter:
But if _Pizarro_ would do justice in delivering him out of his Brothers
bloody Hands, he would raise him thrice as much Gold as _Attabaliba_ had
promis’d: To which purpose he desir’d _Sotto_ and _Baro_ to put off
their Journey to _Cusco_; which they not daring to do, went on their
way, and _Guascar_ descending the Valley _Sucsuhuana_, was burnt alive
by _Attabaliba_’s Soldiers.

Mean while, _Almagro_ came with fresh Forces to _Taxamalca_, which
occasion’d no small trouble in _Pizarro_, who was onely thirsty after
Gold: On the other side, _Almagro_ as greedy, grew jealous that
_Pizarro_ should keep the promis’d Hall full of Gold for himself, and he
should have no share, because _Attabaliba_ was his Prisoner; therefore
he earnestly desir’d that _Attabaliba_ might privately be made away, and
that the Booty might be divided to one as well as the other.

[Sidenote: An incredible sum of Money given to the Soldiers.]

[Sidenote: _Attabaliba_ strangled.]

_Pizarro_ to prevent all inconveniencies that might happen from his
dissenting, gave in the presence of the King to every private Soldier a
thousand Duckets in Gold, and six thousand five hundred twenty five
Silver Crowns; the inferior Officers receiv’d four and thirty thousand
Crowns, and the others sixty thousand; the fifth part of the Booty he
reserv’d for the Emperor: And notwithstanding _Attabaliba_ perform’d his
promise in filling the Hall full of Gold, yet he had the sentence of
Death pronounc’d against him; neither would his excuse of Innocency
serve, or his Requests to be sent to _Spain_, there to clear himself
before the Emperor; but sighing, and lamenting his misfortunes, was ty’d
to a Post, and Strangled in the presence of _Pizarro_. For whose Death,
though a _Heathen_, Divine Vengeance pursu’d these cruel and unjust
Arbitrators that thus made their Will a Law, none of them dying a
natural Death.

Moreover it was observ’d, that a few days before this Execution a
blazing Star appear’d, which _Attabaliba_ seeing, presaging sadly of
himself said, _That a great Prince would die in a short time_; but
_Pizarro_’s chief pretences for the Kings just suffering was, that he
had cruelly murder’d his Brother _Guascar_: But this was a meer blind,
for that that incens’d them against _Attabaliba_, was, that he knowing
where the unvaluable treasure lay, which _Guascar_ had bury’d, would not
discover it to them.

[Sidenote: Cruelty of _Ruminagui_.]

[Sidenote: _Pizarro_ puts _Quizquiz_ to flight.]

[Sidenote: And takes _Cusco_.]

[Sidenote: Unvaluable Treasures taken.]

[Sidenote: Remarkable passage of a Dog.]

_Attabaliba_, before his death, desir’d that he might be bury’d in the
Territory _Quito_, by his Father _Guaynacava_, whom the _Peruvians_ for
his great Justice and Prudence in Government, believed that he would
arise, and settle the World so troubled and full of disorder in peace
and quiet: The Corps was accordingly carry’d thither in great State
after their manner, attended by his Brother, whom _Illescas Ruminagui_
which ran from _Attabaliba_ in the Battel, where he lay in ambush when
he might have done them good service; in the way to his entertainment,
receiv’d with all shews of sorrow; but when they were feasted to excess,
bury’d in sleep and Wine, he Massacred and flea’d _Illescas_ the Kings
Brother alive, and made a Taber of his Skin. Whilst _Attabaliba_’s
Funeral was thus bloodily solemniz’d, his General _Quizquiz_ rais’d a
great Army, which _Pizarro_ encountring after a valiant resistance,
totally routed; then marching victoriously to _Cusco_, he saw great
Fires in the City, and the Citizens fighting with the _Spaniards_, sent
before; but the Horse breaking in upon them, most of them fled the next
morning to the Mountains: Thus the _Spaniards_ became Masters of the
City, where they inflicted the most cruel tortures on all Sexes, by that
means to force them to discover, if they knew of any hidden Treasures,
being not satisfi’d with what they found there, although they had gotten
a greater Treasure in _Cusco_ than that that they had extorted from
_Attabaliba_ before: Nay, they gave those that were murther’d for Food
to their Dogs: Among the rest, _Didacus Salazar_ having a very fierce
Dog call’d _Bezerril_, had also an old _Indian_ Woman his Prisoner, to
whom he gave a Letter to deliver to the General _Pizarro_; the Woman had
not gone many Paces before she was set upon by _Bezerril_, whom
_Salazar_ let loose, that he might delight himself in seeing the Dog
tear the poor old Woman; but she observing him come running at her with
so great fierceness, fell down upon her Knees, and holding forth the
Letter, cry’d, _Good my Lord, good my Lord Dog, I must carry this Letter
to General_ Pizarro, whereupon the furious Curr having more compassion
than the _Spaniard_, stood still a little, and at last lifted up his Leg
in a scornful manner, Urin’d upon her, and return’d satisfi’d; at which
sportive behavior of the Cur and the Chrone, _Salazar_ laughing, was so
well pleas’d, that he gave the Woman her life.

[Sidenote: _Almagro_’s unhappy Journey.]

[Sidenote: King’s Town.]

After _Cusco_ had been sufficiently Plunder’d, _Pizarro_ made _Almagro_
Governor thereof, with the Territories belonging to it, and built near
the River _Lima_ a Town, which they call’d _Los Reyes_. Mean while,
_Almagro_ receiv’d Letters Patent from the Emperor, in which he was
nominated _Marshal_ of _Peru_; encourag’d by that honor, he took a great
design in hand, for the _Peruvians_ had reported, that the Golden
_Chili_ lay to the South; and _Almagro_ being encourag’d, and assisted
by _Pizarro_, March’d inquest thereof with two Troops of Horse, and five
hundred Foot: But mean while there happen’d so great Rains, and such
foul Weather, that the Ways were almost unpassable, so that the
Expedition grew very troublesome; yet however he went on, in which hard
March he lost both Horse and Men.

[Sidenote: _Mango Inga_ takes _Cusco_.]

[Sidenote: Contest between _Almagro_ and _Pizarro_.]

[Sidenote: _Almagro_ strangled.]

Whilst _Almagro_ was upon this undertaking, _Francisco Pizarro_ receiv’d
Letters Patent from the Emperor, in which he was Intitul’d _Duke of
Peru_, but with a _Salvo_ for the honor before given to _Almagro_; yet
these balanc’d honors bred great dissention between the Duke and
Marshal, which _Mango Inga_ another of _Attabaliba_’s Brothers
observing, laid hold of the opportunity, and setting upon the _Spanish_
Garrison in _Cusco_, took the City. Whereupon _Pizarro_ immediately sent
his Horse thither, under the Command of _Alphonso Alvarado_, and _Gomes
de Todoya_, against whom the _Indians_ fought very valiantly, insomuch,
that the Battel was a long time doubtful; yet at last the _Spaniards_
got a bloody Victory, and regain’d _Cusco_; hither after some time,
_Almagro_ returning with ill success, having effected nothing, was kept
out by _Ferdinand Pizarro_, under pretence that he could not open the
Gate without Order from his Brother the Duke. _Almagro_ much offended
thereat, yet saying little, was so privately let into the City, that he
surpriz’d the Governor _Ferdinand Pizarro_, and his Brother _Gonsalvo_,
with _Alphonso Alvarado_ Prisoners; swearing that he would not rest
before he had rooted all the _Pizarro_’s out of Peru. But whilst he was
passing the intended Sentence of Death upon them, _Gonsalvo_ and
_Alvarado_ broke Prison; and got away to the Duke, who troubled for his
Brother _Ferdinand_ there in custody, and in danger of his life, came to
Composition; whereupon _Ferdinand_ was also releas’d: But this was no
sooner done, and he had got his Brother safe there, but the Duke
regarding nothing less than the keeping of the new-made Peace, sent to
_Almagro_, that the Emperor having given him the prime Command over
_Peru_, he requir’d him to leave _Cusco_, or else he would force him.
_Almagro_ sent answer, That if he could see the Emperor’s Hand, he would
immediately obey, otherwise not; whereupon both Parties prepar’d for
War, wherein they had many sharp bickerings in a short time: But
_Almagro_ being too weak fell into the Dukes hands, who order’d him to
be strangled in the Gaol, and his body afterwards to be drawn to the
Market-place, and there publickly Beheaded.

_Ferdinand Pizarro_ being not long after sent to _Spain_, with the
fifths of the gotten Treasure for the Emperor, was Imprison’d in the
Castle _Motto_, for _Almagro_’s Death: But what further happen’d to him
there, or became of him, hath never been Recorded by any Pen.

[Sidenote: _Ferdinand Pizarro_ never obtains his liberty.]

[Sidenote: Young _Almagro_ stabs the Duke.]

But young _Almagro_, instigated by his Guardian _John Rada_, resolving,
to be reveng’d for his Fathers Death; to that purpose he went to _Los
Reyes_, where by the help of some hir’d Male-contents, he design’d to
Murder the Duke upon St. _John_’s day, in the Church at high Service:
But this business was not so closely carry’d, but the Duke had some
inkling thereof, who therefore stay’d at home, and went not to Mass that
day. The Conspirators doubting the event, hearing that their Plot was
discover’d, though defeated in their purpose, yet not fail’d in their
Courage, ran at noon day to the Palace, crying, _Kill the Tyrant, kill
the Traytor_. But _Pizarro_ being so much forewarn’d, had lock’d up the
Gates, and arm’d himself, which when they could not enter, yet they went
back through the City, and waving a bloody Sword, cry’d, _Pizarro is
slain_; this being believ’d, above two hundred private Friends to
_Almagro_ appear’d, who all ran to the Palace, crouding about the Gates:
And _Francisco de Chares_ coming out at a private Door, hoping to
pacifie the Mutineers, was immediately Stab’d; but they rushing in the
way he came, found some stout opposition, for seven Halberdiers of his
Guard fought till they were all kill’d in the Dukes presence; but
_Pizarro_ was taken alive, and being brought before _Almagro_, he
Savagely Butcher’d him with his own hands; which done, they ran crying
along the Streets, _Long live the Emperor, and_ Didacus Almagro.

[Sidenote: Great slaughter in _Los Reye_.]

But after all this, _Pizarro_’s Party joyning together, valiantly
withstood the Conspirators, so that a considerable number were slain on
both sides, yet _Almagro_ at last getting the better, confiscated the
Goods of all those that were against him; and now every one shew’d him
the respect of Chief Governor, till the Emperor should either settle
him, or send another.

From hence Marching to _Cusco_, he had like to have paid for all, but
prevented by private intelligence thereof; which happen’d thus,

[Sidenote: Strange Transactions between _Alvarado_, _Sotello_, and
           _Almagro_.]

[Sidenote: Fight between _Castro_ and _Almagro_.]

[Sidenote: _Castro_’s Cruelty.]

_Garcias Alvarado_ and _Christopher Sotello_ were Joynt-Governors of
_Cusco_; but quarrelling, and coming to Blows in like manner, _Sotello_
was slain: This _Almagro_ took very hainously, as being his intimate
Friend, giving forth threatning Speeches of Revenge; which _Alvarado_
inform’d of, and intending some way or other to prevent all Dangers, and
save himself, he invited _Almagro_ to a Feast, but privately resolving
to make it a Bloody Banquet, by his Death at the Table. Of this he being
inform’d, as we mention’d before, staid at home, and privately sent for
some Soldiers that had belong’d to _Sotello_, sending word that he was
indispos’d: _Alvarado_, under a shew of Kindness, goes to _Almagro_,
hoping to perswade him to come to his prepar’d Treat; but so soon as he
was enter’d the Hall, they clapp’d to the Gate, and the Soldiers falling
upon _Alvarado_, slew him: But soon after _Almagro_ was call’d in
question, and not long enjoy’d this his usurp’d Authority; for the
Emperor _Charles_ sending the Learned _Vacca de Castro_ with full
Authority to _Peru_, to settle that disturb’d Kingdom, _Almagro_ now
us’d to Govern, had no Ears to become a Subject; therefore he march’d
with an Army to meet _Castro_, by whom, after a bloody Fight, being
beaten and put to flight, having four thousand Men, he fell into the
Victors Hands near _Cusco_, where he was treated very severely; for
shortly after he was condemn’d to be Beheaded; others were strangled,
and some torn in pieces with Horses.

[Sidenote: _Vela_ Vice-Roy of _Peru_.]

[Sidenote: Murders _Xuarez_.]

[Sidenote: Is taken and put in Prison.]

Not long after this great Execution, _Blasco Nunnez Vela_ came to
_Peru_, and being appointed Vice-Roy, had four Councellors assign’d him,
with whom he was to consult in all Affairs; and especially to set the
_Indians_ at liberty, which till then had suffer’d much misery under the
_Spanish_ Tyranny: To perform which, the Emperor had given an Order
under his Great Seal, which was to be publish’d and proclaim’d in all
Places. _Vela_ at his arrival faithfully perform’d all his Commands,
seiz’d upon _Vacca de Castro_, because he had Executed _Almagro_ without
any Examination or Tryal; yet by this means he got the hatred of all, so
that most of the _Spaniards_ chose _Gonsalvo Pizarro_ for their Chief,
whereby Affairs grew daily more and more out of Order. _Nunnez Vela_
laid all the blame thereof upon _William Xuarez_, Governor of _Lima_,
whom he sent for in the Night, and correcting over-severely, gave him
also two mortal Wounds, of which he presently died: The Body was in the
Morning drawn along the Streets, which caus’d so great a murmuring
amongst the Inhabitants, that soon after they seem’d to make a general
Insurrection: Wherefore _Nunnez Vela_ fearing the worst, resolv’d to
convey himself from thence _incognito_, and pass to _Truxillo_: But his
four Councellors advis’d him to the contrary; yet he took his own way,
causing all his Treasure to be sent aboard; and having made ready his
Horses to depart, the Common People in a tumultuous manner set upon the
Palace, catching, snatching up, and carrying away all the Silver they
could find, and meeting the Vice-Roy, seiz’d, and thrust him into a
Dungeon; which done, they fell at variance amongst themselves; for some
would have him executed, but others insisted to have him sent Prisoner
to _Spain_; which last being the more moderate, getting the upper Hand,
_Vela_ was put aboard, and committed to the custody of _Didacus
Alvarez_, who Anchoring in the Mouth of the River _Tombez_ (kindness
growing betwixt them) releas’d the Vice-Roy his Prisoner, and set him
ashore, who not long after got some Forces together.

[Sidenote: Is Beheaded.]

Mean while _Pizarro_ was every where acknowledg’d for Supreme Governor,
who having Intelligence of the Vice-Roys Design, sent _Francisco
Carvayales_ thither, between whom and _Vela_ was a sharp Encounter; but
at last being worsted, and retaken by _Carvayales_, he was soon after
executed, and his Head plac’d on a Pole near the Gallows.

The Emperor _Charles_ turmoil’d with Wars at home, saw no likelyhood to
settle the confus’d Affairs of _Peru_; yet at last he thought it
convenient to send one _Peter Gasca_ thither, an Ecclesiastick, of a
subtile and ingenious Wit, who landing _Anno 1546._ in _Lima_, with no
other Title than _Chief Councellor to the Emperor_, took quite another
course than _Vela_, perswading them all, that Affairs should be setled
in order, according to their own desires, and former Miscarriages never
be remembred, being utterly deleted by an Act of Oblivion.

[Sidenote: _Gasca_’s murderous Exploits.]

[Sidenote: _Gonsalves Pizarro_ strangled.]

[Sidenote: Cruelty us’d on _Carvayales_.]

The News of this General Pardon spreading it self far and near, wrought
a great change; for _Pizarro_’s Intimates, and those nearest of Concern,
shrunk daily from him; which _Gasca_ observing, march’d against him; and
that they might make the more haste, they loaded several _Peruvians_,
chain’d, with their Arms, whom when they lagg’d, they switch’d and
whipp’d before them. And now both Armies being met, and discharging
their Cannons at one another, with considerable loss to each side, whole
Regiments came running over to _Gasca_; so that _Pizarro_ being quite
forsaken, yielded himself to the mercy of the Conqueror, who accus’d him
of High Treason, and caus’d him to be strangled in a Dungeon, and fix’d
his Head on a Marble Pillar in _Lima_, environ’d with Iron Rails, and
inscrib’d with a brief Account of all his Offences. But _Gasca_ not thus
satisfied, hang’d up several Commanders, and whipping and stigmatizing
others, condemn’d them after to the Gallies: But his greatest spight was
against the Field-Marshal _Carvayales_, a Person of the Age of fourscore
years, whom tying to a Horses Tail, he caus’d a whole Hour to be drawn
up and down the Market-place, scorn’d and derided of all People; which
done, he was quarter’d alive.

Not long after _Gasca_ surrendred the Command of _Peru_ to the Learned
_Cianca_, and carried an unvaluable Treasure to _Germany_, for the
Emperor _Charles_, who gave him in requital for his faithful Service,
the Bishoprick of _Valentia_.

  _The Expeditions of_ John Stade, _and_ Nicholas Durando Villegagnon.

[Sidenote: _Stade_ taken by the _Cannibals_.]

[Sidenote: His strange Entertainment amongst them.]

About the same time that _Gasca_ arriv’d in _Spain_, _John Stade_ had
the Command over a small Fort rais’d of Stone and Earth, on the Island
_Maro_, adjacent to _Brasile_, because the Salvage People of _Tupin
Imba_ sail’d twice a year from the Countrey of Brikioka, to _Maro_, at
the time when the Plant Abbati was ripe, of which they made the Liquor
that they generally drink at their Humane Banquets: They also landed on
Maro about the _Bratti_-Fishing. This _Bratti_ is a Fish of a very
delicious taste, either caught in Nets, or shot by the _Tupin Imba_, and
carried to their several Habitations. Against these People _Stade_ kept
a continual Guard, when _Heliodorus Hesse_, Son to _Eobanus Hesse_, the
famous _Latin_ Poet in _Germany_, came to visit him. _Stade_ to
entertain his Guest the better, went into the Woods to hunt for Venison,
where he was taken by the _Tupin Imba_, of which the King march’d in the
Rear with a great Palm-Tree Club, and carried him towards the Sea side,
that he, with others that waited on the Shore, might make up a
_Kawewipepicke_ (that is, _A Feast of Rosted Men_) But because _Stade_
being a _German_ of a large Body, well-skinn’d, young, plump and fat,
they all concluded to spare this Dainty, and carry him alive to
_Brikioka_, that with such a Banquet they might highly caress their
Wives: But the Journey being long, and a just melancholy possessing him
with fear, and the terror of certain death, and to be Food for such
ravenous _Cannibals_, so macerated and consum’d him, that he was almost
dwindled away to Skin and Bone; whereupon thinking him thus lean to make
but few savory Morsels, they chang’d their resolutions, and growing
better acquainted, he having learn’d their Tongue, and being able to
discourse with them, they lik’d his company so well, that they let him
live amongst them. Nine years _Stade_ had been a Slave amongst these
Man-eaters, when the _French_ coming thither, bought him for a few
Trifles, and carried him to _Normandy_, where landing _Anno 1555._ he
went from thence to _Hamburgh_, being his Native Countrey.

[Sidenote: _Durande_’s Expedition.]

[Sidenote: Dissention in the new Colony.]

[Sidenote: Wickedness of _Cointak_ against the Ministers.]

[Sidenote: _Durande_ drowns three Religious Men.]

_Nicholas Durande_ a _Frenchman_ set Sail from _Havre de Grace_, at the
same time when _Stade_ came thither. This _Durande_ having lost a Castle
in _Brittain_, to the great prejudice of the _French_, out of a pretence
of advancing their Affairs, and to fill up their almost exhausted
Treasury, reported, That the _Spanish_ and _Portuguese_ Forces were
driven out of _India_, where they had gather’d so much Wealth; and it
would certainly redound to the Honor and Profit of _France_, if they
could become Masters of the Gold and Silver Mines. King _Henry_ the
Second approving of the Proposal, and the more because the Admiral
_Gasper Coligni_ was also very earnest, looking upon it as a safe
Retreat for the Protestants, at that time cruelly persecuted: and
_Durande_, sensible of the Admirals thoughts, privately inform’d him,
That in his _American_ Design he chiefly aim’d to plant a True Church of
God in _America_, where the Professors might enjoy themselves peaceably.
This Report being spread amongst those that call’d themselves
_Protestants_, (fled from _Switzerland_ in great numbers to _France_)
made many of them venture upon the Design; who having fitted themselves,
and setting sail with three Ships, after some time arriv’d on the Coast
of _Brasile_, and landed on the _Rock-Island_, in the Haven _Januario_:
Here _Durande_ built several Watch-houses, and the Fort _Coligni_, which
he fortified with a considerable number of Guns: Not long after he writ
to _John Calvin_, That he would please to furnish this new Plantation in
_Brasile_ with good and able Teachers of the Gospel; which Request being
immediately taken into serious consideration by the Classes, one _Philip
Corguileray_, a Gentleman near _Geneva_, set Sail out of the Haven
_Honfleurs_, with three Ships, freighted with some Provisions, several
Persons of divers Trades, and two Ministers, _Peter Richer_, and
_William Chartier_: But he had scarce made _Africa_, when they began to
have a scarcity of Victuals; wherefore they turn’d their Design of
setling the Gospel in _America_, to Pyracy, where they made small
scruple or difference, whether Friends or Foes, but made Prize of all
they could light upon, though indeed their Ministers both preach’d and
perswaded the contrary, amongst whom a Controversie happening, put other
Business into their Heads; for one _John Cointak_, formerly a _Parisian
Sorbonist_, was also amongst those that remov’d from _Geneva_, who
pretended that _Coligni_ had promis’d him a Ministers place, so soon as
he landed at _Brasile_; but _Richer_ and _Chartier_, not satisfied that
there was any such Promise, and consequently thinking themselves not
obliged by his bare Assertion, told him, That themselves being able,
under God, to perform the Work, they needed no such Coadjutor: This bred
so great a Rancor between them, that _Cointak_ accus’d them for teaching
false Doctrine, and chiefly that they did not mix the Wine at their
Sacraments with Water, which Father _Clemens_ had strictly commanded.
_Durande_, being prevail’d on by the Cardinal of _Lorein_, joyn’d with
_Cointak_, and thereupon so sharply persecuted the _Protestants_, that
he starv’d several of them, which others to escape fled to the
_Brasilians_: Nay, he took _John Du Bordell_, _Matthias Vermeil_, and
_Peter Bourdon_, out of their Sick-Beds, and tying their Hands and Feet,
threw them headlong from a Rock into the Sea: Soon after which, the
bloody Persecutor return’d with ill success to _France_, where he wrote
a Book against the Reform’d Religion; but all the Honor which he gain’d
was, that all Parties on both sides accounted him a distracted Person.


                              SECT. XIII.
   _The Expeditions of_ John Ribald, Renatus Laudonier, _and_ Gurgie.

[Sidenote: _Florida_ unhappily discover’d.]

[Sidenote: _Ribald_’s Voyage.]

[Sidenote: The Garrison in _Florida_ in great want.]

[Sidenote: Unheard-of Hunger.]

_Florida_ being upon the Continent of _America_, and so call’d by _John
Pontæus_, who landed there upon _Palm-Sunday_, though _Sebastian Gaboto_
a _Venetian_, imploy’d by _Henry_ the Seventh King of _England_, landed
there before, may well be term’d _the_ Europeans _Bloody Stage_,
_Pontæus_ being slain here: But _Ferdinand Sotto_ exercis’d against the
Inhabitants inhumane Cruelty five years together; yet at last died of a
deep discontent, because he could not reach his Aims, having condemn’d
so many _Floridans_ fruitlesly to dig for Gold in the Mines. However,
since that, _Julian Sumanus_ and _Peter Ahumada_ undertook the Work
anew, but with the like bad Success. _Anno 1545._ one _Lodowick
Cancello_, a _Dominican_, thought to effect great things with four of
his Associates; but landing on _Florida_, was destroy’d by the Natives.
But _Gasper Coligni_ the Marshal, neither discourag’d by these miserable
Proceedings, nor the former Treachery of _Durande_, prepar’d for a new
Expedition thither; and accordingly _John Ribald_ was fitted with two
Ships from _Diep_, at the Charge of _Charles_ the Ninth King of
_France_, wherewith having sail’d thirty Degrees Northern Latitude, he
came before the Promontory of _Francisco_, where he ran up into the
Mouth of a wide River, to which he gave the denomination of _Dolphin_,
upon whose Banks were whole Mulberry-Woods, which nourish’d Silk-Worms
in strange abundance. From hence he sail’d by the _Wolves Head_ (a Point
so call’d, because great numbers of Wolves breed there) and leaving the
_Cedar-Island_, landed on _Florida_, where he built a Triangular Fort,
and having furnish’d it with Men, Guns, and Provisions, sail’d back for
more Supplies to _France_; but coming thither, found all things in
disorder, occasion’d by a War amongst themselves; so that the _French_
which guarded and dwelt in the Fort, waited in vain for Relief, and
their Provisions growing scant, thought it fittest and their best way to
build a Vessel, and sail from thence; which having effected, and being
gone about the third part of their Voyage there hapned such a Calm for
twenty Days, that they made not the least way, which drove them to so
great extremity, their Provisions being spent, that they drank their own
Urine, and fed upon their old Shoes, which also in a short time failing,
they agreed amongst themselves to kill and eat one of their Sea-men,
call’d _Henry Lacher_, on whose Flesh they liv’d some days; but being
again driven to the greatest want imaginable, in this extremity of
Desparation, their Condition being altogether hopeless, an _English_
Frigat discovering them, and observing by their manner of Sailing that
they were in some great want, drawing near, sent their Long-boat aboard,
and found them so weak, that they were not able to handle their Tack;
whereupon generously taking pity of them, they reliev’d them, and
conducted them to the Coast of England, and then brought them to Queen
_Elizabeth_, who had formerly design’d to rig a Fleet for _Florida_.

[Sidenote: _Laudonier_’s Voyage.]

[Sidenote: Remarkable difference in the _French_ Fleet.]

Mean while, no News having been heard of the foremention’d _French_
Plantation in _Brasile_, and _Coligni_’s Difference with the King being
decided, he prevail’d so much, that _Renatus Laudonier_ should with
three Ships sail to relieve the Garrison in the late deserted Fort.
_Laudonier_ landing in _Nova Francia_, found a Stone with a _French_
Inscription, plac’d on the Shore by _Ribald_, and hung full of Laurel
Garlands: Then he visited the King _Saturiona_, whose Son _Atorcus_ had
several Children by his own Mother, according to a Salvage Custom
observ’d in that Countrey. Whilst they stay’d here, a Fiery Meteor
appear’d in the Sky, with such fervor, that some Rivers boyl’d with the
heat of it, and the Fish parboyl’d, died; nay more, it scorch’d all the
Plants far and near: The Natives ascrib’d this Plague to the _French_
Cannons, by which means they stood in great fear of the _French_, who
might have done great things had not they differ’d amongst themselves;
For a Sea-man nam’d _Rubel Patracon_, pretending to have skill in
_Necromancy_, would undertake to shew the Places where the Gold and
Silver Mines were, which the rest of the Sea-men believing, rebell’d
against _Laudonier_, and though sick, imprison’d him, forcing him to
sign a Writing to this effect, That the two Ships, of which the Rebels
made _Vassar_ and _Trincant_ Commanders, should with his leave and
permittance sail to _New Spain_ for Provisions. Whilst they were
preparing for their Voyage, _Rupiferrir_ having been sent to the King
_Utina_, came back with many rich Presents, and withal brought
Information of the Gold and Silver Mynes _Apalatica_; but _Vassar_ and
_Trincant_ taking no notice thereof, set forth, and took a _Spanish_
Carvel, richly laden before _Havana_, whose Commander they agreed to
release on the payment of a great Ransom; but the Masters Son being sent
ashore to fetch the Money which they had agreed for, in stead thereof,
made his Fathers Mischance known; whereupon two great Frigats and a
Galley were the next Morning very early sent to attaque the _French_,
between whom was a sharp Encounter; but in a short time the two Pyrats
were sunk, and the Prisoners sold for Slaves, excepting a few that
escap’d in their Long-boat.

[Sidenote: Great cruelty of the _Spaniards_ against the _French_.]

[Sidenote: _Gurgie_’s valiant Exploits against the _Spaniards_.]

In this interim _Laudonier_ receiving no Supply from _France_, was
brought to great extremity; for the Rebels had carried great part of his
Store with them. In these straights he was forc’d by those that staid
with him, contrary to the Articles of Peace lately made with King
_Utina_, to take him Prisoner, in hopes that for his Liberty he would
procure them some Provisions; but the Inhabitants incens’d at the
baseness of so unexpected an Action, could not be wrought upon by any
means to give them Relief; but grown more perverse than before,
appointed a general Meeting to elect another King; so that out of all
hopes, they utterly gave themselves over for lost. In this desperate
condition, _John Haukins_, a great Sea-Captain, came thither with four
_English_ Ships, who pitying their misery, furnish’d them with
Necessaries, and having onely four Vessels, lent them one, because
_Laudonier_ was at that time too weak to endure the Sea; but not long
after recovering strength, and all things ready to set Sail, _Ribald_
came to an Anchor before _Charles-Fort_, with seven Ships from _Diep_:
Within few days after, the _Spanish_ Admiral _Peter Melandez_ arriv’d
with eight Frigats, whereof the French having Intelligence, cut their
Cables, and stood out to Sea, whom the _Spaniards_ chac’d, but could not
reach; whereupon leaving them, they landed in the Mouth of the River
_Dolphin_, where by help of the _Moorish_ Slaves they began to intrench
themselves; of which _Ribald_ having notice, immediately sail’d thither,
at least to disturb, if not absolutely drive them from their Work; but
surpriz’d in the way by a great Storm, lost most of his Fleet, ingag’d
among the Rocks; yet the Men were most of them sav’d. In this Storm the
_Spaniards_ also suffer’d great damage, yet made an Advantage of the
_Frenchmens_ Misfortune, marching with all speed to _Charles-Fort_, in
which were onely two hundred weak Men, _Ribald_ having taken the primest
Soldiers along with him. In the Morning before Sun-rise the _Spaniards_
made a fierce Assault, and in a short time became Masters of the Place,
which _Laudonier_ seeing, fled in a Boat; others leaping from the Walls
into the Moat, sav’d themselves by swimming: Whoever fell into the
Victors Hands, was without mercy slain; nay, such was the _Spaniards_
inveterate malice to the _French_, that wanting living Bodies, they
exercis’d their Cruelty upon the dead, pulling out their Eyes, and
cutting off their Members, carrying them in Triumph on the Points of
their Swords. In the interim, the Storm ceasing, _Ribald_ approach’d
_Charles-Fort_, with his shatter’d Fleet, but was so amaz’d when he saw
the _Spanish_ Flag set upon the Walls, and _Vallemond_ marching towards
him with a Squadron of _Spaniards_, that although a River lay between
them, yet he presently came to a Treaty, and deliver’d up all his Men,
being above four hundred, upon promise of good Quarter; but the
_Spaniards_ in stead of keeping their Agreement, bound them, leading
them all to the Castle, where, both against their Articles, and the Law
of Arms, they massacred them, and burnt their Bodies; but _Ribald_ being
quarter’d, they fix’d his Limbs upon Poles about the Walls, sending his
Head to _Sevil_. When _Charles_ the Ninth, King of _France_, receiv’d
notice hereof, he was not in the least concern’d at the _Spanish_
Cruelty us’d to his Subjects, out of a particular hatred to _Coligni_,
the first Promoter of the Voyage. But though the _French_ Crown so
little regarded the inhumane Usage committed by the _Spaniards_ in
_Charles-Fort_, yet _Dominicus Gurgie_ shew’d himself so highly
concern’d thereat, that turning all his Goods into Money, he levied two
hundred Soldiers, and fourscore Sea-men, which he put aboard three small
Ships, pretending that he would onely touch at _Brasile_; but sailing
beyond _Cuba_, he stood directly for _Florida_, where after his Landing
he was kindly receiv’d by _Saturiona_ the King, who complaining much
against the _Spaniards_ Oppressions, sent to joyn with him his Kinsman
_Olotocara_, having the Command of a great Army.

[Sidenote: Is ungratefully rewarded.]

The _Spaniards_ by this time had not onely strengthned _Charles-Fort_,
but also rais’d two others on each side of the River _Mayo_, in which
three Holds lay Garrison’d above four hundred choice Soldiers. Those in
the new Forts made little resistance; but quitting the same, and flying
into a neighboring Wood, fell into an Ambuscade of _Indians_, who slew
thirty of them, and preserv’d ninety for a Publick Execution. Thus they
march’d on victoriously to _Charles-Fort_, where by the way sixty
_Spaniards_ sallying out, were every one cut off, which much facilitated
the _Frenchmens_ Work. The Governor _Melandez_, seeing a certain ruine
attend him, fled into the Woods; but met there by the _Floridans_,
return’d to the _French_, of whom he begg’d Life for himself, and some
of his People: Yet _Gurgie_ deaf to all intreaties, would hear nothing,
but pressing on, took them all Prisoners, and as a just Reward of their
Cruelty to his Countrey-men, hang’d them on the next Trees: After which
Execution, it can scarce be express’d how kindly the Natives entertain’d
the _French_, because they had freed the Countrey from the _Spanish_
Oppressions. Thus having accomplish’d his Design, and returning home, he
was nobly receiv’d at _Rochel_, but had not the least Countenance for
all his trouble from the King; the Cardinal of _Lorein_ telling him,
_That for his good Service he ought to suffer death, because he had
fitted out three Ships upon his own Account, without Authority_.


                               SECT. XIV.
      _Four_ English _Expeditions, under the Conduct of our Famous
  Sea-Captains_ Martin Forbisher, _Sir_ Francis Drake, Thomas Candish,
                           _and_ John Smith.

[Sidenote: _Forbisher_’s Expedition.]

Captain _Forbisher_ sailing to the Northern Parts of _America_, _Anno
1576._ chusing a bad time, the Year being too much spent, and the Ocean
so full of Ice, that it forc’d him to return to _England_: Not many
Months after, he renew’d his Voyage, Queen _Elizabeth_ having rigg’d
out, and sent under his Command one Frigat and two Ketches, Mann’d with
a hundred and forty Men: The twenty sixth of _May_ he weigh’d Anchor,
and sail’d to the _Orkenies_, lying to the North of _Scotland_, where
landing, he found the poor Islanders fled out of their Huts, into Caves
and Dens among the Rocks. From thence he steer’d North-North-West,
through abundance of floating Pieces of Timber, which oftentimes gave
him great stops. The fourth of _July_ he made _Friezland_, where he met
with a great Storm of Hail, mix’d with Snow: Before the Shore lay a
great Ridge of Ice, which hindred for a while their Landing: Here he saw
several Wild People, but could not come to speak with them; for upon the
least approach they fled; yet when they saw any advantage, made
resistance: At last, three of them came unarm’d to the Shore, beckoning
_Forbisher_ to come to them; which he had done, had not great numbers of
the Natives appear’d too soon from an Ambuscade in a Wood, and behind a
Hill, who seeing themselves discover’d, march’d up into the Countrey,
three onely staying on the Shore, of whom the middlemost feigning to be
lame, at last fell down, whom his Companions took up, and carried a
little way, but then forsook, by which the _English_ observing their
Design, shot that the Sand flew all about him; whereupon forgetting his
Lameness, he ran as swift as a Deer up a Hill.

_Forbisher_’s Men had by this time fill’d two Barrels with a Mineral not
unlike Gold, but was afterwards found to be of little value. Nothing
else of Remark did he find here, except great long-hair’d Men, who being
exceeding salvage, subtilly plot nothing else but to murder, lurking for
Men, like Wild Beasts for their Prey, whom, when caught, they tear in
pieces. Close fitted to their Bodies, they wore the Skins of several
Wild Beasts, priding in the Tails which hung down betwixt their Legs.
Their Tents are of conjoyn’d Whalebones, cover’d over with the like
Skins, the Entrance always facing the South. They use Bowes, Arrows,
Slings, and two sorts of Boats: In the biggest they can carry seventeen
Men, which are made of several Wooden Planks clinch’d together, and
cased on both sides with Leather: The smallest ones are cover’d just in
the same manner, much resembling a Weavers Shuttle, having in the middle
a Hole, wherein a Man sits, who drawing the Cover of the Boat about his
Waste by Strings, with one Oar makes swift Passage.

The Countrey it self is barren, yet feeds abundance of Deer, Hares,
Wolves, Bears, and Dogs like Wolves, whose Flesh serves the Inhabitants
for Food.

This Countrey seems to be exceedingly troubled with great Earthquakes,
because several pieces of Rocks, and whole Mountains rent asunder, may
be seen in divers places.

The fourth of _August_, _Forbisher_ having elevated the Pole to sixty
eight Degrees, beyond what _Sebastian Cabot_, the first Discoverer of
those Parts, and set out by _Henry_ the Seventh, had done (for _America_
Northward never before had been so far penetrated) and laden with a sort
of shining Sand, which he believ’d might contain much of a Golden Oar,
having with him three of the Natives, _viz._ a Man, a Woman, and a
Child, set Sail for _England_, and the seventh of _September_ came to
_Milford_-Haven, and not long after arriv’d in _London_, where in short
time the Salvages died.

[Illustration]

[Sidenote: Sir _Francis Drake_’s Expedition.]

At the same time when _Forbisher_ sail’d Northerly, Sir _Francis Drake_
also, fitted out by Queen _Elizabeth_, steer’d another Course, sailing
by _Cape Blanko_ and _Cape Verde_, along the _African_ Coast, to
_Brasile_, where he caught several Sea-Wolves, and Anchoring in the
River _La Plata_, furnish’d himself with Fresh Water: Then proceeding on
his Voyage through the crooked _Straights of Magellan_, he came to an
Anchor before _Moucha_, wash’d by the _South Sea_. The Islanders
receiv’d him very courteously, because they were inform’d that the
_English_ were at great Wars with the _Spaniards_, to avoid whose
Cruelties, they had deserted the main Continent, and setled on _Moucha_.
One of these _Mouchaners_ going aboard, serv’d them for a Pilot to the
Haven _Valparizo_, where _Drake_ burnt the _St. Jago_, a small Village,
and plundring all the Countrey about it, got together a great Treasure
of Gold and Silver. Before _Arica_ he took three _Spanish_ Ships, richly
laden; and before _Lima_, four more, having an unvaluable Treasure of
Pearls and Gold aboard them. Thus inrich’d, he steer’d his Course
Northerly to forty two Degrees; but the Cold forcing him to fall four
Degrees to the Southward, he discover’d a very pleasant and inhabited
Coast, the People whereof shew’d him great kindness: The King himself
coming aboard with a great Train, set a Crown of Gold upon _Drakes_
Head, and gave him a Golden Scepter, and an Ivory Chain. After this he
inspected the Islands _Tidor_, _Ternata_, _Java_, _Zeilon_, and _Cape de
Bona Esperanza_, from whence, after a three Years Voyage, having
encompass’d the World, he came safe to _London_, where he rested not
long; for sailing _Anno 1585._ to _America_, he took great Prizes from
the Cities _St. Jago_, _St. Domingo_, _St. Augustin_, and _Carthagena_,
setting them all on Fire. Thus again returning home victoriously, and
after the famous defeat of the _Spanish Armado_, he rigg’d out a new
Fleet, having for his Vice-Admiral Captain _Hawkins_: Their Design was
to have sail’d to _Panama_; but both dying, and so the Commission
ceasing, the expected great and golden Project also died with them.

[Sidenote: _Candish_ his Expedition.]

A Year after the death of these famous Navigators, Captain _Thomas
Candish_ Mann’d with a hundred and twenty Men, and Provisions for two
Years, setting sail in a lucky Hour, a second time encompass’d the
World, passing the _Straights of Magellan_; in which Voyage having got
above ten times the value of his Charge, by taking the _Spanish_ Carrack
_St. Anna_, valued at twenty Tun of Gold; and at last freighted with a
Mass of Treasure, he came safe into the River of _Thames_.

[Sidenote: _Smith_’s Voyage.]

But much worse success had Captain _John Smith_, who weigh’d Anchor
_Anno 1614._ with two Ships, fitted out by several Merchants in
_London_, for _New-England_, and on the Island _Monachigga_ to load
Copper, Gold, and other Minerals that were to be had there, and also to
fish for Whales: But there were no such Minerals to be found there, nor
any Whales to be taken on the Coast, because the time of the Year was
past; so that he return’d home without Success. However, not long after,
they undertook the same Expedition a second time, but with worse
Fortune; for being gotten in sight of _Virginia_, he was treacherously
set upon, and taken by the _French_, who accus’d him, that he had
destroy’d the Plantations in _Nova Francia_, and unless he would make
satisfaction for the Damage, they threatned him with death. He was
carried Prisoner to _Rochel_, in a _French_ Ship; but not far from
thence surpris’d by a mighty Storm, _Smith_ finding an opportunity,
leap’d into the Boat, and driving betwixt the Waves, at last, half dead,
was thrown upon the Island of _Oleron_, whom afterwards, having lost
all, an _English_ Ship took in, and brought to his Native Countrey.


                               SECT. XV.
     Netherland _Expedition by_ Jaques Mahu, _and_ Simon de Cordes.

[Sidenote: _Mahu_’s Voyage.]

Five Ships being fitted out at _Rotterdam_, the Command of them was
given to _Jaques Mahu_ and _Simon de Cordes_, who on the twenty seventh
of _June, Anno 1598._ weigh’d Anchor from the _Goree_, and sail’d on an
immense Voyage; at last landing at the Island _St. Jago_, they won a
strong Castle there, and took two Barques; but at last Articled with the
_Portuguese_, that they might undisturb’d supply themselves with Fresh
Water, yet they, as if they minded no Agreements, whilst the _Dutch_
were filling their Casks, came down upon them with two hundred Horse,
each having a Foot-Soldier behind him; but the _Hollanders_ made so
stout resistance, that they put them all to flight.

The City of _St. Jago_, which gives Denomination to the whole Island, is
built long-wise, having a convenient Haven, like a Crescent: Through the
City glides a River, on both sides of which, beyond the Town, arise
several high Mountains: That part which faces the Sea, hath
Fortifications, defended with strong Bulwarks. The _Portuguese_ had
brought all their Guns to bear towards the Sea, to sink the _Holland
Ships_, which they invited thither under pretence of kindness; but a
great Storm hindred the Fleet, that they could not Anchor at the
appointed place; onely two of the Ships sail’d pretty near, but not
within Shot.

[Illustration: St. IAGO]

From hence steering to the Desolate Island _Brava_, they saw nothing but
five ruin’d Houses, the Door of one stopp’d up with great Stones, which
being taken away, was found full of _Turkish_ Wheat, which prov’d a
great kindness to the Sea-men.

[Sidenote: _Mahu_ dies.]

[Sidenote: _Cordes_ his Voyage.]

Mean while the Admiral _Mahu_ died, and his Body put into a Chest fill’d
up with Stones, was thrown over-board; so that _Simon des Cordes_
carrying the Flag, steer’d his Course to _Guinee_, there to refresh
himself; for most of his Men were so weakned by the Scurvey, that they
were scarce able to hand the Sails.

[Sidenote: Strange King in _Guinee_.]

Arriving at their intended Port, the Sick were carried ashore; and the
Vice-Admiral _Beuningen_, being conducted by a _French_ Guide, went to
the Vice-Roy of that Countrey, who sat on a low Bench, with a
Sheeps-skin under his Feet, in a Violet-colour’d Cloth Suit, without any
Linnen, Shirt, Shoes, or Stockins; on his Head a Cap made of yellow,
red, and blue Eastern Cloth; his Face whitened with Ashes, shew’d in
several places its natural blackness, appearing through the Colours;
about his Neck a Collar or Chain of Glass Beads: Behind him sat his
Nobles, with Cocks Feathers on their Heads, and their Skins painted Red.

_Beuningen_ plac’d by the King on a Mat, complain’d to him, That the
_Guineans_ fled from him where-ever he came, though in Friendship, to
barter _European_ Commodities with them, against Fruits, Poultrey,
Sheep, and other Provisions: Whereupon the King promis’d to furnish him
therewith, and invited _Beuningen_ to Dinner. After some stay, the Kings
Wives entred the Palace, a very mean and ill-favour’d Building, more
like a great Barn than a Kings House, and plac’d a kind of nasty Trough
on the Ground, in which lay nothing but some wild Herbs, and a piece of
a smoak’d Sea-Calf; and though he was a Person of the largest size, and
corpulent, yet he eat sparingly. _Beuningen_, though exceeding hungry,
found little rellish in such kind of Meats; wherefore spreading a
Napkin, his Attendants brought him some Bisket and _Spanish_ Wine,
whereof after the King had tasted, he lik’d so well the rellish, that it
rock’d him asleep, whilst _Beuningen_ walk’d to the Sea-side to refresh
himself; but the _Guineans_ coming about him, he was forc’d to return to
the King, who waking at the noise, appear’d highly incens’d at his
People, and took _Beuningen_ into his House: However the Subjects,
notwithstanding the Kings Commands, when _Beuningen_ was sent into a
neighboring Hut, kept Watch about it all Night: The next Morning early
an old Woman entred, muttering to her self, and went out and in to
_Beuningen_ three times one after another, knocking on a Box not unlike
a Pair of Bellows, out of which flew abundance of Dust about
_Beuningen_, which caus’d a great Laughter amongst the _Guineans_. The
King also coming to him, presented him with two Goats, and four Hens,
and so conducted him back to the Ships.

[Sidenote: Bloody Sea, very strange.]

[Sidenote: Salvages in the _Straights of Magellan_.]

_Beuningen_ seeing that there was no good to be done, set sail from
thence, and coming before the River _La Plata_ in _America_, it appear’d
Blood-red. Out of the Water which was taken up in Buckets, started a
sort of Insects like Fleas, which caus’d a strange and sad Distemper
amongst the Sea-men, that when any Meat was offer’d to them, so soon as
ever they put it to their Mouths, they would fall down backwards in a
swoon, foaming and frothing at the Mouth, and turning up the White of
their Eyes, die distracted. Suffering under this Disaster, they hasted
from thence with all speed, and sailing into the _Straights of Magellan_
they kill’d above fourteen hundred _Penguyins_, which is a Bird that
preys on Fish, and lives in Holes under Ground; they somewhat resemble a
Goose, onely they stand more upright, and are double-crested, with two
plumy Combs. Coming to an Anchor in the _Green-Bay_, there arose a great
Storm, which continued several days, so that they were forc’d to moor
their Vessels with four Anchors, extremely afflicted both with Hunger
and Cold, preserving themselves alive by eating young Grout, at that
time not above a span high from the Ground; but this course Food bred an
incurable Dropsie, that posted them on to a sudden death. Afterwards,
when the Weather grew more pleasant, the Inhabitants being Gyants, most
of them eleven Foot high, grew more troublesom, oftentimes assailing
them, and throwing Darts pointed like Harping-Irons, at which they were
very expert. Their Salvage Natures may appear by their Dealings with the
dead _Hollanders_, cutting off their Heads, and bruising them to pieces,
sticking Darts through their Hearts, and cutting off their Privities.

[Sidenote: A wild Woman.]

At last the Fleet getting into the _South Sea_, were by stress of
Weather separated one from another: Two Ships, being the _Faith_, and
the _Good Tydings_, were driven back into the _Straights of Magellan_,
where they suffer’d the uttermost extremity of Hunger: Here they took a
wild Woman, and two Children, who being of a sallow Complexion, had a
great hanging Belly, a wide Mouth, crooked Legs, long Heels, and Breasts
like Cows Udders; about her Neck a String of Snail-shells, and upon her
Back a Beasts Skin, fastned about her Neck with the Sinews of it; her
Food nought else but live Fowls: The same Diet the Children fed upon:
The youngest being but six Months old, had his Mouth full of Teeth, and
ran without any help: The eldest they carried to _Amsterdam_; but having
kept the Woman aboard two Nights, they gave her several Trifles, and set
her ashore. Here they found old Ice in the middle of Summer, four Foot
thick.

_Beuningen_ lingred in the _Straights of Magellan_, and being tired out
with Hunger, Cold, and Storms, return’d home; and had they not by
accident taken abundance of Coneys, they had all perish’d. Above two
Years had this unhappy Voyage lasted, when they arriv’d at their Native
Countrey, with six and thirty Men, being all that remain’d alive of a
hundred and five.


                               SECT. XVI.
                 _The Expedition of_ Oliver van Noord.

[Sidenote: _Porto Desire._]

[Sidenote: Sea-Dogs.]

Two Months after _Mahu_, _Oliver Van Noord_ set sail with four Ships,
and two hundred forty eight Men, from the _Maes_. Having reach’d the
_Princes Island_, he lost seven of his Men by the Treachery of the
_Portuguese_; and Anchoring before the City _Javeiro_, he was no better
entertain’d by the same Nation: Here having a Rencounter, and both Sides
receiving considerable Loss, he steer’d for St. _Sebastian_, a fruitful
Island, producing an Herb very wholesom against the _Scurvey_: Here the
Sea-men found great store of Sea-Mews, and Parrots, besides several
sorts of delicious Fish. The approaching Winter advis’d them from
entring the _Straights of Magellan_ so late; wherefore they judg’d it
best to seek a convenient Harbor, to put their Sick ashore to refresh
themselves. The Island _St. Hellen_, for its fruitfulness, seem’d to be
the most convenient for this purpose; but a great Storm preventing them,
they came to _St. Clara_, where taking in Fresh Water, they cast Anchor
in _Porto Desire_. In this Haven they saw a kind of Sea-Dogs, whose
fore-parts being overgrown with long Hair, seem’d like a Lyon, and the
Feet like Mens Hands; over their Eyes and Upper-lips grew black and
white Hair, which in Stormy Weather stands staring upright, but in Calm,
lies flat and smooth; they Urine backwards, sleep very soundly, and cast
their Young every Month: Their Flesh well-boyl’d prov’d a savory Dish.

[Sidenote: Strange Tombs.]

_Van Noord_ going ashore here, saw not a Man; but only Burying-places on
high Rocks, built of red Stones, and adorn’d both within and without
with Bowes, Arrows, and other strange things: Under the Heads of the
Dead lay four-square Shells, and other things artificially carv’d.
Curiosity made them desirous to make a further search into the Countrey;
wherefore he rowed during a whole Tide up a River; and when their Boat
ran aground at the time of Ebb, he walk’d several Leagues up into the
Countrey, where he saw nothing but Deer, Buffles, and Ostriches: and
because he saw no People, he judg’d the Coast to be uninhabited; but
returning again, he found it otherwise; for the Sea-men, though
commanded to stay in the Boat, which lay in the middle of the River,
went ashore, where they were so fiercely set upon by thirty of the
Natives, that three of them were kill’d, and another wounded in the Leg.
These People are very strong and Salvage, with painted Faces, and long
Hair; but after this Encounter, they saw no more of them.

But _Van Noord_ having spent fourteen Months in search, and lost a
hundred Men, set sail again with three Ships; for one of them, being the
_Unity_, he burnt at the Island _Clara_, where he Winter’d, because of a
great Leak which could not be stopp’d. Here they brought five thousand
Fowls aboard, which much increased their Stock of Provisions.

From hence parting the Wide Ocean, into the _Straights of Magellan_,
four times the Fleet attempted to go into the _South-Sea_, and was as
often driven back by cross Weather into the _Straights_; but the fifth
time prov’d more successful; for having got through, and left the
_Straights_ a handsom way astern, they discover’d two Islands, from one
of which the Sea-men going aland, brought four Boys and two Girls; who
afterward instructed in their Tongue, inform’d them concerning the
scituation of the Countreys thereabout.

[Sidenote: _Philip-Stadt_ forsaken through famine.]

After that, the Fleet Sail’d into _Hungers Haven_, where they found the
ruines of the deserted _Philip-Stadt_, which Captain _Thomas Candish_
had seen fourteen years before, fortifi’d with four Bulwarks; but now
onely some Houses, a Church, and a Gibbet were standing: Four hundred
_Spaniards_ built that City, as a Key to the _Straights_ of _Magellan_.
But all their Provisions being spent in three years time, and no relief
coming from _Spain_, and what they Sow’d expecting the hopes of a
Harvest, the Salvages coming down by night destroy’d; which caus’d so
great a Famine to rage amongst them, that many dy’d, not so much as
putting off their Clothes, who lying in the Houses unbury’d, occasion’d
such a stench in the City, that the remainder fled into the Field; where
they liv’d a whole year by the Fruits of the Trees, Herbs, and Roots: At
last, three and twenty of them, amongst which were two Women remaining
yet alive, resolv’d to travel to the River _La Plata_ and accordingly
set forward, but what became of them could never yet be heard, only one
_Ferdinando_ that was of that company, accidentally wandring from the
rest, happen’d to light upon _Candish_’s Fleet.

[Sidenote: _Mocha_, what kind of Island.]

Here _Van Noord_ set on Shore the Vice-Admiral _Jacob Claeszoon
Ilpendam_, for some crimes which he had committed; and leaving him
behind, Sail’d from thence thorow the South-Sea along the Coast of
_Chili_ and _Mocha_; which Island, of a considerable bigness, rises in
the middle with a forked Mountain, from which a convenient River comes
flowing down into the Countrey.

[Sidenote: _Cica_, a strange Drink.]

The Inhabitants conducted the _Hollanders_ to their Village, consisting
of about fifty Houses built of Straw, but were forbid to go into their
Huts: Upon the Mens call the Women appear’d, which being divided into
three parties, humbly kneel’d down before them; and soon after an old
Woman brought an Earthen Can full of _Cica_, a Liquor made of _Mays_,
whose extracted Juyce, boyl’d and put into Tubs, ferments like our Beer
or Ale, with a cap of Barm, with which they treated the _Hollanders_,
who drinking moderately, were well refresh’d; but the Natives will ply
this Liquor, till they make themselves Distracted, and are mad Drunk.

[Sidenote: _Van Noord_ takes a _Spanish_ Ship.]

From hence _Van Noord_ steer’d his course to _Sancta Maria_, where in
his way he took a _Spanish_ Ship, call’d _Buon Jesus_, that is, _Good
Jesus_, and receiv’d intelligence from the Prisoners, that the Admiral
_Simon de Cordes_, with twenty three Men was kill’d by the _Americans_
on the Promontory _Lavapia_, being the head Land or Point opposite to
_St. Maries_; that a year since, tydings were brought to _Lima_ of his
Fleet; so that they had made all things ready to withstand him. But _Van
Noord_ hinder’d by strong contrary Winds, not able to reach _Sancta
Maria_, stood directly for _St. Jago_, in whose Haven lay a great
_Spanish_ Ship full of _Indians_, and two other going in, which two he
set on Fire, and the third he Tow’d towards his Fleet; repenting
extremely that he had given liberty, and set _Francisco de Ivarro_
Commander of the _Buon Jesus_ ashore; because he afterwards understood
from the _Spanish_ Pilot, that _Ivarra_ threw ten thousand two hundred
pound weight of Gold, pack’d in fifty two Cases, over-board, when he
observ’d that he was like to loose his Ship.

The Fleet Sailing forward came to an Anchor before the _Thieves-Island_,
whose Inhabitants are very light Finger’d, go stark naked, and are of
great strength; they found the Women much Disfigur’d, their Noses, Lips,
and Cheek-bones eaten by the _French_ Pox.

[Illustration]

[Sidenote: Performs great things.]

In the Bay _La Baya_, the _Dutch_ Admiral, with a _Spanish_ Flag on his
top-Mast, sent one of his Sea-men in a Fryers garb ashore, if possible
under that disguise, to get Provisions; which falling out according to
their Design, they were supply’d with all manner of Victuals: After
that, the _Hollanders_ burnt five Villages on the Island _Capull_; took
a _Chinesy_ Vessel, one _Spanish_ Barque, and a _Carvel_ Laden with
Brandy from _Cocos_; and after a great and bloody Fight sunk the Admiral
of the _Manilla_’s, and so at last with various fortunes arriv’d at
_Rotterdam_, having in three years encompass’d the World.


                              SECT. XVIA.
               _The Expedition_ of George Van Spilbergen.

_Anno 1614._ the eighth of _August_, the _East-India_ Company of the
_United Netherlands_ set out seven Ships under the Command of _George
Spilbergen_, who coming to _Cape St. Vincent_, and engaging with the
_Portuguese_, took one of their Ships, and so proceeded on his Voyage to
the _Straights_ of _Magellan_, but by a huge Storm, the Fleet was
separated. Amongst those that were scatter’d was the good Ship call’d
_Meruw_, in which some of the crew had conspir’d to have kill’d the
Master, and seiz’d the Vessel; but he having some inkling thereof, set
so stoutly upon two of the chief Contrivers with his drawn Hanger, that
he forc’d them to leap over-board, and as stoutly ordering the rest, set
all to rights.

[Sidenote: Strange Corps.]

But _Spilbergen_ Landing on one of the _Penguyn_ Islands, found two Dead
Bodies just cover’d with Earth, about their Necks was a Chain of
glistering Snail Shells neatly strung; the Grave stuck full of Bowes and
Arrows, was pleasant to look upon, between several high Mountains, whose
tops lay bury’d in Snow: The Fleet came out of the _Straights_ of
_Magellan_, but not without great danger, for the South-Sea much
disturb’d by tempestuous Weather, seem’d to raise its Waves up to the
Sky, so that they had enough to do, from being ingag’d among the Rocks:
But at last with great difficulty, wonderfully escaping all danger, they
Anchor’d before _La Mocha_, an Island which on the North side lies low,
and on the South defended by Rocks.

[Sidenote: _Spilbergen_ in great danger.]

[Sidenote: Strange sheep.]

_Spilbergen_ seeing abundance of Men standing on the Shore, Row’d
thither to Barter for Merchandize, amongst them was a Sheep with a long
Neck, bunch-Back’d like a Camel, a little Mouth, and long Legs; which
Beast serves them in stead of Horses, to carry their burthens, and
perform their Tillage. The _Americans_ breed up these Sheep every where,
by reason of the extraordinary benefit they receive from them, some of
them keeping no less than eighteen hundred. Their Shepherds ride upon a
Beast almost like an Ox, and carry in their hands Copper-plates, hung
round about with Bells, which they shake, making a different noise when
their Sheep shall go in or out; and on their Heads wear Feathers like
Coronets, standing upright.

[Sidenote: St. _Maries_ burnt.]

[Sidenote: And also _Val Parysa_.]

From thence, _Spilbergen_ departing, Landed at last on the Island of
_St. Mary_, where he burnt all the _Spanish_ Villages; as he did also in
_Val Parysa_.

After going ashore, in the Haven _Quintero_, he saw abundance of Wild
Horses drinking out of a Rivulet, supply’d with fresh Water from an
adjoyning steep Mountain; so soon as they espy’d Men, they instantly
running away, were seen no more.

[Sidenote: Bloody fight between the _Hollanders_ and _Spanish_ Fleet.]

Having left _Quintero_, and spent a Moneth in Sailing farther, they
discry’d eight great Ships; whereupon the Prisoners inform’d them, that
it was the _Spanish_ Fleet, of which _Roderigo de Mendoza_ was Admiral,
fitted out on purpose to fight _Spilbergen_, whose coming (as we said)
was known a year before. At midnight _Mendoza_ Boarded _Spilbergen_, but
was so roughly receiv’d, that he was forc’d to Retreat with the loss of
the Ship _St. Francisco_. At Day-break, the _Holland_ Admiral fir’d at
_Mendoza_, who answering with equal courage, occasion’d a smart
Engagement, wherein the _Spaniards_ were so hard beset, that they put
forth a White Flag; but it was immediately taken in again by the
Commanders aboard, choosing rather to die, than surrender, because they
had mock’d at _Mendoza_, when he hinted the difficulty of the Enterprize
in the Grand _Peruvian_ Councel, saying, _They went out, onely to take a
few disabled_ Hollanders, _and tying them hand and feet, carry them to
Execution_. Yet their high and proud Stomachs prov’d very fatal to them,
for afterwards totally routed and put to flight, most of them sunk by
the way.

[Sidenote: _Calyow de Lima._]

This done, the _Hollanders_ victoriously Sail’d to _Calyow de Lima_,
having a convenient Haven: The City adorn’d with curious Houses and
Temples, is strengthen’d by a Platform, Planted with great Guns towards
the Sea, and the Shore was guarded by eight Troops of Horse, and four
thousand Foot; whereupon _Spilbergen_, who was yet to go so great a
Voyage, judg’d it no way convenient to adventure the loss of all on the
good or bad event of a Battel, especially being so much over-power’d by
the number of the Enemy: Wherefore seeing no hopes of Victory, setting
forward to _Guarma_, he got some fresh Provisions.

[Sidenote: _Peyta_ burnt.]

Against the City _Peyta_, he play’d his Cannon with such fury, that the
Townsmen deserted the place, which he observing, set it on fire, and
Sail’d to _Aquapulque_, where from the Fort at first the _Spaniards_
fired some Guns at them; but soon after changing humor, they came to an
Accommodation, furnishing the _Hollanders_ with convenient Provisions.
Passing on, and coming to _Selaques_, both Natives and _Spaniards_
having suffer’d some of the _Hollanders_ to Land; after set upon them
treacherously in a Thicket, but to their little advantage, for they made
so good a Defence, that the Assailants not able to bear the brunt, fled
with great loss.

_Spilbergen_ Sailing from hence to the _Manilla_’s, waited there for the
_Spanish_ Admiral _Juan de Silva_, who had made (as was reported) great
preparations for him long since; but seeing it was in vain, at last he
return’d to _Zealand_ where he came to an Anchor, loaden with Riches, in
the middle of Summer, _Anno 1617._


                              SECT. XVII.
_The Expedition of_ William Corneliszon Schouten, _and_ Jacob Le Maire.

[Sidenote: _Mabrabomma_, what manner of Isle.]

[Sidenote: _Schouten_ in great danger.]

[Sidenote: Incredible many Eggs.]

[Sidenote: Great Corps.]

[Sidenote: _Ketch_ burnt.]

[Sidenote: Strange Horn.]

Some Merchants that were call’d the _Austrian_ Company, fitted out one
Ship with sixty five, and a Ketch with two and twenty Sea-men, giving
the Command thereof to the Captains _Schouten_ and _Le Maire_: _Anno
1615._ they Weigh’d Anchor from the _Texel_; the first took a view of
one of the three Islands, call’d _Mabrabomma_, lying before _Cape Sierra
Leona_. This Island appearing a great height out of the Sea, was not
inhabited, they seeing onely three Wild Buffles, many Wild Cats, Birds
which bark’d like Dogs, Wild Palm-Trees, Lemon-Trees, Turtles,
Crocodiles, Partridges, and Storks: From hence, passing by the dangerous
Shelf _Abrolhos_, they ran into _Porto Desire_, where on the Rocks they
found abundance of Eggs, and Spierings, or Smelts, and Spiregrass
sixteen Inches long, wherefore they call’d that Inlet _Spierings-Bay_.
Their Sloop also brought two Sea-Lions, and one hundred and fifty
_Penguins_ from the _Penguin_ Isles, having Sail’d two Leagues up the
River; in the interim, the ground being meer Stone, and their Anchors
coming home, the great Ship drove against a Rock, and at Ebbing Water,
broke off the outermost Planks and Iron-Work, and the Ketch also
striking on a high Shelf, was at low Ebb two Fathom with her Keel above
the Water, and had without peradventure been overset, and bilg’d, but a
fresh North-West Wind kept her upright, yet at last, the Weather growing
calm, she lean’d, but the Tide coming in very fast, set her afloat, so
that she was miraculously sav’d; then setting Sail again to
_King’s-Island_, they found so many Eggs of black _Mews_, that one
without stirring from his place, might reach above fifty Nests, and in
each of them at least three Eggs, which they carry’d aboard by
thousands. Their Boat Rowing Southerly down the River, found some
Ostriches, and Beasts not unlike Stags, but with exceeding long Necks.
On the Hills lay Stones heap’d one upon another, which removing, they
found Dead Bodies of eleven Foot long; here they spent their time in
cleansing their Ships, and new Sheathing the Ketch, but as they were
Tallowing, the Flame accidentally got between the Crevisses which
immediately taking Fire, in a short time consum’d it to Ashes: The great
Ship had gotten a Horn in her Bow, seven Foot under Water; this Horn
being firm without any hollowness, and not unlike a great Elephants
Tooth, struck thorow two Ashen and one Oaken Plank, sticking in a Rib of
the like Wood, and yet above half a Foot remain’d out to be seen.

[Sidenote: Great Mews.]

At length _Schouten_ Weighing Anchor from _Porto Desire_, and Sailing to
four and fifty Degrees Southern Latitude, met whole Shoals of Whales,
insomuch, that he was fain to Tacque to and again to shun them.
Sea-Pies, bigger than Swans, came flying in great numbers aboard,
suffering themselves to be taken with the hand. On the North-side they
spy’d a high and scraggy Coast spreading it self to the East South-East,
which they call’d, The _States Countrey_, that which lay to the Westward
of it, _Maurice_ of _Nassau_, the Islands in fifty seven Degrees
_Barnevield_’s Isles, and the sharp Point in which lay the Snowy
Mountains, Southward of the _Magellan Straights_ end, the _Cape_ of
_Hoorn_.

[Sidenote: _Straights Le Maire._]

_Schouten_ had now gotten the height of fifty nine Degrees, when he
enter’d the South-Sea, through the new passage between _Mauritius_ and
the _States-Countrey_, which was call’d from his Partner, _The Straights
of Le Maire_.

[Sidenote: Isles in the South-Sea.]

Near the two Isles _Juan Fernando_, they found great store of Fish,
after that they view’d these Islands, that lay scatter’d up and down the
South-Sea, each of them they nam’d according to their several occasions,
calling the first, _The Isle of Dogs_, because they have abundance of
Dogs there that could not bark: Another, _The Bottomless Island_,
because the Sea was so deep about it, that they could not come to an
Anchor. The Inhabitants who go naked, with their Skins pounced full of
strange shapes, of blue Snakes, Dragons, and such like Creatures,
Salli’d out of the Woods upon the _Hollanders_ with great Clubs, to
which was fasten’d the Sword or Snout of a Sword-Fish, and also with
Slings.

Somewhat further they came to _Water-Land_, and _Flyes-Island_, the
first so nam’d, because the Shore round about was planted with Trees,
but in the middle all lay cover’d with Salt-Water; the other from the
_Flyes_, which with incredible numbers troubled the Sea-men four days
together.

[Sidenote: Strange entertainment at the Horn Islands.]

Moreover, the Reception or Entertainment which _Schouten_ was welcom’d
withal, at the _Hoorn-Islands_, being very remarkable, we will in brief
relate:

Anchoring in nine Fathom Water, Shelly ground, before a fresh Rivulet,
three _Hollanders_ sent to the King were by him courteously entertain’d,
who with strange humility, not bow’d, but kissing their Feet fell flat
on the ground, and put the _Hollanders_ Feet upon his Neck; and after
this manner of Salutation, waited upon them aboard: Yet although this
King fawn’d so much, and seem’d so humble, yet he was very severe over
his Subjects, for finding one that had filch’d a Sword, he not onely
brought and restor’d it, but immediately Executed the Thief before their
Faces.

_Le Maire_ and _Arias Claeszoon_ were much honor’d here, for the old and
young King put their Crowns on their Heads, curiously Wrought of fine
White Feathers, and the end adorn’d with small Red and Green Feathers;
they gave also to each of them a Pigeon, White to their Wings, the
hinder part Black, and under their Bellies Red.

In the interim, the King of _Water-Island_ visited the other, by whom
_Le Maire_ was treated: When they met, they made strange shews of Honor
to each other, but at last shew’d their Salvageness by eating raw Fish,
and rudely Dancing before the _Hollanders_. _Le Maire_ going into the
Countrey, and climbing up a high Mountain, saw nothing but Morass Wilds,
and Vallies, lying under Water: The King and his Retinue here kept him
company, during his stay there, when weary with walking, they sate down
together under Coco-Nut-Trees; the young King tying a String about his
Leg, climb’d with exceeding dexterity up a high Tree, bringing several
Coco-Nuts down with him, which he open’d very expeditiously.

_Arias Claeszoon_, Rowing ashore one night, found the King sitting under
a Roof, resting on four Pillars, where several Naked Women Danc’d before
him according to their Musick, which was Taboring upon a hollow Piece of
Wood, which yielded a murmuring sound without any distinct Tune.

[Illustration]

[Sidenote: _Cava_ a strange Liquor.]

[Sidenote: Impudent Women.]

But the two Kings meeting again, the next day Complemented one another
with more antick and ridiculous Postures, sitting side by side under the
Roof, imploring their God, with their Hands folded, and their Heads
bow’d to the ground: At this interview, four _Holland_ Trumpeters and
Drummers stood playing before the King, to the great admiration and
amazement of the Islanders, which were near ten thousand gather’d
together upon the News of the strangers to attend the two Kings. Soon
after a great company of Rusticks came running thither, which had a
green Herb call’d _Cava_, ty’d about their middle; on a sudden they
began all to chaw this _Cava_, throwing that which they had chaw’d into
a large Woodden Trough, then putting Water to it, they Kneaded it
together; which done, brought the Liquor on their Heads to the two
Kings, before whom they kneel’d when they gave them any: Yet
notwithstanding they receiv’d such honor from their Subjects, they
shew’d servile respects to the _Hollanders_, for every King presented
them with a Pig, which they first laid on their Heads, then kneeling,
put it down at _Le Maire_’s Feet, and bowing their Heads to the ground,
rose again. They wear their Hair long, which Brayded, hung on the left
side of their Heads down to their Hips, ty’d at the end with two Knots;
but the Nobility had two such Locks: All of them went naked, their
Privities onely cover’d. The smallest of the Men exceeded the biggest of
the _Hollanders_ in tallness. The Women had long Breasts hanging like
Satchels down to their Bellies, and so unshamefac’d, that they
prostituted themselves to any, in sight of all Men; and still at low
Water, their business was to catch Fish, which they greedily eat raw.

[Sidenote: Strange wild men.]

[Sidenote: Deform’d people.]

After all this Entertainment, Weighing from hence, _Schouten_ Sail’d
along the Coast of _New-Guiny_, where three Boats full of _Negro_’s came
Rowing towards them, Slinging very fiercely Stones at them, and hovering
about, attended their motion all night. Next morning, seven Boats more
coming to their assistance, they set upon the _Hollanders_, but soon
fled from their Bullets; yet two of the _Negro_’s were taken, that in
each Nostril wore a Ring. Sailing further, several Boats came aboard of
them, whereof those that Row’d, breaking their _Assagays_ or Launces
over their Heads, enter’d the Ship; the Hair of their Heads and Beards
bedawb’d with Lime, flew about, whilst they Danc’d on the Decks, after
they had eaten a good Meal: But they endeavor’d to reward this their
kind Entertainment with Treachery, for going ashore, they soon after
return’d in greater numbers, and sat upon the Anchors which lay over the
Bows of the Ship, and there being a great calm, endeavor’d to Towe the
Ship towards the Shore, whilst others threw Stones and Arrows. But so
soon as the _Hollanders_ firing their Guns Wounded several of them, they
all fled, except some which they took Prisoners, whereof one whom they
afterwards call’d _Moses_, did them great service.

But _Le Maire_ was amaz’d at nothing more, than when on the next Coast
he saw several little Houses built about nine Foot high, out of which
many People issu’d, which were all deform’d, either having Wry Noses,
Bow Legs, Squint Eyes, or crooked Backs, and all in one part or another
mis-shapen.

At last, Anchoring before _Jacatra_, the Ship was stopt there by order
of the _East-India_ Company, and the Men divided and put aboard those
Ships that Sail’d from _India_ to _Holland_, and arriv’d in safety at
_Flushing_, after they had Sail’d about the World, in two years and
eighteen days.


                              SECT. XVIII.
     _Voyage of the_ Nassavian _Fleet, under the Command of_ Jaques
                L’Heremite, _and_ Geen Huigo Schapenham.

[Sidenote: Remarkable Exploits of _L’Hermite_.]

The _United Netherlands_, to abate the _Spanish_ Greatness, set out a
considerable Fleet, which they sent to try their fortune, in making
Prize of what ever they could light upon in any of their Havens wash’d
by the South-Sea.

_Jaques L’Hermite_ had ten Ships under his Command, Mann’d with sixteen
hundred thirty seven Men, and two hundred ninety four Brass and Iron
Guns, with which he set Sail from _Goree_, _Anno 1623._ and coming
before _Cape Vincent_, he discover’d eleven _Turkish_ Pirates, whom
fighting, he beat, and re-took the _Holland_ Ships they had made Prize
of.

At _Roxents Head_, _L’Hermite_ gave chase to fifteen _Spanish_ Ships,
and coming up with them, sunk eleven, and took four laden with Sugar.
Afterwards Anchoring at _Safia_, he sent the Ship _Over-yssel_, and a
Frigat call’d the _Gray-Hound_, to Convoy home the Prizes; afterward
being inform’d, that thirty _Spanish_ Ships were making to them, Sailing
into the Haven _St. Vincent_, the Spring Water that he supply’d his
empty Cask with being brakkish, caus’d an excoriation of the Guts, which
brought the Bloody-Flux, whereby he lost many of his Sea-men; being well
entertain’d by the Salvages of _Antonio_, they went on to _Sierra
Leona_, a Mountainous Point full of Lime-Trees, here they found the
Names of _Sr. Francis Drake_, and other _English_ cut in a Rock.

After that he put in at the fruitful Island _Annabon_, where he caus’d
his Chirurgeon to be Beheaded.

[Sidenote: _Vegar_ a wicked man.]

This wicked Man being brought to the Torture, would confess nothing
concerning the Crimes objected against him, but being strip’d for
Execution, they found a small Bag hanging on his Breast, in which lay a
Serpents Skin and Tongue, with which he had Poyson’d several Men, but he
confess’d nothing.

The first of _February_, the Fleet came to _Cape de Pemias_, which they
know at a great distance, by its high Mountains cover’d with Snow.

In short time after, Sailing by the Mouth of the _Straights_ of _La
Maire_, they met with very tempestuous Weather, and seventeen of their
Men going ashore, were devour’d by the _Cannibals_ of _Terra del Fuogo_.
These People being all _Whites_, and of a large Stature, Paint
themselves Red, and go stark naked, except some of highest quality who
tie a Deer Skin about their Necks; and the Women cover their Nakedness
with a piece of Leather: They live in Bowers made of the Branches of
Trees, Stak’d three Foot deep, in a round at bottom, and above like our
Tents, Canopy’d, the top of which open, to carry out the Smoke like a
Chimney; and have no other Houshold-stuff than some Baskets, in which
they lay their few Fishing Implements. They go continually Arm’d with
Clubs, Arrows, Slings, and Stone-Knives: Their Boats being only the
Trunk of a Tree made hollow, rise up before and behind like a Half-Moon,
and are fourteen, and some sixteen Foot long, and two broad, and Row
swifter than a Pinnace with many Oars. Lastly, they are so Salvage, that
they seem rather to be Beasts than Men, knowing no Religion, ill
Natur’d, cruel and Treacherous.

From hence, passing on, _L’Hermite_ refresh’d at the desolate Isle
_Fernando_, and so Steer’d his Course to _Calla de Lima_, on whose
Coast, taking a _Spanish_ Vessel, the Prisoners told him, that their
Plate-Fleet had Weigh’d Anchor, and were gone to _Panama_; only the
Admiral which carry’d forty Brass Guns, with fifty Merchant-Men, lay
close under the Shore, Guarded by three Stone Bulwarks, Fortifi’d with
fifty Guns.

_L’Hermite_ having a design upon these, took three _Spanish_ Vessels
that were going thither, and at midnight, sent Captain _Adrian Tol_,
_Peter Slobbe_, and _Meindert Egbertszon_, with twelve well Mann’d
Boats, furnish’d with Brass Drakes, and Hand-Granado’s, to Attaque the
_Spanish_ Fleet that lay hard by; and whilst some gave a false Alarm on
the North of _Callao_, the Boats Rowing from Ship to Ship, in short time
fir’d forty of them; although the _Spaniards_ from the Shore endeavor’d
by their Shot to drive back the Enemy, neither the Fort or Admiral
sparing Powder nor Ball.

In this valiant Exploit the _Hollanders_ had onely seven Men kill’d, and
fifteen Wounded: About break of day, seven of the _Spanish_ Ships
floated, burning towards the _Dutch_ Fleet, which were as terrible as
now Fire-ships, which forc’d them to Weigh Anchor to shun them.

After that, _L’Hermite_ took two Ships laden with Wine, a third full of
Wood, and a fourth with Wheat: One of these Prizes he fitted and
prepar’d for a Fire-ship, and sending her to Board the _Spanish_
Admiral, it ran aground within shot of him; whereupon being batter’d by
the Admirals Guns, and those from the Bulwarks, and at last taking Fire
gave but a small blow, because most part of the Powder had taken Wet.

In this interim, while thus their design went prosperously on, their
Admiral _L’Heremite_ dy’d, whom they Bury’d on the Island _Lima_, and
_Schapenham_, in defiance of the Vice-Roy in _Callao_, caus’d one and
twenty _Spaniards_ to be hang’d at the Yard-Arm, because he had sent him
a scornful Answer on the Proposals concerning the delivery of the
Prisoners.

[Sidenote: _Vershoor_’s Exploit.]

[Sidenote: _Schapenham_’s remarkable Exploits.]

[Sidenote: _Schapenham_ dies.]

_Cornelius Jacobszoon_ Sailing to _Pisco_ with four Sail from the Fleet,
could do no good there, for he not onely found the City to be surrounded
with a Wall of fifteen Foot high, but having also many Earthen Redoubts,
behind which lay above two thousand arm’d Men, wherefore he deserted the
same after some Rancounters: But the Rear-Admiral, _John Williamszoon
Vershoor_, who was sent to _Gainquil_, had much better luck; for he not
onely took that Metropolis, but also burnt a new Royal _Gallion_, and
two lesser Vessels; carry’d a conquer’d Vessel to _Lima_; slew above a
hundred _Spaniards_, and threw seventeen overboard, because they had
shot Poyson’d Bullets against the Law of Arms; of which Conquest Captain
_Engelbert Shutte_ had the greatest honor: But the Sea-men grew weaker
and weaker by the Scurvy, and all of them would have perish’d, had they
not found a soveraign Herb on the highest Mountains of _Lima_.
_Schapenham_ being chose Admiral in _L’Heremites_ place, Weigh’d Anchor
from _Callao_, and ran into the Inlet _Piscadores_, where on the shore
he rais’d a Sconce; yet not long after departed from thence without any
effect, but lost twenty eight Men, through the bad Conduct of their
Commanders; the like number he lost also at _Aquapulque_, on the side of
which City stands a Castle with four strong Bulwarks; the _Holland_
Fire-ship lay just without the reach of the shot, the rest lay along the
shore in a row, there to seize upon the Vessels expected thither from
the _Manillaes_: But because the Scurvy raged amongst the Sea-men, and
disabled them, they waited in vain, _Schapenham_ Sail’d through the
South-Sea to the _Ladrones_, where he found store of Provisions. _Anno
1625._ in _March_, he drop’d Anchor before _Maleye_, and from thence
went with _Herman Spiult_, the Governor for the _East-India_ Company in
_Amboina_, to _Ceram_, where they Conquer’d the Fort _Lochoe_, and soon
after _Cambella_; then the Fleet being divided, _Schapenham_ carry’d
home two Ships from _Batavia_, and the remainder return’d at several
times, they being hir’d to serve the _East-India_ Company to _Surratta_,
_Malacca_, _Coromandel_, and the _Molucco Isles_: _Schapenham_ Deceasing
near _Bantum_, and being Bury’d on _Pulo Boftok_, the Ships arriv’d at
the _Texel_ in _July, Anno 1626._


                       Henry Brewer _his Voyage_.

_Anno 1643._ _Brewer_ set Sail with four Ships from _Reciffo_, and ran
close along the _States-Isle_, so dangerous and Rocky, that he durst not
put in to the Land; from which flew great abundance of Party-colour’d
Ducks, with sharp Bills, about the Ships, and under the Keels swam also
Whales.

[Sidenote: Sea Lions.]

[Sidenote: _Brewer_’s Haven.]

[Sidenote: Remarkable Exploits.]

On the West side of the _Straights Le Maire_, _Brown_ ran into
_Valentine_’s Inlet, where he was much troubled by the Winds which came
whistling through the hollow Mountains with great and sudden gusts: The
shore afforded red and black Strawberries, _Carville_ and Muscles, to
the great refreshment of the Sea-men, who daily saw Sea-Lions, but could
not come to shoot one of them, for no sooner they perceiv’d any body,
but they Diving under Water, swam away; and though they saw Mens
Foot-steps of eighteen Inches long, yet they never found any Men. Thence
Sailing into the South-Sea, along the Coast of _Chili_, they enter’d a
Bay which they nam’d _Brewer’s-Haven_; where Landing, they walk’d
towards a great Smoke which they saw afar off, but coming near it, found
only two Houses within a large Plain, full of Sheep, Oxen, and Horses;
before the Houses stood Woodden Crosses.

[Sidenote: _Ter Bergen_’s Exploit.]

[Sidenote: _Castro_ a City.]

[Sidenote: Stream _Chili_.]

[Sidenote: _Brewer_ Dies.]

[Sidenote: Strange accident.]

[Sidenote: _Baldivia_, a brave City.]

The _Dolphin_ Pink and a great Boat being sent to the Inlet, lay the
following Night at an Anchor near a high Mountain; from whence, in the
Night, two great Guns were fir’d, whereupon, Lieutenant _William Ter
Bergen_ Landed with sixteen Musqueteers, and climbing up the Mountain,
found a Village behind the same, where all things were in Alarm, Drums
beating, Trumpets sounding, Bells ringing; the Villagers suddenly firing
their Guns on _Ter Bergen_, who being supply’d with thirty four Men,
Encounter’d the Enemy so Valiantly, that he fled into the Woods, not
without the loss of Men and Horses: The Guns with which they had shot in
the Night lay onely on a Redoubt: _Ter Bergen_ persuing this Victory,
March’d into the Woods, and shot the _Spanish_ Commander _Andreas Munes
Iserrera_ from his Horse, got great store of Treasure which lay hid
under the Tree, being brought out of _Carelmappa_, which Village he set
afire, and kill’d all the Horses, and Weigh’d Anchor with the Admiral
_Brewer_ to _Michael de Cabuco_ where not being able to Land, because of
the many obscure Rocks and Shoals, they set Sail to _Castro_, which they
conquer’d and burnt without the least resistance: This City situate on a
Mountain is stately built among Flowry Meadows, delightful Orchards, and
brave Fountains; the Sea before it flows daily fourteen Foot. _Brewer_
also burnt a _Spanish_ Ship, and set some Houses afire, took three
_Spaniards_ Prisoners on _Las Bahias_, who inform’d him, that the Winter
Season was almost over, but that it was never known by any to pass over
so mildly, ill Weather generally using to blow down Houses, Trees, and
rend Rocks asunder; that there was much Gold in _Osorno_ and _Baldivia_,
which last they had some years since deserted for hunger, but it was
since Garrison’d by three hundred _Castilians_, that none could get at
the Fort _Conception_ (which lay a League Westerly from thence) but in a
small Boat, that there were on the place near two thousand Inhabitants.
Moreover, an ancient Matron call’d _Lovysa Pizarra_, from _Quintian_,
one of the Isles in the _Chilean_ In-Land-Sea, being fetch’d from
thence, gave information, that forty years since, before the _Indians_
took up Arms, the _Spaniards_ were quietly setled in _Osorno_, and in so
good a condition, that an ordinary Planter had at least three hundred
Slaves, of which, every one was to procure a certain quantity of Gold;
that the Isles _Chiloves_ were divided into above a hundred Colonies or
Plantations, the _Chileses_ serving the _Castilians_ as their true
Governors; those that do good Service the King of the Colony makes them
Commanders, and that the _Chileses_ had Rebell’d in several places.
_Brewer_ on the _Chileses_ request took some of them, with their Wives
and Children into his Ship, furnish’d with Arms, he digg’d a Chest of
Silver and a Brass Gun out of the Earth, and soon after being sick,
dy’d. His Successor _Elias Herkmans_ prosecuting those Publick Affairs,
sent the Pilot of the _Unity_ out of _Brewer’s Haven_, and some Sea-men,
with two _Chilean Casiques_ with a Boat to _Carelmappa_; but being
surpriz’d by a violent Storm, stood in for _Horse-Island_, where he and
the _Casiques_ Landing, he order’d seven Sea-men to carry the Boat to a
safer Harbor; but being driven from the shore by strong Winds it took in
so much Water as fill’d and sunk it, so that all of them were drown’d.
_Horse-Island_ being destitute of Provisions and Lodgings, those that
were Landed expected nothing but Death, till they found out a small Hut,
and in the same six brave Sheep, and a good quantity of Potatoe Roots,
which serv’d for Bread: But when this their new-found Store was almost
spent, they happily were fetch’d off by the Boat belonging to the Ship
_Amsterdam_, and with the whole Fleet came to an Anchor before
_Baldivia_. This City built by the _Castilians_, consisted formerly of
five hundred and fifty fair Houses, and was divided into Streets and
cross Ways, with two large Markets, and as many costly Churches.

[Sidenote: Why the _Chileses_ grew strange to the _Hollanders_.]

The _Chileses_ unsufferably oppress’d, slew all the _Spanish_ Garrison,
and into the Governor’s Mouth and Ears pour’d melted Gold; of his Skull
they made a Drinking-cup, and of his Shin-bones, Trumpets; after this,
the City fell almost to decay, onely a great part of the Wall remain’d
yet standing: The _Chileans_ hereupon flock’d hither by thousands, some
on Horses, others on Foot, all Arm’d with Lances of a Foot long:
_Herkman_ hereupon informing them by an Interpreter, that they being
mortal Enemies of the _Spaniards_, would joyn with the _Chileans_
against that common Foe; and desir’d, that they might build a Fort on
the Market-place in _Baldivia_, for a defence against all Invasions, and
that they might be supply’d with Provisions which the Fleet wanted; all
which the _Chileans_ granted, and accordingly brought in store of Sheep,
Hogs, and Cattel: But so soon as _Herkman_ began to make the least
mention of Gold, they were all abash’d, and said, that they knew of no
Gold Mines, nay, their Hair stood an end, when they heard the name of
Gold; so horribly the _Spaniards_ had dealt with their Parents: After
this, the _Chileans_ growing more and more strange, did not in the least
countenance the building of the Fort, and the longer the Fleet staid,
the less Provisions they brought aboard; upon which, the Ships were
necessitated, without any remarkable Exploits, to set Sail and return to
_Reciffo_.

  _Of the Bounds of_ America, _and of the Division of the_ Mexican _or
                        Northern part thereof_.


[Sidenote: The Bounds and Division of _Northern America_.]

Having in the first part of this Volume discours’d at large concerning
the original of the _Americans_, and whether that part of the World
call’d _India Occidentalis_, or _America_, were known to the Ancients,
or own its Discovery wholly to the Moderns, as also of all the
Discoveries that have been made of the several parts thereof, and by
whom, we shall now pass on to the Topographical part, describing every
particular Province or Region, by giving an account of their Situation,
Temperature, Productions, Nature of the Soil, and Quality of the
Inhabitants. _America_, lying Westward of the _Azores_, and the Worlds
Meridian, is by some suppos’d to consist of one vast Island, and several
lesser ones, scatter’d about it: Nor can this supposition be thought
vain, if, as many think, it be inviron’d on the North-side, as toward
the East, South, and West it is known to be; East and South, by the
_Atlantick Ocean_; and West, by _Mar del Zur_: But because the
North-West Passage, though attempted by many, as _Nelson_, _Davis_,
_Forbisher_, _Button_, _Smith_, _Hudson_, and others, hath not yet by
any been fully discover’d; so that it is not certainly known whether
_America_ be joyn’d to _Greenland_, and the _Arctick_ Region, by a
continu’d Tract of Land, or sever’d by the Ocean: We shall follow the
method of those Geographers, who, reputed sufficiently Authentick, have
divided this new World into Islands, and two grand _Peninsula_’s joyn’d
together by an _Isthmus_, or Neck of Land, call’d _The Straight of
Darien_, by some _The Straight of Panama_, lying almost under the
Equinoctial Line, and extending in length from _Nombre de Dios_
Southward above a hundred Miles, and from East to West seventeen Miles
over in the narrowest place. Of these two grand _Peninsula_’s the
Northern is generally call’d _America Mexicana_, from _Mexico_ the chief
City of the Province, properly call’d _Mexicana_; which was heretofore
without doubt the most potent, rich, and flourishing of all the Kingdoms
of the _Indians_, at least on the North-side of the _Isthmus_. In the
division of the several Provinces of _America_, as well those of the
Northern as of the Southern Continent, we find so various an account
among the several Geographers that have written of them (not any two of
them agreeing in one and the same order) that to reconcile the differing
methods of so many disagreeing Authors would be an endless work:
wherefore we shall pitch upon the surest course, and not omitting the
mention of any of the Provinces taken notice of by the said Authors,
hereby endeavor to take in whatsoever material hath been observ’d by all
of them, and by the way take occasion to shew how one differs from
another in the distribution of them. Those therefore of the Northern
_America_ (that as near as can be we may bring the design of many into
one) seem most fitly describ’d in this following order: 1. _Estotiland_;
2. _Terra Laboratoris_, or _Nova Britannia_; 3. _Canada_, or _Nova
Francia_; 4. _Nova Scotia_; 5. _New England_; 6. _New Netherlands_, now
call’d _New York_, as being in the possession of the _English_; 7. _New
Holland_; 8. _New Swedeland_; 9. _Apalchen_, now call’d _Virginia_; 10.
_Florida_; 11. _Jucatan_; 12. _Honduras_; 13. _Nicaragua_; 14.
_Veragua_; 15. _Costarica_; 16. _Anien_; 17. _Nova Hispania_; 18.
_Guacatimala_; 19. _Nova Gallicia_; 20. _Nova Biscaia_; 21. _Nova
Mexico_; 22. _Cibola_; 23. _Nova Granata_; 24. _Tontonteac_; 25.
_Quivira_; 26. _Nova Albion_; to which by most Authors is added
_California_; which being an Island we thought fit to reserve to be
spoken of amongst the Islands, as also _Terra Nova_, or _New-found
Land_; which last lies utmost West, as the other East of Northern
_America_. Some there are also (and particularly _Monsieur de Martini_)
who among the above-mention’d Provinces have inserted _Greenland_,
though doubtless with little reason, since though it be granted that it
is not divided by any Sea, yet it is evident, if any credit may be given
to all modern Maps and Globes, that the greatest part of _Greenland_
lies in the Hemisphere of the known World; and therefore we have judg’d
it most convenient to refer the particular mention thereof to the
Description of the _Arctick_ Region.

The Islands of _Northern America_ are 1. _Terra Nova_, or _New-found
Land_; 2. The _Island of Assumption_; 3. The _Bermudas_, or
_Summer-Island_; 4. _Hispaniola_; 5. _St. John Porto Rico_; 6. _Cuba_;
7. _Jamaica_; 8. The _Lucayes_; 9. The _Caribes_, or _Antillæ_; 10.
_Margarita_; 11. _Cubagua_; 12. _La Trinidad_; 13. _Tabago_; 14.
_California_, the biggest of all the _American_ Islands.

The length of the _West-Indies_ is generally computed to be from the
utmost South of _Terra Magellanica_, to the farthest North of
_Estotiland_, about six thousand _English_ Miles, reaching from six
Degrees of Northern, to fifty three of Southern Latitude; the breadth
from _St. Michael_ or _Piura_ Westward, to _Parabaya_, a Town on the
Coast of _Brasil_ Eastward, three thousand nine hundred Miles, and the
whole compass thirty thousand.


                               SECT. II.
                              Estotiland.

That the _English_ have been very great Undertakers of Voyages and
Discoveries toward the North-West, appears by the denomination of divers
places, both from the Persons which have Sail’d thitherward, and also
from such of our own Countrey Names as were thought fit to be there
fix’d, as beyond the _Arctick Circle_ are Sir _James Lancaster’s Sound_,
Sir _Dudley Diggs’s Cape_, Queens _Annes Foreland, Cumberland Isles,
Davis’s Straight, &c._ on this side toward the _Arctick Circle_,
_Button_’s and _Brigg_’s _Bay_, _Hudson_’s _Sea_, otherwise term’d _Mare
Christianum_, out of which more Westerly runs a narrow Sea call’d
_Hudson_’s _Straight_: beyond _Hudson_’s _Sea_ towards the _Arctick
Circle_ is a place call’d _New North-Wales_; and on this side answerable
to it, between _Button_’s _Bay_ and the _Christian Sea_, lies _New
South-Wales_; all which places we find generally set down in the
_American_ Hemisphere, but in the Geographical Discourses thereof little
is said of them, if so much as nam’d. The farthest part of Land
Northward, between _Hudson_’s _Gulph_ and _Hudson_’s _Straight_, betwixt
fifty seven and sixty Degrees of Northern Latitude, goes generally by
the Name of _Estotiland_, I mean that properly so call’d (for
_Estotiland_ is by some as largely taken as _Canada_, by _Cluverius_,
_Golnitzius_, _Peter du Val_, and others, namely for all that Tract of
Land extending from that supposed _Straight of Anian_, which divides
_America_ from _Asiatick Tartary_, as far as the utmost point of Land
that shoots toward the _Atlantick Ocean_) which Southerly towards _Terra
Laboratoris_ is bounded with a River vulgarly call’d _Rio Nevado_, or
_The Snowy River_. _Estotiland_ seems to have deriv’d its Name from its
lying more Easterly than the rest of the Provinces, and, according as
_Nova Britannia_ is plac’d in some Charts, might very well be taken for
the same, though it hath not been so term’d by any Author, but rather
_Terra Laboratoris_, _Cortereatis_, and _Nova Britannia_ are generally
receiv’d to be all one.

[Sidenote: First discovery of _Estotiland_.]

[Sidenote: The Nature of the People.]

This Province is affirm’d by _Matthias Quadus_, and _J. Antonius
Maginus_, to have been the first discover’d Countrey of the new World,
and that by _Antonius Zeno_, a Patrician of _Venice_, in the Year of our
Lord 1390. which was long before the Expedition of _Columbus_, through
the encouragement of _Zichmus_, King of the Isle of _Friezland_; but by
whomsoever found out, or at whatsoever time, it is commonly affirm’d to
be not ill furnish’d with Provisions of all sorts, as Beasts, Birds,
Fish, Fowl, and Fruits, having a Soil indifferent fertile, in respect of
the coldness of the Climate. The People in general (for some there are
that live wild and salvage up and down the Woods, and go naked, whereas
the Clothing of the Countrey is the Skins of Beasts and of Sea-Calves,
call’d _Morses_) are reported not onely tolerably civil, but also
ingenious and expert both in mechanick Arts, and other necessary
Faculties, insomuch that the first Voyagers to this place are said to
have observ’d of them upon this first Discovery, That they sow’d Corn,
brew’d Beer and Ale, and Traded by Sea to _Greenland_, _Friezland_, and
other places, to the distance of fifteen hundred Miles; and that they
were not altogether void of the use of Letters, but that their Character
was onely proper to themselves and not intelligible by any other Nation:
Moreover, there is a certain Tradition, that there was here and there
some little knowledge of the _Latine_ Tongue amongst them, and that
there were found divers _Latine_ Books in a Library of one of their
Kings; the reason of which, if true, is conjectur’d to be from certain
_Europeans_ who understood that Language, having in Ages past suffer’d
shipwrack upon those Coasts, where chancing to abide either through
constraint or choice, they might haply at their Decease leave behind
them some Books and other Monuments of the _Latine_ Tongue. They were
observ’d to use such a kind of Javelin or short Dart, as was known to be
us’d by the People of _Java_, and some other Islands of the
_East-Indies_; whereupon it seems not wholly improbable, that they might
for a long time have entertain’d Traffick and Correspondence with them.

[Sidenote: Description of the _Morses_.]

The _Morses_, or Sea-Calves before mention’d, are about the bigness of a
young Heifer, the Hunting of which by the Natives, who take them in
great numbers, is to them in the stead of Whale-fishing, which is not
there so good, for they draw a great quantity of Train-Oyl out of them.
On each side of the Jaw of this amphibious Creature (for it is said to
live very much on the Land, as well as in the Water) there sticks out a
crooked Tusk, winding downward like an Elephants _Proboscis_, above a
Cubit in length, and as white and hard as Ivory: It is esteem’d of great
vertue, at least it passes for such among those who take it for other
than what it is, for it is frequently vended for Unicorns-horn; of which
imposture Dr. _Brown_ takes notice, and gives a Caution against in his
_Vulgar Errors_.

This Countrey is suppos’d, and that probably enough, to have store of
Brass and Iron Mines; but for the Mines of Gold and Silver, which some
have imagin’d there, the Northerly Situation of the Countrey, and by
consequence the coldness of the Climate, give sufficient cause to
question the truth of any such assertion. What chief Towns, Cities,
Rivers and Mountains there are in this Province, is not yet deliver’d by
any, onely _Maginus_ and _Quadus_ make mention of four principal Rivers,
which disperse themselves through the Countrey, and take their source
out of a great Mountain in the midst thereof.


                               SECT. III.
                           Terra Laboratoris.

[Sidenote: Situation.]

_Terra Laboratoris_, by some call’d _Nova Britannia_, by others
_Corterealis_, (though there are some who make _Laboratoris_ and
_Corterealis_ two distinct Countreys, comprehended, according to _Peter
du Val_, under _Nova Britannia_, as the more general Province; or,
according to _Cluverius_, under _Canada_) lies from about fifty four to
fifty seven Degrees of Northern Latitude, between _Estotiland_ and the
River _Canada_, which _Maginus_ and some others, though for what reason
is not express’d, name _Fretum trium Fratrum_, _The Bay of the three
Brethren_; others, _The River of St. Laurence_, and is, according to the
said Author, of so vast a bigness, that the Mouth of it extends it self
thirty five _Italian_ Miles wide; likewise of such a length, as to have
been navigated a continu’d Voyage of eight hundred Miles. The
denomination of _Terra de Laborador_, or _Laboratoris_, seems probably
enough conjectur’d to be from the cultivability (if one may so term it)
of the Soil, or its aptness for Cultivation or Tillage; that is, because
by the painful Hand of the Labourer or Husband-man it may be rendred so
fertile, as to yield all sorts of Grain and Fruits; haply in allusion to
that fruitful Countrey of _Campania_ in _Italy_, vulgarly known by the
Name of _Terra di Lavoro_. As for the Appellation of _Terra
Corterealis_, it need not be question’d, but that it derives it self
from _Gaspar Corterealis_, a _Portuguese_ Gentleman, who about the Year
of our Lord 1500. is thought by some to have made the first discovery of
these Parts; though Sir _Sebastian Cabot_ a _Venetian_, is more
generally believ’d to have been the Man that (under the favour and
countenance of _Henry_ the Seventh, King of _England_) first discover’d
them, at least the adjoyning Island _Terra Nova_, or _New-found Land_;
but just onely discover’d, being hinder’d the farther prosecution of
that Design, by the important Affairs in which the said King was about
that time involv’d; neither did _Corterealis_, whether he was the first,
or came after, do any more, for returning within a year after his first
setting out, he was never heard of; nor, as _Osorius_ a _Portuguese_
Historian writes, any of his Company, being all suppos’d to have been
drown’d by Shipwrack; and in like manner _Michael Corterealis_, who the
year following set forth with two Ships in quest of his Brother
_Gaspar_. Upon which series of Misfortunes the _Portuguese_ being wholly
discourag’d, and giving over this Design, the _French_ of _Armorica_ or
_Bretany_ succeed them in it with somewhat better success about the Year
1504. whereupon it came to be term’d _Nova Britannia_, or _New Britain_.
The ancient Inhabitants of this place were formerly of a Nature, like
the generality of the _American_ People, somewhat bruitish and salvage,
but by long conversation with the _French_, are said to have cast off
their original wildness, and become more civilly manner’d: they are very
jealous of their Wives, by report much addicted to Soothsaying, though
otherwise having little of Religion, or of any other kind of Learning;
they dwell for the most part in Caves under Ground, feed chiefly upon
Fish, and are accounted most expert Archers. Whatever places the
_French_ have built here besides, those of chiefest note are _St.
Maries_, _Cabo Marzo_, and _Brest_.


                               SECT. IV.
                         Canada, or New France.

[Sidenote: Situation.]

_Canada_, as it is taken for one and the same Province with _New
France_, contains _New France_, properly so call’d, _Nova Scotia_,
_Norumbega_, and some adjoyning Islands, as the _Canada_ of _Cluverius_,
lying more North-Westerly, comprehends (as we have already intimated)
_Estotiland_, _Laboratoris_, and _Corterealis_, and, according to the
most modern Division (for that of _Cluverius_ neither consents with the
latest Authors, nor agrees with exact Survey, it being nam’d _Canada_,
in respect the River _Canada_ runs through it) hath on the North _Terra
Corterealis_, on the South _New England_, and on the East the Ocean, and
hath between forty five and fifty two or fifty three Degrees of Northern
Latitude. The River _Canada_ is judg’d to be the largest of all the
Rivers of _America_, as those Rivers generally the largest of all in the
World besides; it rises in the Western parts of this Province which
remain yet undiscover’d, and in some places spreads it self into huge
Lakes, some of them a hundred Miles in compass, with many little Islands
dispersed up and down in them, and so running from the West about a
hundred Leagues, falls at last into the North part of _St. Lawrence
Bay_, being that wide _Emboucheure_ of thirty five Miles breadth already
mention’d. This River is extraordinary full of Fish, among which there
is one sort more remarkable than the rest, call’d by the Inhabitants
_Cadhothuis_, having Heads resembling the Heads of Hares, and Bodies as
white as Snow; they are taken for the most part before the Isle _de
Lievres_. The Countrey on both sides of the River is pleasant and
indifferently fertile, especially towards the South-West, where upwards
from the River the Ground rises into many little Hills, invested most of
them with Vines, with which and several other sorts of Trees this
Countrey abounds, being well water’d with a great many lesser Streams,
all of them falling into the River _Canada_.

[Sidenote: First discovery.]

That this Countrey is term’d _New France_, from having been discover’d
by the _French_, at least more fully than before, there needs no
question to be made; but whether _Joannes Verrazanus_, under _Francis_
the First of _France_, or _Sebastian Cabot_ before spoken of, were the
first in this Discovery, may admit of something of dispute: the _Cabots_
indeed, (for _John_ the Father is by some mention’d to have accompanied
his Son) who by all are own’d the first Discoverers of _New-found-Land_
and _Terra de Baccalaos_, are also commonly reputed to have first found
out the Province of _New France_, together with some parts adjacent,
though perhaps it might be upon this Ground that _Terra de Nova_, or
_New-found-Land_, not being known at first to be an Island, _New France_
and that might be taken for one continu’d Province; and it appears so
much the more probable, because _Canada_, or _Nova Francia_, is by some
call’d _Terra Nova_; however it be, or whoever were the first
Adventurers, _Quarteri_ and _Champlain_ are the two _French_-men that
have gain’d so much fame by making a more ample and particular search
into these parts, that this Province may seem from thence to have
sufficient claim to the Title of _New France_, whereof that part more
especially so call’d, lies on the North-side of the River _Canada_, and
Southward to _Terra Corterealis_. The Winter is here very long, and so
much the more severe by reason of a cold North-West Wind which blows
most part of the Winter Season, and brings with it so thick a Snow, that
it continues upon the Ground most commonly till after _May_. The
Countrey is for the most part wooddy, but in the Champain parts thereof
very fruitful of Corn, and all sorts of Grain, especially Pulse: It hath
also Fish, Fowl, wild Deer, Bears, Marterns, and Foxes in abundance, and
of Hares such plenty, that one of the little Islands belonging to this
Province, is by the _French_ nam’d _L’Isle des Lievres_, or _The Island
of Hares_: But the most peculiar Commodity belonging to this Countrey is
the _Esurgnuy_, a kind of Shell-Fish, extraordinary white, and approv’d
of singular vertue for the stanching of Blood; to which purpose they
make Bracelets of them, not onely for their own use, but also to vend
them to others; but _John de Laet_ and others have observ’d no other
than a superstitious use of them amongst the Salvages, in their Funeral
Rites for the Dead: the manner of their taking it is very remarkable;
for when any one is condemn’d to die, or taken Prisoner, they cut off
all his fleshy parts in long slices, and then throw him into the River,
where they let him lie twelve hours, and at last pulling him out again
find his Wounds full of _Esurgnui_. _Quadus_ and _Maginus_ make mention
of three ancient Towns, namely _Canada_ (denominated as the Province,
from the River) _Hochelai_ and _Hochchelaga_, giving Name to a Territory
about it, which Geographers either take no notice of, or make some
question of the being of such Towns; however, a late Describer of the
_West-Indies_, not mentioning the other two, gives this description of
the last, _viz._ _Hochchelaga_:

“This City (saith he) said to be the Seat and Residence of a King of
this Country whom the Natives, at least some of them, acknowledge and
reverence, carrying him sometimes in great pomp upon their Shoulders
sitting upon a Carpet of Beasts Skins, is situate far within Land, at a
distance of six or seven Leagues from the River _Canada_, and is a kind
of fortifi’d place, encompass’d about with a threefold Range of Timber
Ramparts one within another, of about two Rods high from the Ground,
with cross Planks, or pieces of Timber jutting out, on purpose to hinder
an Enemy’s Scaling or getting up; towards the top there is as it were a
Scaffold or Gallery fram’d, from whence they may throw down Stones of
which there is always good store ready, or what else to annoy the
Assailants: It hath one onely Gate for Entrance, and that likewise well
fortifi’d after their manner: There are guess’d to be in it fifty or
sixty great Houses, built (as the maner of the _Americans_ that live in
Houses usually is) in a square Figure, each side being about fifty Foot
long, or more, and sixteen or twenty broad, but not many Stories high;
and in the midst of the Court or void space, a place to make their Fire,
and do other necessary work about it. Moreover the Territory round about
this Town is both rich in Soil, and pleasant in Prospect.”

Besides these three above-mention’d Towns there are several others,
which are not untaken notice of in the most modern Descriptions and
Maps, _viz._ 1. _Stadac_, or _Stadacone_, somewhat Westward of a small
Isle call’d _The Isle d’Orleance_; 2. _Quebeque_, which being made a
Colony of the _French_, and the Natives expell’d, came to be Entituled
_St. Croix_; 3. _Tadoussac_, which lies in that part of the Countrey
denominated from the River _Saguenay_, and by some call’d at this day
_Nouvelle Biscaye_, a delightful place, and full of stately Trees, and
hath likewise a good and safe Haven, capable of receiving twenty Ships;
4. _Trois Rivieris_, or three Rivers; 5. _Monreal_; 6. _Sillery_; 7.
_Richelieu_; besides two strong Castles or Forts, _Franceroy_ and St.
_Lewis_; the First built by _Monsieur Robeval_ at his Landing here,
about the Year 1540. the other design’d for a Colony, in the Year 1611.
by _Monsieur Champlany_, but hinder’d by the Invasion of the _Iroquois_.
The smaller Rivers that run out of the Gulph of St. _Lawrence_, and the
grand River _Canada_ towards the North, on which side chiefly lies this
Province, are, 1. _Chichesedec_, 2. St. _Margarite_, 3. _Lesquemin_, 4.
_Saquenay_, before-mention’d, 5. _Montonne_; and on the South side, the
River _Mary_. The principal Tribes of the ancient Natives of this
Countrey were; on the North side of _Canada_ the _Canadans_, the
_Betisiamites_, the _Hurons_, the _Algoniquins_, the _Quenongebins_, the
_Algoingequins_, the _Attagopantans_, the _Atticameques_, the
_Nipisiriniens_; and on the South side, the _Etechemins_, and the chief
Heads or Princes of these Tribes were call’d _Sagamores_.

[Sidenote: Strange Fish nam’d _Chaousarou_.]

_Jaques Quartier_ Complementing their King _Agouthanna_, took up his
Quarters a whole Winter at St. _Croix_, a Sandy Promontory, overflow’d
by the River _Canada_, into which falls the Lake _de Champlain_, grown
round about with Chestnut Trees; in it breeds the strange Fish call’d
_Chaousarou_, generally ten Foot long, with Heads like Sharks, and two
rows of Teeth in their Mouths, their Skins full of strong Scales, which
are sufficient Shields against Swords and Lances, are great devourers of
other Fish and Fowls, which they take after this manner, _viz._ they
swim amongst Reeds or Canes, and lie still with their Mouths open;
whereat the Birds sitting down upon them, are immediately swallow’d.

The Natives of _Nova Francia_ anoint their bodies with Oil; in the
Summer they go naked, and in the Winter mantle themselves in Furs. Their
Warlike Accoutrements are Darts and Clubs, but chiefly great Shields.
They are revengeful, cruel, and fraudulent; their Women common to all
Men, from fifteen to twenty, after which, Marrying, they become very
Chaste. Their Diet is _Indian_ Corn, fresh and salt Fish, Venison,
_Buffalo_’s and Beavers flesh; wiping their Fingers (when greasie) on
their Heads, or their Dogs backs, which wait for the Scraps.

[Sidenote: Funeral-Feast.]

At that season when the Corn covers the ground, to any heighth, they eat
Cockles, Dogs, dead Caryon, and the Skins wherewith they Clothe
themselves. When they have eaten their fill, they tabering on their
Bellies, cry, _Tapoue Mikispoun_, that is, _Verily I am satisfi’d_. They
give their Sick a speedy Cure, either immediately killing them, or
inhumanely exposing them to the Woods, to be devour’d by ravenous
Beasts, but if they die suddenly, they in howling tone pronounce _Ove,
Ove_, thereby to chase the Souls of the Deceas’d out of their Huts; they
stick the bodies on Woodden Prongs, cover them with Bark, and lay their
Clothes and Arms by them; all what remains of the Funeral Feasts is
burnt, whereas at other times, what e’re is brought on their Table they
eat, though ready to burst. They make the first Proofs of their Valour
by undergoing a most prodigious Torment, in this manner; Two by consent
tie their naked Arms together, on which they suffer burning Sulphur to
be pour’d, till the flesh starts from the bone; if either of them
shrink, or pull back his Arm, he is accounted by them ever after as an
ignominious and base Coward. They call God _Atahocan_, and believe that
one _Messou_ first drowning the world by a general Deluge, restor’d it
again after a wonderful manner, _viz._ _Messou_ hunting with Wolves,
they scented a Deer which being closely pursu’d, leap’d into a
neighboring Pool, the Wolves following it, were drown’d; _Messou_ coming
thither, stood amaz’d at a Bird, which inform’d him, that the Wolves
were pluck’d down, and held fast in the bottom by horrible Monsters,
whereupon he diving, the Pool immediately began to swell, and at last
the whole surface of the Earth to be overflow’d. _Messou_ afterwards let
a Raven flie to fetch a Clod of Earth, but in vain, for all the Land lay
drown’d in Water; at last a Rat diving to the bottom, brought a lump of
Earth, out of which _Messou_ restor’d the World; shot Arrows into Trees,
which became fruitful Branches. Here also reside an innumerable many
_Sorcerers_, call’d _Pillotoa_’s, which sometimes being possess’d with a
Frenzy, scourge themselves in a terrible manner, insomuch that the Blood
runs down by their sides: These People are held in great esteem, for
they boast themselves to have their Original from Heaven upon this
occasion, _viz._ _Ataensic_, a certain great Queen or Goddess, residing
above the Stars, had a sick Husband, who Dreamt that he should be
restor’d to his former health so soon as he could but taste of the
Fruits which grew on a Tree, whereby the Family of Heaven were kept
alive, but that the Tree must needs be cut down, which _Ataensic_
obeying, gave onely two blows, when the Tree, to her great amazement,
fell out of Heaven down to the Earth; there being by this means nothing
more left to eat in Heaven: _Ataensic_ follow’d the fallen Tree, and
being big with Child, bare a Daughter, which growing up to years, was
Deliver’d of two Daughters, _viz._ _Taoviscaron_ and _Jouskeha_, the
eldest of which slew the youngest: By these Fables we may discern their
obscure knowledge of _Noah_’s Flood, _Eve_’s Fall, and _Cain_’s Murder.
No less ridiculous is that which they believe concerning the Creation,
_viz._ That the Waters were inclos’d within a Frog, which _Jouskeha_
causing to be cut open, all Streams and Rivers issuing out, had their
Original from thence: This done, _Jouskeha_ open’d a Pit, out of which
came all sorts of Beasts; they ascribe a Bodily shape to the Soul, as
also Immortality, but that they live together in a great Village towards
the West; from which removing sometimes, they knock at the Doors of
their former Friends in the Night, and sow deserted Grounds: That the
Journey towards the Village in which the Souls reside is very strange;
the Highway thither beginning at a Rock nam’d _Ecaregniendi_, where they
first Paint their Faces, which done, they go to a Hut inhabited by an
old Man, nam’d _Osotrach_, who takes the Brains out of the Souls Head;
after which they walk to a broad River, which they cross on a narrow
Plank or Bridge, on which a Dog encountring, forces them to leap into
the Water, which carries them down to the foremention’d Village. They
acknowledge one _Oki_ for the Governor of the Sea, and seasons of the
Year: They also Religiously Worship the Rock _Tsankchi Arasta_, which
they believe some ages ago was once a Man, but afterward Transform’d
into a Rock, in which a _Dæmon_ resides, who can make their Journies
either successful or dangerous, wherefore they offer him Tobacco. Their
opinion of Thunder is likewise very ridiculous, for they say that the
Devil endeavoring to vomit a horrible Serpent, by straining to evacuate
the same, rents the Clouds, and occasions Thunder. Lastly, They relate
of a Dwarf call’d _Thakabech_, who climb’d on the top of a Tree, which
by his blowing thereon grew so high, that it touch’d the Clouds, and
_Thakabech_ easily stept into them, where he found all sorts of delight
and pleasure; but having a Sister on Earth, descended again along the
Tree, and fetching his Sister, conducted her above the Stars; mean
while, _Thakabech_ going in the Night to see if he had taken any thing
in his Net which he had pitch’d, found it full of Fire, and observing
the same very narrowly, saw that he had taken the Sun, but durst not
approach the same, by reason of its great heat; but making a Mouse, sent
her to gnaw the Net in pieces, and set the Sun at liberty. Every twelfth
year they keep an extraordinary great Funeral-Feast; for on the Set-time
they flock from all parts to the appointed place, every one carrying
thither the Bodies or Bones of their Deceas’d Friends, wrapt up in
Clothes, and hang them over their Meat, which they eat singing; such
fond and Superstitious Conceits make up the Religion of these poor
deluded People.


                                SECT. V.
                        Accadia, or Nova Scotia.

_Nova Scotia_, or _New Scotland_, formerly call’d _Accadia_, is commonly
accounted a part of _New France_, (_viz._ that part which lying on the
South side of the River _Canada_, and shooting South-Easterly into a
bosom of the Sea, forms it self into a _Peninsula_, between the Gulph of
St. _Lawrence_, and the Bay _Francoise_) nevertheless, because of the
different concernments of this part of the Countrey, in regard the right
of claim to several places in this district, most especially of all
_Nova Francia_ besides, hath been long in dispute between _Us_ and the
_French_, it will be most convenient to Treat of it apart; and because
the Series of Affairs, from its first discovery, till of late years,
appears faithfully represented on the _English_ part, in a Remonstrance
Address’d to the King and Council by Sir _Lewis Kirk_, and his Brother
_John Kirk_ Esquire; it will not be amiss (onely adding some few things
upon occasion) to follow exactly the Narration of Affairs, deliver’d in
the said Remonstrance to this effect.


  “1. The whole Tract or Space of Land in _America_, lying on either
  side of the River _Canada_, which a long time since were known by
  the Names of _Nova Francia_, and _Nova Scotia_, were at first
  discover’d and found out by the _English_, in the time of _Henry_
  the Seventh, King of _England_; which Expedition was first
  undertaken at the Command and Charges of that King; afterwards
  further’d and carry’d on by the favorable Aspect of Queen
  _Elizabeth_; so that in process of time, for many years together,
  the said Tract of Ground, with absolute Priviledge of free Commerce,
  fell under the Jurisdiction and Power of the Crown of _England_:
  Neither was it unto any other _Christian_ Princes, or their Subjects
  more clearly known or discover’d, untill about the year 1600. some
  of the _French_ understanding the benefit arising by Traffique in
  the River of St. _Lawrence_, having formerly seiz’d upon that Tract
  of Land, situate on the North side of the said Floud or River
  _Canada_, did afterwards, in _Anno 1604._ (_under the Conduct of_
  Peter de Gua, _Lord_ of Monts, _who in the year 1606. was follow’d
  by_ Monsieur de Pourtrincourt) Possess themselves of _L’Accadie_,
  lying on the South side of the said River, naming the whole _Nova
  Francia_, challenging to themselves for many years, at least _de
  facto_, the Possession thereof, with sole liberty of Commerce there.

  “2. In _Anno 1621._ King _James_ of _England_ looking upon the
  Possession gotten there by the _French_, as upon an Invasion, did by
  his Letters Patents Grant unto Sir _William Alexander_ a _Scotchman_
  (_Created afterwards Earl of_ Sterling, _by King_ Charles _the
  First_) _L’Accadie_, by the Name of _Nova Scotia_; who in the year
  1622, and 1623. _after Sir_ Samuel Argal _had driven out_ Biard
  _and_ Masse, _and demolishing their Fort, carry’d them Prisoners_ to
  Virginia; having obtain’d the Possession thereof, they Planted a
  Colony therein, and kept Possession for about two years after, until
  such time, as upon the Marriage of his Majesty King _Charles_ the
  First, with the Lady _Henrietta Maria_, the said _L’Accadie_, or
  _Nova Scotia_, was by Order of the King of _England_ return’d into
  the Possession of the _French_.

  “3. Afterwards a War arising between his Majesty King _Charles_ the
  First, and _Lewis_ the XIII. _Anno 1627._ and _1628_. Sir _David
  Kirk_ and his Brethren and Relations of _England_, did by vertue of
  his Majestie’s Commission, send to Sea (at their great charge) first
  three, afterwards nine Ships, with Warlike Preparations for
  recovering of the Possession of the said Lands, lying on either side
  of the said River _Canada_, and to expel and eject all the _French_
  Trading in those Parts, wherein they had good Success; and in _Anno
  1627._ did there seize upon about eighteen of the _French_ Ships,
  wherein were found a hundred thirty five Pieces of Ordnance,
  design’d for relief of the _Royal Fort_ in _L’Accadie_, and
  _Quebeck_ in _Nova Francia_, under the Command of _Monsieur de
  Rocmand_, and _Monsieur de la Tour_, Father of _de la Tour_,
  Governor of the said _Royal Fort_, whom, together with the said
  Ships and Guns, they brought into _England_; and in the year 1628.
  they Possess’d themselves of the whole Region of _Canada_ or _Nova
  Francia_, situate on the North side of the River, together with the
  Fort or Castle of _Quebeck_, Sir _Lewis Kirk_ being then constituted
  Governor of the place, the _French_ being then either expell’d or
  convey’d into _England_, and the Arms of the King of _England_ being
  publickly there erected, and every where plac’d; and before the year
  1628. it was brought to pass by the said Sir _William Alexander_,
  (assisted both by the advice and charge of the said _Kirk_) that in
  the parts of _L’Accadie_, or _Nova Scotia_, on the South side of the
  River _Canada_, the whole place, with the Forts thereon built, being
  by him subdu’d, presently came under the Power of the King of
  _England_; that Region on the South side falling into the Possession
  of the said Sir _William Alexander_, and that on the North side,
  into the Possession of the _Kirks_.

  “4. On _March 29. 1632._ a Peace being concluded between King
  _Charles_ the First, and _Lewis_ the XIII. it was amongst other
  things on the part of the King of _England_ agreed, That all the
  Forts, as well in _L’Accadie_ as in _Nova Francia_, should be
  restor’d into the Possession of the Subjects of the _French_ King,
  which was exactly perform’d on the part of the _English_, though to
  the great damage of the _Kirks_; but on the part of the _French_,
  although it was agreed, as in the fourth and fifth Articles of Peace
  is set down, (to which reference is had) yet nothing was ever
  perform’d of their parts; so that the _Kirks_ did thereupon suffer
  loss, to the value of five thousand Pounds _Sterl._ which were to be
  paid them by _Monsieur de Cane a French-man_, but remain unpaid to
  this day.

  “5. _Anno 1633._ the King of _England_ taking notice, that although
  the Forts and Castles, according to the League, were deliver’d up
  into the Possession of the _French_, (especially such as had been
  erected during their Possession thereof) yet that his _English_
  Subjects were not to be excluded from Trade or free Commerce, in
  those Regions that were first Discover’d and Possess’d by his
  Subjects, did, with the advice of his Council, by his Letters
  Patents, Dated _May 11. 1633._ upon consideration had of the
  Expences, which the said _Kirks_ had laid out upon the reducing of
  that Countrey with the Fort of _Quebeck_, to the value of
  50000^{lb.}; and also of their ready obeisance in resigning up the
  same on his Royal Command, Grant unto Sir _Lewis Kirk_, and his
  Brother _John Kirk_ and his Associates, for the term of thirty one
  years (not yet expir’d) full Priviledge, not only of Trade and
  Commerce in the River _Canada_, and places on either side adjacent,
  but also to Plant Colonies, and build Forts and Bulwarks where they
  should think fit.

  “6. By vertue of which Commission, Sir _Lewis Kirk_ and his Brother
  _John Kirk_, and his Associates, in the Moneth of _February_ next
  following, _viz._ in 1633. set forth a Ship call’d _The Merry
  Fortune_, Laden with Goods of a considerable value, consign’d to
  those parts, where during her Trading there, without any just
  offence given; and in time of Peace, she was by the _French_
  forceably seiz’d on, and carry’d into _France_ and her Lading, as if
  she had been lawful Prize, Confiscated; whereupon the _Kirks_
  suffer’d loss, to the value of twelve thousand Pounds. And although
  the Lord _Scudamore_, Ambassador in _France_, by the King of
  _Englands_ special Command, and the said _John Kirk_ being there in
  Person, by the King’s Command, did often earnestly urge, that the
  Moneys due to the said _Kirks_, and the said Ship, with her Lading,
  might be restor’d, which for no other cause had been seiz’d upon and
  sold, but only for that by the King’s Commission she was found
  Trading at _Canada_; yet he could obtain nothing, but after some
  years fruitless endeavors return’d into _England_ without
  accomplishing his desires.

  “7. In the year 1654. _Cromwel_, although an unjust Usurper of the
  Government, yet upon consideration of the Premises, taking a just
  occasion for requiring the Possession of _L’Accadie_, sends forth
  several Ships under the Command of one _Sedgwick_, who by vertue of
  the Authority granted him by _Cromwel_, assaulted and subdu’d the
  aforesaid Forts in _Nova Scotia_, and restor’d them into the
  Possession of the _English_: And although in the year 1655. a League
  of firm Peace and Amity being concluded between _Cromwel_ and the
  _French_ King, the _French_ Ambassador did often urge the
  Restitution to the Possession of the _French_; yet for the same
  causes aforesaid, which had mov’d _Cromwel_ to seize upon them, it
  was thought fit still to retain the Possession of them; and although
  according to the purport of the twenty fifth Article of the Peace,
  Commissioners on both sides were to be appointed for the deciding
  and determining that Controversie; yet nothing was done therein,
  neither did the Commissioners ever meet within three Moneths, as in
  the twenty fourth Article of the Treaty was provided and agreed: So
  that now the case is very clear, that the Possession to the
  _English_ remains firm and just, and that the Forts and Bulwarks
  before specifi’d, are without all peradventure under the Power and
  Jurisdiction of the King of _England_.”


Since the Restauration of his present Majesty, the _French_ Ambassador
representing unto the King the Pretensions of the _French_ unto the
several Forts and other places in _Accadie_, and urging the
non-performance of the Articles of Agreement between _Oliver Cromwel_
and the _French_ King, mov’d the King of _England_, _As a profess’d
Enemy to all Violence_, for a Restitution of all the Forts and other
places which were then in the possession of the _English_: Not long
after which, whether upon the Ambassadors request, or upon other
important Affairs intervening, or upon what other ground soever it were,
the _French_ were suffer’d to re-enter on the foresaid places, and do
yet keep Possession of them, till such time as the _English_ claim under
the just Title of the _Kirks_, shall meet with some fit occasion of
being reviv’d.

That which we suppose gives the _French_ so much the more confidence in
their claim of this Country, is their presumption upon the Expedition of
_James Quartier_, whom they will have to be the first Discoverer, if not
Possessor, not onely of the Isle of _Assumption_, but also of this Coast
of _Nova Francia_, not taking notice it seems of _Sebastian Cabot_,
under _Henry_ the Seventh.

The chief places of Note in this Countrey, are, 1. _Port Royal_, a
Colony of _French_, said to have been Planted there by _Monsieur de
Montz_ in 1604. by report, capable of receiving a thousand Ships; and in
1613. (the _French_ being driven out by Sir _Samuel Argal_, Governor of
_Virginia_, who took Prisoners _Biard_ and _Masse_, and demolish’d the
Fort at _Port Royal_) given by Patent, as aforemention’d, to Sir
_William Alexander_; afterwards by him sold again to the _French_; then
in the time of _Oliver Cromwel_ re-taken by Major _Sedgwick_; lastly,
re-possess’d by the _French_. 2. St. _Luke’s Bay_, or _Portua Mouton_.
3. _Gaspe_, or _Gachepe_. 4. _The Haven of Passepay._ 5. The _Bay de
Toutes Isles._ 6. _The Fort de la Heve._ 7. _The Cape of Sable._ Within
the Southern Point _Forchu_, lies the Isle _Longu_, which boasts of a
Silver Mine.

The most noted People of the ancient Inhabitants of _Accadie_ were the
_Iroquois_, lying most South-Westerly upon the Sea Coast, who us’d to
drive a great Trade in Beavers and other Commodities.

Westerly before the River _Chovacoet_ lies _Bacchus Isle_, full of
Vineyards.

[Sidenote: Remarkable manner of living.]

The Inhabitants thereof differ very much from other Salvages, for they
shave all the Hair from the Crown of their Head, wear long Locks behind,
pleited together, and stuck full of Feathers, Paint their Faces black
and red, and go arm’d with Clubs, Bows, Pikes, and Arrows pointed with
Fish-bones: They Till their Ground very handsomly, and divide their
Fields with Hedges; they Plant Tobacco, Vines, Cabbages, _Maiz_, and
divers Colour’d Beans; the stalks of the _Maiz_ serve in stead of Poles
for their Beans to run up upon.

Beyond _Cape de Rocher_ lies the brave Harbor _Beauport_, which is
secur’d from all Winds by an Isle which lies in the midst of it. The
Countrey Manur’d in most places, and Fruitful, feeds store of Men and
Cattel.

The Haven of _Malabar_ is surrounded in a manner with little Huts,
cover’d with Mats, which in the Middle of the Room have a hole for the
Smoke to go out at. The Southern shore is Sandy, and very dangerous.

For the more full exemplification of what concerns this part of _Nova
Francia_, we shall conclude with an account of all Material Passages
relating to the _French_, from their own Narrations as followeth.

[Sidenote: _Quartier_’s Expedition.]

[Sidenote: Scurvy, when known.]

[Sidenote: Exploit of _de la Roque_.]


  The first discoverer of this Coast was _Jaques Quartier_, sent out
  _Anno 1534._ by the _French_ King, _Francis_ the First, in which
  Expedition he spent five Months; and going from thence to St.
  _Male_, discover’d the Inlet _Lawrence_, _Terreneuf_, and
  _Natiscotec_. The following year prosecuting his Voyage, he Sail’d
  into the great River _Canada_, and Winter’d near St. _Croix_, where
  he lost divers of his Men by the Scurvy, a Distemper till that time
  altogether unknown; and such was his condition, that none of his Men
  had escap’d with life, had not the Inhabitants taught him to cure
  the same with the Bark and Leaves of the Tree _Annedda_; with which
  many recovering, _Quartier_ Weigh’d Anchor, and treacherously
  carry’d the King _Donnacona_ with many of his Nobles, Prisoners to
  _France_; but most of them dying, _Quartier_ brought only a few of
  them back with him in his third Voyage, six years after the first,
  when arriving in the Haven St. _Croix_, he cast up a strong Fort,
  which he nam’d _Charlesbourg Royal_, where he staid a whole Winter.
  _Joan de la Roque_, whom the _French_ King had made Governor of
  _Quartier_’s new-discover’d Countries, Sailing thither with three
  Ships, met with _Quartier_’s Fleet near _Terreneuf_; from whence he
  was then going home, because he saw no hopes of subduing the
  Salvages with so small a Force as he had brought with him from
  _France_. But _de la Roque_ endeavoring to make a further discovery
  of _Canada_, Sail’d up the River _Saguenay_, where spending both
  time and Money, he was Commanded home by the _French_ King, and the
  fruitless Expeditions lay dead till about 1604.

[Sidenote: Of _de Monts_.]

[Sidenote: Of _Poutrincourt_.]

  When _Peter de Monts_ obtaining Letters Patents to Trade for Furs in
  the foremention’d Countries, Sail’d with two Ships beyond _Accadie_,
  up St. _Lawrence Bay_, where he Landed on the Isle St. _Croix_,
  where of ninety seven Men, with which he staid there a whole Winter,
  he lost thirty five; but having fresh Supplies sent him from
  _France_, he remov’d to _Port Royal_, where leaving forty Men, he
  return’d home; these forty being reduc’d to twenty three, and in
  great want, walking along the Sea-shore in a despairing condition,
  espy’d a Ship coming up with full Sail, which upon nearer approach,
  prov’d a _French_ Vessel, of which _Poutrincourt_ was Commander, who
  receiving his wretched Countrey-men with great joy, took them with
  him to _Port Royal_, being sent thither on purpose to settle a
  Plantation in _Accadie_: Meanwhile the Letters Patent granted to
  _Monts_, being call’d in, the first Planters in _Port Royal_ were
  forc’d to desert the same, and return home; and also _Poutrincourt_
  returning, came back again three years after to _Port Royal_, where
  finding the Houses standing as he had left them, he Manur’d the
  Countrey all about, and endeavoring to Plant _Christianity_ among
  the Natives, Christen’d among others an _Accadian_ Lord, who was
  above a hundred years old; all which _Poutrincourt_ Sailing back to
  France, related at the Court.

[Sidenote: Remarkable Transactions of some _Jesuits_.]

  The _Jesuits_ being also inform’d thereof, obtain’d leave of the
  Queen to send _Peter Biard_ and _Euemond Masse_ thither, on
  pretence, that _Henry_ the Fourth had himself promis’d them the same
  Priviledge in his Life time. But the Merchants at _Diep_, which were
  concern’d in the new Plantations with _Poutrincourt_, opposing the
  going over of the foremention’d _Jesuits_, express’d themselves very
  violent against them, and laid to their charge the Blood of the late
  King, which they said was yet reaking in _Paris_: _What assurance_
  (alleadg’d they) _had their Goods which were in the Custody of Men
  inclin’d to the_ Spaniards? _Must the_ Christian Religion _be
  promulgated? There are so many Orders of_ Monks _which may easily
  produce two Men; but if the Queen was resolv’d to send_ Jesuits
  _thither, they desir’d restauration of the Monies which they had
  disburs’d_: To which _Biard_ and _Masse_ harkening, gather’d up the
  demanded Monies, under pretence of being requir’d towards the
  Preaching of the _Christian Religion_ amongst these remote
  _Heathens_; by this means getting great Sums, they bought out the
  foremention’d Merchants, so that the new Plantations fell half to
  the _Jesuits_, who setting Sail, and arriving at _Port Royal_,
  turn’d all things topsiturvy, and so thwarted _Poutrincourt_ in his
  designs, that he was forc’d to complain to the _French_ Court of the
  _Jesuits_ oppression, whose aim it was to get all things into their
  own Possession; whereupon they Excommunicated _Poutrincourt_’s Son
  (who serv’d in his Father’s place at Court), and gain’d the Duke
  _Guereheville_ in _France_ to be of their Party, by promising him,
  that he should share in the new Plantations for a contracted Sum of
  Money: After this they receiv’d all sorts of Arms and Ammunition,
  with several Brass Guns, of the then King _Lewis_ the XIII. and
  other gifts Collected and gather’d out of their several Societies,
  for two new _Accadian_ Apostles. _Gilbert du Thet_, a subtile man of
  the same Order, transported their Necessaries.

  At this time all things going favorably with the _Jesuits_, they
  made themselves Masters of _Port Royal_, and began to raise a Fort
  on the River _Pemtagovet_; but there their happy Proceedings were
  stop’d, for Captain _Argal_ before-mention’d, Sailing thither in
  vindication of the _English_, was encounter’d by _du Thet_, (who
  firing the first Gun on _Argal_, was by him taken off with
  Chain-shot) and taking _Biard_ and _Masse_, carry’d them Prisoners
  to _Virginia_, and dismantled the Fort built at _Port Royal_, after
  which it was by King _James_ given by Patent to Sir _William
  Alexander_, as hath been already related, together with what of most
  remarkable hath happen’d since.


                               SECT. VI.
                              Norumbegua.

[Sidenote: Whence denominated.]

_Norumbegua_, lying between _Nova Scotia_ Northward, and _New England_
Southward, is so utterly not taken notice of by many as a distinct
Province, that it might seem to be swallow’d up and lost in the two
Countreys between which it lies, or at least to be thought a part of
_Virginia_ or _New England_ (for _Virginia_ largely taken is said to
contain _New England_, _Novum Belgium_, and _Virginia_, especially so
call’d) and that so much the rather, because the _Bessabees_, accounted
by _Sanson d’Abbeville_ an ancient People of _New England_, are written
to have liv’d near the River _Penobscot_, which is reckon’d to be the
same with _Pemtegovet_, or (as some will have it) _Norumbegua_, from
which, or from a certain great City of that Name, the Country for
fancy’s sake must needs be denominated; but since most commonly we find
it nam’d and treated of apart, it will not be improper to follow that
method, carrying the Bounds of _New England_ no farther Northward than
the River _Quinnebequi_ or _Sagadahoc_, and so determining the main part
of this Countrey to that space between the aforesaid River and
_Pemtegovet_, excepting a small Southerly portion upon the Banks of the
River _Chovacovet_; so that it appears chiefly situate under the forty
third Degree of Northern Latitude.

[Sidenote: Towns and Cities not certainly known.]

As for the Towns or Cities of this Province, there is but a very
uncertain account to be given, forasmuch as the pretended great City
_Norumbegua_, from whence the Province should take its Appellation, is
not acknowledg’d by any of the most authentick modern Writers, nor in
any late Voyage or Discovery any mention made either of that or any
other considerable Town or City. Dr. _Heylin_ supposeth it to be no
other than _Agguncia_, a poor little Village, that seems compos’d of a
company of Hutts or Sheaves, cover’d with the Skins of Beasts, or the
Barks of Trees. But the most favourable conjecture is, that it might
haply be the Ruines of an ancient Town, which the Natives call’d
_Arambeck_, and had probably deserted it long before the arrival of the
_Europeans_ in those parts; however, it is not very probable that the
Name of the Countrey should be deriv’d from this City, if ever there
were any such, or from the River, which appears to have been term’d
_Norumbegua_ on purpose to make way for this derivation, whereas
_Pemtegovet_ is the ancient Appellation that properly belongs to it; nor
hath any modern one been apply’d to it but that of _Rio Grande_, by
_Buno_ in his _Comment_ upon _Philip Cluverius_, upon what ground is
hard to tell, since it is observ’d by _Heylin_ and others, to be neither
large, nor otherwise much to be commended, being Navigable not above
twenty or thirty Miles, in respect of its many great Cataracts and Falls
of Water, an Inconvenience with which many other Rivers of _America_ are
prejudic’d, and rendred impassable.

Before and about the Mouth of this River, which is judg’d to be about
eight or nine Miles broad, lie many small Islands, or rather Hills,
inviron’d with Water, the chiefest of which is by the _French_ call’d
_La Haute Isle_, from the high and Mountainous appearance of it to those
that see it from afar off at Sea.

The aforemention’d _Buno_, though he names, as belonging to _Norumbega_,
these several places, _viz._ _Porto del Refugio_, _Porto Reale_,
_Paradiso_, _Flora_, and _Angolema_, from some obscure _French_
testimonies, without particularising any Author, yet he afterwards
confesses, that the Names given by the _French_, and those apply’d by
the _Spaniards_, are so various and disagreeing, and breed such a
confusion, that no Charts or Descriptions had concluded upon either.

As for those who will have _Norumbega_ deriv’d from _Norwegia_, in
respect of a Colony brought thither from _Norwey_, if the Etymologie be
not a little too much forc’d, the Invention may pass well enough till a
better be found out.

[Sidenote: The temperature and nature of its Soil.]

In this Countrey the temperature of the Air is not bad, nor the Soil
unfruitful, if it were well cultivated, chiefly towards the Rivers, and
where it is not either overgrown with Woods, or craggy with Hills and
mountainous Rocks: neither are the Woods unprofitable, for they afford
good Timber, and all kind of necessary and useful Wood, especially
Beeches, Fir-trees, Wallnut-trees, and other Nuts: The Plains are very
pleasant, and yield good Pasturage, onely the Maritime Coasts are so
shallow and full of Sands, that the Sailing near them is accounted
somewhat dangerous; and this may be imagin’d to be the reason that no
Authors have yet met with any Ports or Havens belonging to this
Countrey, which they have thought worthy their notice.

                              New England.


As _Canada_ is by some accounted a general Province, containing _New
France_, _L’Accadie_, _Norumbega_, and other places, so under _Virginia_
largely taken, are comprehended _New England_, _New Netherlands_, and
_Virginia_ properly so call’d; however, since that part which vulgarly
goes under the Name of _Virginia_ and _New England_ were possess’d, if
not discover’d, at several times, and their Plantations promoted and
propagated upon several occasions, and by distinct Interests, and since
_New England_ hath been look’d upon as a place considerable enough for
Persons of very eminent quality to concern themselves in it, we rather
are induc’d to consider this Countrey as a principal part, than as any
way depending on, or being any Branch or Portion of _Virginia_.

[Sidenote: Situation of _New England_.]

It lies between _Norumbega_, which it hath Northward, and _New
Netherlands_ Southward, from forty one to forty five Degrees of Northern
Latitude, in the midst of the temperate Zone, and paralell to _France_
and some part of _Italy_ in the Western Hemisphere, so that one would
think it should enjoy the same temperature of Air; but the contrary is
found, for that part which borders upon the Sea is colder, partly by
reason that the Sea-waves break the reflexion of the Sun-beams, partly
by reason of the abundance of Vapors, which mounting upward, abate the
ardor of them; but the more Inland parts of the Countrey are
indifferently warm: Moreover it hath been found by certain experience,
that those Countreys which look towards the East, or Sun-rising, are
colder than those which lie towards the West, or Sun-setting, and those
that have the Evening Winds on them, warmer than those which have the
Morning Winds; which being so, it should follow, that the temperature of
the Air in those Regions is peculiar to the Bodies of those of our
Nation, who being accustom’d to a Climate somewhat temperate, are
neither able to endure extremity of Cold, nor immoderate Heat: Yet there
are who affirm, that _New England_, though situate in the midst of the
temperate Zone, nevertheless feels both extremities of the two opposite
Zones, in the Summer the heat of the Torrid, and in the Winter the cold
of the Frigid.

[Sidenote: First discovery.]

As for the first discovery of this Countrey, it is not to be expected
otherwise than that of the discovery of those other Countreys hitherto
discours’d of, that is to say very uncertain; but because the _French_
boast of _Joannes Verrazanus_ (who though an _Italian_, was employ’d by
the French King _Francis_ the First) as the first Discoverer, not onely
of _Nova Francia_, as hath been already intimated, but also of this
Countrey and the adjoyning Coast and Regions, we shall not think it
impertinent to give from their own Relations, a brief view of his
Voyage, and afterwards a particular Description of the _English_
Plantations there, and of their Transactions, both one with another, and
between them and the Nations. The Narration of _Verrazanus_’s Voyage is
as followeth:

[Sidenote: Remarkable Voyage of _Verrazanus_.]


  “On command of the _French_ King _Francis_ the First, _John
  Verrazanus_, _Anno 1524._ setting Sail Westward from the _Canary_
  Isles, discover’d a low _American_ Coast, in thirty four Degrees
  North Latitude, inhabited by naked People, which behind the sandy
  Hills facing the Sea, Manur’d many fruitful Plains. Then Sailing a
  hundred Leagues along the Shore Northerly, he view’d a Countrey full
  of Vines, which grew up amongst the Boughs of high Trees; and
  Sailing up a pleasant River, Landed on the Island _Clandia_, full of
  woody Mountains: thence he stood for the main Continent; where after
  having visited a King, Clad in wrought Deer-skin, he Sail’d by a
  Bay, at whose Mouth appear’d a Rock in an Inlet, twenty Leagues;
  where appear’d five small Isles, all of them exceeding fruitful.
  After this (being got a hundred and fifty Leagues to the Northward)
  he found very salvage People, whose Heads appear’d through
  Bear-skins and Sea-Calves. By this time having _Terreneuf_ on his
  Starboard, he return’d back to _Diepe_.”


Thus far _Verrazanus_ made some discovery of the Coast, which hath since
not onely been farther inspected by the _English_, but also by them
Planted and call’d _New England_.

[Sidenote: The setling of Plantations.]

This Countrey, whether first discover’d by the said _Verrazanus_, or
together with the rest of largely-taken _Virginia_, by Sir _Walter
Raleigh_, or, as some say, by Captain _Gosnald_, in the Year 1602. was
so well known to the _English_ in the beginning of King _James_’s Reign
here, that the setling and carrying on of Plantations in this part of
_America_, was vigorously promoted by many of the most eminent Persons
in _England_: whereupon it was about the Year 1606. being the fourth
Year of the said King, granted by Patent to several Lords, Knights,
Gentlemen and Merchants, under the denomination of _The Plymouth
Company_, both in favour of those generous Spirits, who studied and
endeavor’d the good of the Publick by foreign Plantations, and
indulgence to those, who not well satisfi’d with the Government of
Church and State, and willingly transporting themselves and Families
thither, as to their _Asylum_, could more conveniently be spar’d than
the better affected part of the People: And although the Colonies at
first sent over succeeded not according to expectation, yet in a short
time there Plantations were brought to very great perfection. Captain
_Weimouth_, who had been employ’d there by the Lord _Arundel_ of
_Warder_, for the discovery of the North-West Passage, falling short of
his Course, hapned into a River on the Coast of _America_, call’d
_Pemmaquid_; from whence he brought five of the Natives for _England_,
three of whose Names were _Mannida_, _Skettwarroes_ and _Tasquantum_,
and Landing at _Plymouth_, presented them to Sir _Ferdinando Gorges_,
whom he made use of as Instruments for the farther advancement of these
Plantations: they were all of one Nation, but of several parts, and
several Families; he kept them with him three years, and observing in
them an inclination to vertuous Designs, and Spirits above the Vulgar,
he gain’d information from them what great Rivers ran up into the Land,
what Men of note were seated on them, what Power they were of, how
Ally’d, what Enemies they had, and the like; and taking some light from
thence, sent away a Ship, furnish’d with Men, and all kind of
Necessaries convenient for the Service intended, under the Command of
Captain _Henry Chaloung_, a Gentleman of a good Family, and very capable
for Undertakings of this nature; and giving him sufficient Instructions
what to do, sent along with him two of the said Natives for his better
Conduct and Direction, ordering him by all means to keep the Northerly
Gage as high as _Cape Briton_, till they had discover’d the Main, and
then to beat it up to the Southward as the Coast tended, till they found
by the Natives they were near the place to which they were assign’d. By
that time they were about a hundred Leagues off the Island of _Canara_,
the Captain fell sick of a Feaver, and the Winds being Westerly, his
Company shap’d their Course for the _Indies_, and coming to _St. John de
Porto Rico_, the Captain went ashore for the recovery of his Health,
whilst the Company took in Water, and such other Provisions as they had
present need of, and spent some time in Hunting, and other Recreations;
after which steering their intended Course, they were met with by the
_Spanish_ Fleet that came from the _Havana_, taken Prisoners and carried
into _Spain_, the Ship and Goods being confiscated, the Voyage
overthrown, and the Natives lost.

Not long after the setting out of _Chaloung_, _Thomas Haman_ was sent by
Sir _John Popham_, Lord Chief Justice of _England_, towards the River of
_Sagadehoc_, to the succour of _Chaloung_, if need were; but not finding
him, after he had scowr’d the Coast all about, he return’d back into
_England_.

Captain _Prinne_ was likewise sent from _Bristol_, who arriving happily
in those Parts, brought back with him at his return the most exact
Discovery of that Coast that ever had been gain’d till then.

A while after, at the Charge of the said Sir _John Popham_, a hundred
Men were sent to settle a Colony at _Sagadehoc_, under the Command of
_George Popham_, _Raleigh Gilbert_, Master of the Ship, who seated
themselves in a _Peninsula_, at the Mouth of this River; which
attempting to discover, they met with a Wood near to an Island, distant
from the Line about forty five Degrees, and some odd Seconds, where they
easily went on Shore. In the Year 1608. the Commander of the Colony
deceasing, and not long after him the Lord Chief Justice, who had been
the chief that had furnish’d them with fresh Supplies, they return’d for
_England_ in those Ships that had been sent them with Succours: At which
unexpected return, the Patrons of the Design were so offended, that for
a certain time they desisted from their Enterprizes. In the mean while
the _French_ making use of this occasion, Planted Colonies in divers
places, when Sir _Samuel Argal_ from _Virginia_ disturb’d their Designs,
and brought away Prisoners all he could lay hold on.

Suddenly after Captain _Hobson_ and divers others were set out with very
great Preparations, and with them two of the Natives which had been
detain’d for some time in _England_, whom they thought to have made use
of, the better to draw the rest of the Natives to their Commerce; but
because a little before twenty four of them had been treacherously dealt
with by one _Hunt_, they contracted from thence so great an animosity
towards the _English_, that Captain _Hobson_ was constrain’d to return
without effecting any thing.

In the Year 1614. Captain _John Smith_ being sent to Fish for Whales,
and seek after Mines of Gold and Silver, Landed upon the Island of
_Monahiggan_, where he found some store of Whales, but not such as those
by whose Oyl they use to make so much profit.

About the same time (two of the Natives being recover’d, _Erpenow_ of
_Capawick_, that had escap’d from Captain _Hobson_, and _Assacumet_ of
_Pemmaquid_, one of those that had been taken Prisoners with _Chaloung_)
Captain _Harly_, with Necessaries convenient for such a Voyage, was
dispatch’d away by Sir _Ferdinando Gorges_, the Earl of _Southampton_
favouring the Design, and furnishing him with some Land-Soldiers under
the Command of Captain _Hobson_, who not discourag’d with his former ill
Success, resolv’d upon a second Adventure.

In the Year 1615. Sir _Richard Hakings_ undertook a Voyage into those
Parts by authority of the Council of the second Colony, but by reason of
the great Wars among the Natives, his Observations could not be such as
might give any farther light than what had been already receiv’d.

Soon after which Captain _Dormer_ coming for _England_ from
_New-found-Land_, and Landing at _Plymouth_, apply’d himself to the
Governor, by whom he was dispatch’d away, with Direction to meet Captain
_Rocroft_, sent away a little before; but _Rocroft_ being dead by that
time _Dormer_ could come after him to _Virginia_, where he heard he was,
he returning to _Capawick_, was there set upon by _Erpenow_, the
foremention’d Salvage, and other _Indians_ that were Conspirators with
him; and within a short while after at _Virginia_, whither he went to be
cur’d of the Wounds he receiv’d in that Assassination, he fell sick and
died.

About the Year 1623. Captain _Robert Gorges_, newly come out of the
_Venetian_ War, was employ’d by the Council of _New Englands_ Affairs as
the Lieutenant-General, to regulate the Abuses of divers Fisher-men and
other Interlopers, who without License frequented those Coasts: for
which Service he had assign’d to him all that part of the main Land
situate upon the North-East side of the Bay of the _Messachasets_.

By these several Colonies sent so thick one after another, both a full
Discovery of the Countrey came to be made, and a large gap open’d to the
free possession thereof; yet in regard of the many disappointments and
misfortunes the several Companies sent over met with, and counting the
vast Charges their setting forth cost the Undertakers, which would have
been still increas’d by the need of continu’d Supplies, in all
probability _New England_ would have been but thinly peopled to this
day, had not a great Tide of People, possess’d with an aversion to the
Church-Government of _England_, and fled into _Holland_ for _Liberty of
Conscience_, eagerly taken hold of this opportunity to make themselves
Masters of their own Opinions, and of a Place where they might erect a
Government suitable thereunto: and though at first there were some
Exceptions taken, as if this Countrey was to be made a Receptacle of
Sectaries, and such as condemn’d the Ecclesiastical Government of the
Nation, insomuch that Sir _Ferdinando Gorges_, to whom they apply’d
themselves, desiring him to mediate for them to the Council of _New
Englands_ Affairs, when they perceiv’d the Authority they had from the
_Virginia_ Company, could not warrant their abode there, had enough to
do (notwithstanding his Apology, _That these things hapned contrary to
his expectation_) to wipe away the jealousie which was entertain’d of
him, it being Order’d, that no more should be suffer’d to pass into _New
England_, but such as should take the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy:
yet at last there was little notice taken who went, perhaps upon
consideration, that the vast resort of People thither would be of
greater advantage to the Plantations, than their different Opinions, at
so remote a distance, could be prejudicial, so long as they acknowledg’d
Obedience to the King and Civil Power: However, Sir _Ferdinando_, to
clear himself the better, mov’d those Lords that were the chief Actors
in the Business, to resign their Grand Patent to the King, and pass
particular Patents to themselves of such part of the Countrey along the
Sea-Coast, as might be sufficient for them: To this Motion there being a
general Assent given by the Lords, and a Day appointed for the
conclusion thereof, an Act was made for the Resignation of the Patent,
alloting to each Man their several Bounds. From the uttermost parts
began the Limits of the Lord _Mougrave_, and ended at _Hudson_’s
_River_. To the Eastward of which River, for the space of sixty Miles in
length, was placed the Duke of _Richmond_’s Assignment: Next to him was
setled the Earl of _Carlile_: Next him the Lord _Edward Gorges_: Next
the Marquess of _Hamilton_: Then Captain _John Mason_: And lastly his
own, which extended to the great River _Sagadehoc_, being sixty Miles,
and so up into the Main Land a hundred and twenty Miles, which he was
pleas’d to call by the Name of _The Province of Main_.

The Landing of the _English_ in _Plymouth_ Plantation was very much
facilitated by the great Mortality that hapned amongst the _Indians_
about that time, amongst the _Pecods_, _Narragansets_, _Nianticks_,
_Tarantines_, _Wippanaps_, and those of _Abargini_, _Agissawang_, and
_Pockanekie_, their _Powwows_, or Doctors, seeing with amazement their
_Wigwams_, or Streets, lie full of dead Bodies, and in vain expecting
help from _Squantam_ their good, or _Abbamoch_ their bad God. Not long
before, that blazing Comet, so much talk’d of in _Europe_, apppear’d
after Sun-setting in their Horizon South-West for the space of thirty
Sleeps, (for so they reckon their Days). They Landed at first with
little or no resistance, a handful of Men onely being sent before to
keep possession for their Companions, who arriv’d eight days after; when
the Natives appearing with their Bowes and Arrows, let flie their long
Shafts amongst them; whereupon one Captain _Miles Standish_ with his
Fowling-piece shot the stoutest _Sachem_ amongst the _Indians_, as he
was reaching an Arrow from his Quiver; which the rest seeing, fled into
the Woods and Thickets.

The same Year the _Merchant-Adventurers_ in _England_ sent forth store
of Servants to provide against the Wants of that place; amongst whom
came over a mix’d Multitude, who setled themselves in the Bosom of the
Cape now call’d _Gloucester_.

About the Year 1631. there fled to the _English_ at _Water-town_ the
_Indians_ that dwelt thereabouts, for protection against the
_Tarratines_, a sort of cruel and salvage Cannibals, by whom near the
Town of _Saugust_, in the very dead time of the Night, one Lieutenant
_Walker_ being on a sudden alarm’d, was shot through his Coat and Buff
Jacket with two Indian Arrows. That Night the _English_ stood upon their
Guard, and the next Morning sent word to other parts; who gather’d
together, and taking counsel how to quit themselves of these _Indians_,
agreed to discharge their great Guns; whose redoubled noise, ratling in
the Rocks, struck terror into the _Indians_, and caus’d them to betake
themselves to flight. The Autumn following, others of the _Indians_, who
till then had held a good correspondence with the Planters, began to
quarrel about the Bounds of their Land; but a great Mortality, by the
raging of the Small-Pox, breaking out amongst them, put an end to that
Controversie: There died amongst the rest one of the chief of the
_Sagamores_ of the _Mattachusets_, call’d _Sagamore John_, who before
his Death had been instructed in the _Christian_ Faith, and took care
that his two Sons should be nurtured therein.

In the Year 1635. there arrived several Ships with great plenty of
Provisions, and many Persons of good Quality, and amongst the rest Sir
_Henry Vane_.

The same Year the People of _Cambridge_, otherwise call’d _New-town_,
hearing of a fertile place upon the River _Canectico_, remov’d thither,
and erected a new Corporation by the Name of _Banectico_, being
encourag’d thereunto by the Lord _Say_ and the Lord _Brooks_, and
planting a Forrest at the mouth of the River, call’d it _Saybrook
Forrest_.

About the Year 1638. the _Pequods_, a stout and Warlike Nation, lying to
the South-West of the _Mattachusets_, were discover’d upon their March
within some few Miles of _Hartford_: Their coming very much terrifi’d
all that inhabited thereabouts; but they took onely three Women and
return’d; one of whom making a violent resistance, had her Brains beaten
out; the other two they carried away with them, without abusing their
Persons, as it was suppos’d they would, for they esteem’d their own
_Shaws_, being black, beyond our Women. Their chief Design was to learn
to make Gunpowder; which seeing they could not effect, they look’d upon
their Prize as nothing so precious as they imagin’d.

A little after another _Indian_ War threatning the _English_, they
resolv’d together to send an Ambassador to _Cannonicus_, chief _Sachem_
of the _Naragansits_, endeavoring to prevent him from confederating with
the _Pequods_, who (as they had Intelligence) were about sending to him
to joyn with them: _Cannonicus_ being grown old, had resign’d the
Government to his Nephew _Mantinemo_, a stern Man, and of a cruel
Nature. The Ambassadors arriving at his Court, which was about eighty
Miles from _Boston_, the _Indian_ Prince assembled his chief
Councellors, and having Entertain’d the Ambassadors Magnificently, and
Feasted them Royally, gave them Audience in his State-house; where the
_Sachem_, to manifest his greater State, lay along upon the Ground, with
all his Nobility sitting about him, with their Legs doubled up, and
their Knees touching their Chin: The _English_ Interpreter having made
his Speech in the Name of the rest, both _Cannonicus_ and the young King
gave discreet Answers, signifying their Resolutions to keep a fair
Correspondence with the _English_, and yet not to fall out with the
_Pequods_: Who a little after making also their Addresses to the same
King, he disswaded them by many Reasons from making War with the
_English_, and to deliver into their hands those Persons that had
murther’d any of them. The _Pequods_ nevertheless, though they seem’d
inclinable to his Counsel, yet they acted as Enemies; for when the
_English_ sent a Company of Soldiers into their Countrey to treat with
them about delivering up the Murtherers, they made shew of willingness,
but spying their advantage, betook themselves to their Heels; and
whomsoever they took stragling by surprise, they revil’d and insulted
over in a most cruel manner, vilifying the _Christian_ Religion, and
uttering all the Blasphemies they could invent. Whereupon they rais’d
fresh Souldiers for the War, to the number of fourscore, out of the
several Towns in the _Mattachusets_, and with some _Indian_ Guides came
to their Fort, within which they had pitch’d their _Wigwams_, the
Entrance being on two sides, with intricate Meanders to enter; at which
were plac’d _Indian_ Bowe-men, who shot the foremost of the _English_;
yet they had little to boast of in the end, for the _English_ rushing in
through the winding Ways, and placing themselves round the _Wigwams_,
made a very prosperous Shot, by directing the Muzzles of their Musquets
against the _Indians_ which lay sleeping on the Ground: In the midst of
which rouzing terror and confusion they were defeated with little ado,
most of them being either wounded, kill’d, or taken. The _English_ thus
animated with the first Victory, send their Prisoners to the Pinnaces,
and prosecute the War in Hand, marching against the next Body of the
_Indians_, which lay Encamp’d on a Hill about two Miles distant, where
they gave them a second Overthrow, slaying many more than in the first
Engagement; the rest flying to a very thick inaccessible Swamp or Bog,
were there besieg’d by the _English_; and skulking up and down, as they
saw their opportunity they would Shoot at them with their Arrows, and
then suddenly fall flat along in the Water; at last the _English_
finding out a Passage into the Swamp, utterly defeated them, and put an
end to the War with the loss of few Mens Lives, and not many wounded.

In the Year 1640. there came over a fresh Supply of People into _New
England_, and finding no place to settle in within any of the former
erected Colonies, they repair’d to a place call’d _Long Island_, sever’d
from the Continent of _New-Haven_, about sixty Miles off the Sea.

The Year following the four Colonies, namely the _Massachusets_,
_Plymouth_, _Canectico_, and _New-Haven_, taking into consideration the
many Nations that were on all sides of them, as the _French_, _Dutch_,
_Jews_, and native _Indians_; as also how the three first went to lay
claim to Lands they never had any right to, and the last to be
continually quarrelling and contending, where they saw any hopes of
prevailing, by Commissioners chosen from the respective Colonies,
concluded a firm Confederation to assist each other in all just and
lawful Wars; upon which there came in certain _Indian Sachems_, as
_Pomham_, _Miantonemo_, _Soccanocoh_, and _Uncas_, who not onely
submitted to the _English_ Government, but also, if occasion were, in
matters of Controversie submitted to their Arbitration: But the Contest
between _Miantonemo_ and _Uncas_ was too hot to be appeas’d, (though the
_English_ were not wanting to interpose) unless by the Blood of one of
them, as will appear by the Consequence: _Uncas_ was a Prince of _For_,
whose Life _Miantonemo_, though a much more potent Prince, sought to
take away by treachery, hiring a young Man of the _Pequod_ Nation to
murther him, as the following Story renders suspected; for one dark
Evening this _Sachem_ passing from one _Wigwam_ to another, was Shot
through the Arm with an Arrow; but recovering the Palace, had the Arrow
pull’d out, and his Arm cur’d: the young Man that was suspected being
examin’d, how he came by that great store of _Wampompeage_ which was
found about him, and being able to give no good account, it increas’d
the suspicion, and induc’d _Uncas_ to complain to the _English_ at a
General Court held at _Boston_: Whereupon the young Man was Examin’d in
the presence of _Miantonemo_, who came thither with his Attendants; but
the young Man tutor’d, as suppos’d, by _Miantonemo_, pretended that
_Uncas_ had enjoyn’d him to feign that he was hir’d by _Miantonemo_ to
kill him: To which Tale of his little belief being given, it was
concluded upon farther Examination of him in private that he had done
the Fact: nevertheless they let him depart with _Miantonemo_, advising
him to send him home to _Uncas_; but he in stead of returning him cut
off his Head, and forthwith gather’d an Army of a thousand Men to fight
with _Uncas_; who met him with half the Men: the Battel being joyn’d,
the _Narragansets_, though the far greater multitude, were beaten by the
_Wawhiggins_, through the Valour of _Uncas_ their Prince; who perfected
his Victory by possessing himself of the Person of _Miantonemo_, whom,
having put his Life-guard to flight, he carried away with him in triumph
to the Town of _Hartford_, desiring to have the advice of the United
Colonies what to do with his Prisoner: Whereupon the Commissioners
having had sufficient proof of _Miantonemo_’s treachery towards this
Prince, advis’d _Uncas_ to put him to death, but not to exercise that
barbarous kind of cruelty which is usual amongst them in these Cases.
The _Sachem_, upon this advice, not long after pretended to remove him
to a safer place, but by the Way caus’d him to be Executed: His Subjects
and Kindred were troubled at his Death, but the little Princes his
Neighbors, over whom he had tyranniz’d, rather rejoyc’d.

In the Year 1645, the Sons of old _Canonnicus_, their Father being dead,
began to fall into hot Contentions with their Neighbors, and being
forbidden by the United Colonies, they did not stick to threaten Wars to
the _English_ also. Whereupon the Commissioners rais’d an Army of Horse
and Foot, and made Major General _Edward Gibbons_ Commander in Chief
over them. But the _Indians_ hearing of this Preparation, sent some of
their chief Nobility to the Commissioners of the United Colonies, who
were assembled at _Boston_, to Treat about Peace; to which the
Commissioners agreed, upon condition they should pay a part of the
Charges of the War; and that they should send four of their Sons for
Hostages till the Sum was paid; and the Hostages being sent back before
the _Wapom_ was all paid, the two Princes, _Pesicus_ and _Mexanimo_,
upon the sending a Company of Armed Men to demand it, sent the remainder
of the Money.

In the Year 1647. divers Persons of Quality ventur’d their Estates upon
an Iron Mill, which they began at _Braintree_, but it profited the
Owners little, rather wasting their Stock, the price of Labor in matters
of that nature, being double or treble to what it is in _England_.

These are the most material Transactions we find deliver’d by any one
which hapned from the first discovery till the Year before mention’d:
what hath hapned from that time to this, chiefly relates to the several
Revolutions that have been in _England_, and shall be therefore taken
notice of when we come to speak of the Government of these Plantations.

[Sidenote: The Commodities of this Countrey, together with the Trees and
           other sorts of Plants.]

Though there are, who having remain’d some time, and been concern’d in
those Parts, affirm the Soil of _New England_ to be nothing so fruitful
as it is believ’d and commonly deliver’d to be, yet we think it not
improper to give a brief account of the Trees and other Plants; also the
Beasts, Birds, Fishes, and other Commodities which most Writers will
have to be the production of this Countrey, especially since we find
them compactly summ’d up by an unknown Writer in the Language of the
_Muses_. The recital of the Plants and Trees, which (excepting the
Cedar, _Sassafras_, and Dyers _Sumach_) are all of the same kind with
those that grow in _Europe_, onely differing in nature, according as the
Epithets of many of them declare, is as follows:

         _Trees both in Hills and Plains in plenty be;
         The long-liv’d Oak, and mournful Cypress Tree;
         Skie-towring Pines, and Chesnuts coated rough;
         The lasting Cedar, with the Walnut tough;
         The Rozen-dropping Fir, for Mast in use;
         The Boat-men seek for Oars light, neat grown Sprewse;
         The brittle Ash, the ever-trembling Asps;
         The broad-spread Elm, whose Concave harbors Wasps;
         The Water-spungy Alder, good for nought;
         Small Eldern by the_ Indian _Fletchers sought;
         The knotty Maple, pallid Birch, Hawthorns;
         The Horn-bound Tree, that to be cloven scorns;
         Which from the tender Vine oft takes his Spouse,
         Who twines embracing Arms about his Boughs.
         Within this_ Indian _Orchard Fruits be some;
         The ruddy Cherry, and the jetty Plumb;
         Snake-murthering Hazle, with sweet Saxafrage,
         Whose Leaves in Beer allay hot Feavers rage;
         The Dyers Shumach, with more Trees there be,
         That are both good to use, and rare to see_.

[Sidenote: Beasts.]

The Beasts peculiar to this Countrey are the _Moose_, the _Rackoon_, and
the _Musquash_; the two first Land-Animals, the last Amphibious, which
with others common to them with us, are thus versifi’d by the abovesaid
Author:

           _The Kingly Lyon, and the strong-arm’d Bear;
           The large limb’d Mooses, with the tripping Deer;
           Quill-darting Porcupines, that Rackoons be
           Castled ith’ hollow of an aged Tree;
           The skipping Squirrel, Rabbet, purblind Hare,
           Immured in the self-same Castle are,
           Lest red-ey’d Ferrets, wily Foxes should,
           Them undermine, if Ramper’d but with Mold;
           The grim-fac’d Ounce, and rav’nous howling Wolf,
           Whose meagre Paunch sucks like a swallowing Gulph;
           Black glittering Otters, and rich Coated Beaver;
           The Civet-scented Musquash smelling ever._

Of such of these as are altogether unknown to us, take these brief
Descriptions.

[Sidenote: The _Moose_.]

The Beast call’d a _Moose_, is not much unlike red Deer, and is as big
as an Ox, slow of Foot, Headed like a Buck, with a broad Beam, some
being two Yards wide in the Head, their flesh is as good as Beef, their
Hides good for Clothing; if these were kept tame, and accustom’d to the
Yoke, they would be a great Commodity: First, because they are so
fruitful, bringing forth three at a time being likewise very uberous:
Secondly, because they will live in Winter without any Fodder. There are
not many of these in the _Massachusets_ Bay, but forty Miles to the
North-East there are great store of them.

[Sidenote: The _Rackoon_.]

The _Rackoon_ is a deep Furr’d Beast, not much unlike a Badger, having a
Tail like a Fox, as good Meat as a Lamb: These Beasts in the day time
sleep in hollow Trees, in a Moon-shine night they go to feed on Clams at
a low Tide, by the Sea side, where the _English_ hunt them with their
Dogs.

[Sidenote: The _Musquash_.]

The _Musquash_ is much like a Beaver for shape, but nothing near so big;
the Male hath two Stones, which smell as sweet as Musk, and being kill’d
in Winter, never lose their sweet smell: These Skins are no bigger than
a Coney-skin, yet are sold for five Shillings apiece, being sent for
Tokens into _England_; one good Skin will perfume a whole house full of
Clothes, if it be right and good.

[Sidenote: Birds.]

The Birds both common and peculiar are thus recited.

         _The Princely Eagle, and the soaring Hawk,
         Whom in their unknown ways there’s none can chawk:
         The Humbird for some Queens rich Cage more fit,
         Than in the vacant Wilderness to sit.
         The swift-wing’d Swallow sweeping to and fro,
         As swift as Arrow from_ Tartarian _Bowe.
         When as_ Aurora’s _Infant day new springs,
         There th’morning mounting Lark her sweet lays sings.
         The harmonious Thrush, swift Pigeon, Turtle-dove,
         Who to her Mate doth ever constant prove:
         The_ Turky-_Pheasant, Heath-cock, Partridge rare,
         The Carrion-tearing Crow, and hurtful Stare,
         The long-liv’d Raven, th’ominous Screech-Owl,
         Who tells, as old Wives say, disasters foul.
         The drowsie Madge that leaves her day-lov’d Nest,
         And loves to rove, when Day-birds be at rest:
         Th’Eel-murthering Hearn, and greedy Cormorant,
         That near the Creeks in morish Marshes haunt.
         The bellowing Bittern, with the long-leg’d Crane,
         Presaging Winters hard, and dearth of Grain.
         The Silver Swan that tunes her mournful breath,
         To sing the Dirge of her approaching death.
         The tattering Oldwives, and the cackling Geese,
         The fearful Gull that shuns the murthering Peece.
         The strong-wing’d Mallard, with the nimble Teal,
         And ill-shape’t Loon, who his harsh Notes doth squeal.
         There Widgins, Sheldrakes and Humilitees,
         Snites, Doppers, Sea-Larks, in whole million flees._

Of these the _Humbird_, _Loon_, and _Humility_ are not to be pass’d by
without particular observation.

[Sidenote: The _Humbird_.]

The _Humbird_ is one of the wonders of the Countrey, being no bigger
than a Hornet, yet hath all the Dimensions of a Bird, as Bill, and Wings
with Quills, Spider-like Legs, small Claws: for Colour, she is as
glorious as the Rain-bow; as she flies, she makes a little humming noise
like a Humble-bee, wherefore she is call’d the _Humbird_.

[Sidenote: The _Loon_.]

[Sidenote: The _Humility_, or _Simplicity_.]

The _Loon_ is an ill-shap’d thing like a Cormorant, but that he can
neither go nor flie; he maketh a noise sometimes like Sowgelders Horn.
The _Humilities_ or _Simplicities_ (as we may rather call them) are of
two sorts, the biggest being as large as a green Plover; the other as
big as Birds we call _Knots_ in _England_. Such is the simplicity of the
smaller sorts of these Birds, that one may drive them on a heap like so
many Sheep, and seeing a fit time shoot them; the living seeing the
dead, settle themselves on the same place again, amongst which the
Fowler discharges again: These Birds are to be had upon Sandy Brakes, at
the latter end of Summer before the Geese come in.

[Sidenote: Fishes.]

No less Poetical a Bill of Fare is brought of the Fish on the
Sea-Coasts, and in the Rivers of _New England_ in these subsequent
Verses.

           _The King of Waters, the Sea shouldering Whale,
           The snuffing Grampus, with the Oily Seale,
           The storm presaging Porpus, Herring-Hog,
           Line-shearing Shark, the Catfish and Sea Dog,
           The Scale-fenc’d Sturgeon, wry-mouth’d Hollibut,
           The flounsing Salmon, Codfish, Greedigut:
           Cole, Haddock, Hage, the Thornback, and the Scate,
           Whose slimy outside makes him seld in date,
           The stately Bass, old_ Neptune’s _fleeting Post,
           That Tides it out and in from Sea to Coast.
           Consorting Herrings, and the bonny Shad,
           Big-belly’d Alewives, Mackrills richly clad
           With Rainbow colours, Frostfish and the Smelt,
           As good as ever Lady_ Gustus _felt.
           The spotted Lamprons, Eels, the Lamperies,
           That seek fresh Water-Brooks with_ Argus _Eyes,
           These watery Villagers, with thousands more,
           Do pass and repass near the Verdant Shore_.


                   Kinds of Shell-fish.

           _The luscious Lobster, with the Crabfish raw,
           The brinish Oyster, Muscle, Periwigge,
           And Tortoise sought for by the_ Indian _Sqaw,
           Which to the Flats dance many a Winters Jigge,
           To dive for Cocles, and to dig for Clams,
           Whereby her lazie Husbands guts she crams_.

[Sidenote: The _Seal_.]

To speak of the most unusual of these sorts of Fish; First the _Seal_,
which is call’d the _Sea-Calf_, his Skin is good for divers uses, his
Body being between Flesh and Fish, it is not very delectable to the
Palate, or congruent with the Stomack; his Oil is very good to burn in
Lamps, of which he affords a great deal.

[Sidenote: The _Shark_.]

The _Shark_ is a kind of Fish as big as a Man, some as big as a Horse,
with three rows of Teeth within his Mouth, with which he snaps asunder
the Fishermans Lines, if he be not very circumspect: This Fish will leap
at a Mans hand if it be over board, and with his Teeth snap off a Mans
Leg or Hand if he be Swimming; these are often taken, being good for
nothing but Manuring of Land.

[Sidenote: The _Hollibut_.]

The _Hollibut_ is not much unlike a Pleace or Turbut, some being two
yards long, and one wide, a Foot thick; the plenty of better Fish makes
these of little esteem, except the Head and Finns, which Stew’d or Bak’d
is very good; these _Hollibuts_ be little set by while _Basse_ is in
season.

[Sidenote: The _Basse_.]

The _Basse_ is one of the best Fishes in the Countrey, and though Men
are soon weary’d with other Fish, yet are they never with _Basse_; it is
a delicate, fine, fat, fast Fish, having a Bone in his Head which
contains a Sawcerful of Marrow, sweet and good, pleasant to the Palate,
and wholsom to the Stomack: When there be great store of them, we only
eat the Heads, and Salt up the Bodies for Winter, which exceeds Ling or
Haberdine: Of these Fishes some are three, and some four Foot long, some
bigger, some lesser; at some Tides a Man may catch a dozen or twenty of
these in three hours; the way to catch them is with Hook and Line: The
Fisherman taking a great Cod-line, to which he fasteneth a piece of
Lobster, throws it into the Sea, the Fish biting at it, he pulls her to
him, and knocks her on the head with a Stick.

[Sidenote: _Alewives._]

_Alewives_ are a kind of Fish which is much like a Herring, which in the
later end of _April_ come up to the fresh Rivers to Spawn, in such
multitudes as is almost incredible, pressing up in such shallow Waters
as will scarce permit them to Swim, having likewise such longing desire
after the fresh Water Ponds, that no beatings with Poles, or forcive
agitations by other devices, will cause them to return to the Sea, till
they have cast their Spawn.

[Sidenote: _Clamms_ or _Clamps_.]

_Clamms_ or _Clamps_, are a Shell-fish not much unlike a Cockle, they
lie under the Sand and have every one of them a round hole to take Air,
and receive Water at. When the Tide ebbs and flows, a Man running over
these _Clamm_ banks will presently be made all wet, by their spouting of
Water out of those small holes: These Fishes are in great plenty in most
places of the Countrey, which is a great Commodity for the feeding of
Swine, both in Winter and Summer; for being once us’d to those places,
they will repair to them as duly every Ebb, as if they were driven to
them by Keepers: In some places of the Countrey there be _Clamms_ as big
as a Peny white Loaf, which are great Dainties amongst the Natives, and
would be in great esteem amongst the _English_, were it not for better
Fish.

Other Commodities which this Countrey is said to yield, are, in
down-right Prose, Furrs, Flax, Linnen, Iron, Pitch, Masts, Cables, and
some quantity of Amber; so that if what many Authors have consented to
assert concerning _New England_ be not a meer Fiction, what e’re hath
been affirm’d of the unfruitfulness of the Country will demonstrably be
found invalid.

[Sidenote: Noxious Creatures.]

There are also to be found here some hurtful Creatures, of which, that
which is most injurious to the Person and Life of a Man is the
_Rattle-Snake_, which is generally a yard and a half long, as thick in
the middle as the small of a Mans Leg; she hath a yellow Belly, her Back
being spotted with black, russet, yellow, and green colours, plac’d like
Scales; at her Tail is a Rattle, with which she makes a noise when she
is molested, or when she seeth any approach near her; her Neck seems to
be no thicker than a Mans Thumb, yet she can swallow a Squirril, having
a great wide Mouth, with Teeth as sharp as Needles, wherewith she biteth
such as tread upon her, her Poyson lyeth in her Teeth, for she hath no
Sting. When any Man is bitten by any of these Creatures, the Poyson
spreads so suddenly through the Veins, and so runs to the Heart, that in
one hour it causeth Death, unless he hath the Antidote to expel the
Poyson, which is a Root call’d _Snake-weed_, which must be champ’d, the
Spittle swallow’d, and the Root apply’d to the Sore; this is present
Cure against that which would be present death without it: This Weed is
rank Poyson, if it be taken by any man that is not bitten; whosoever is
bitten by these Snakes, his flesh becomes as spotted as a Leopard, until
he be perfectly cur’d. It is reported, that if the Party live that is
bitten, the Snake will die, and if the Party die, the Snake will live.
This is a most Poysonous and dangerous Animal, yet nothing so bad as the
report goes of it in _England_; for whereas it is said to kill a Man
with its breath, and that it can flie, there is no such matter, for it
is naturally the most sleepy and unnimble Creature that lives, never
offering to leap or bite any Man, if it be not trodden on first; and it
is their desire in hot weather to lie in Paths, where the Sun may shine
on them, where they will sleep so soundly, that I have known four Men
stride over one of them, and never awake it; five or six Men have been
bitten by them, which by using of _Snake-weed_ were all cur’d, never any
yet losing his life by them. Cows have been bitten, but being cut in
divers places, and this Weed thrust into their flesh, were cur’d; A
small Switch will easily kill one of these Snakes. In many places of the
Country there be none of them, as at _Plymouth, New-town, Igowamme,
Nahant, &c._ In some places they will live on one side of the River, and
swimming but over the Water, as soon as they are come into the Woods,
they turn up their yellow Bellies and die. Up into the Countrey,
Westward from the Plantations, is a high Hill, which is call’d
_Rattle-Snake-Hill_, where there are great store of these Poysonous
Creatures.

There are likewise troublesome Flies.

First there is a wild Bee or Wasp, which commonly guards the Grape,
building by Cobweb habitation amongst the Leaves: Secondly a great green
Flie, not much unlike our Horse-Flies in _England_; they will nipp so
sore, that they will fetch Blood either of Man or Beast, and are most
troublesome where most Cattel are, which brings them from out of the
Woods to the Houses; this Flie continues but for the Moneth of _June_.
The third is _Gurnipper_, which is a small black Flie, no bigger than a
Flea; her biting causeth an itching upon the Hands or Face, which
provoketh scratching, which is troublesome to some; this Flie is busie
but in close Mornings or Evenings, and continues not above three Weeks;
the least Wind or heat expels them. The fourth is a _Musketor_, which is
not unlike to our Gnats in _England_; in places where there is no thick
Woods or _Swamps_, there are none or very few. In the new Plantations
they are troublesome for the first year, but the Wood decaying they
vanish: These Flies cannot endure Wind, heat or cold, so that these are
only troublesome in close thick Weather, and against Rain, many that are
bitten will fall a scratching, whereupon their Faces and Hands swell.

[Sidenote: The nature of the ancient Inhabitants.]

As touching the Nature of the ancient Inhabitants, they are to be
consider’d according to their several Shires or Divisions; those that
inhabit to the East and North-East bore the name of _Churchers_ and
_Tarrenteens_; those in the Southern parts were call’d _Pequods_, and
_Narragansets_; those Westward, _Connectacuts_ and _Mowhacks_; to the
North-West, of whom were the _Aberginians_.

[Sidenote: The nature of the _Mowhacks_.]

The _Mowhacks_ were ever accounted a cruel bloudy People, which were
wont to come down upon their poor Neighbors, with more than bruitish
Savageness, spoiling their Corn, burning their Houses, slaying Men,
ravishing Women, yea very _Canibals_ they were, sometimes eating on a
Man one part after another before his Face, and while yet living;
insomuch, that the very Name of a _Mowhack_ would strike the Heart of a
poor _Aberginian_ dead, till they had the _English_ on their sides to
succor them; for these inhumane Homicides confess that they dare not
meddle with a white Fac’d Man, accompany’d with his hot-mouth’d Weapon.

These _Indians_ are a People of tall Stature, long grim Visages, slender
Wasted, and having exceeding great Arms and Thighs, wherein they say
their strength lieth; which is such, that one of them hath been known to
kill a Dog with a fillip of his Finger, and afterwards to have flead and
sod him, and eat him to his Dinner. They are so hardy, that they can eat
such things as would make other _Indians_ sick to look upon; being
destitute of Fish and Flesh, they suffice Hunger and maintain Nature
with the use of Vegetatives; but that which they most hunt after, is the
flesh of Man: Their custom is, if they get a stranger near their
Habitations, not to Butcher him immediately, but keep him in as good
plight as they can, feeding him with the best Victuals they have.

These _Indians_ are more desperate in Wars than the other _Indians_,
which proceeds not only from the fierceness of their Natures, but also
in that they know themselves to be better Arm’d and Weapon’d; all of
them wearing Sea Horse Skins and Barks of Trees, made by their Art as
impenetrable, it is thought, as Steel, wearing Head-Pieces of the same,
under which they March securely and undantedly, running, and fiercely
crying out, _Hadree Hadree succomee succomee_, _We come to suck your
Blood_, not fearing the feather’d shafts of the strong-arm’d Bow-men,
but like unruly headstrong Stallions, beat them down with their
right-hand _Tamahawks_, and left-hand Javelins, being all the Weapons
which they use, counting Bowes a cowardly fight. _Tamahawks_ are Staves
of two Foot and a half long, with knobs at one end as round and big as a
Foot ball; a Javelin is a short Spear, headed with sharp Sea-Horse
Teeth; one blow or thrust with these sharp Weapons, will not need a
second to hasten death from a _Mowhacks_ arm.

[Sidenote: The nature of the _Indians_ inhabiting Eastward.]

The _Tarrenteens_ saving that they eat not Mans flesh, are little less
Salvage and cruel than these _Cannibals_; our _Indians_ do fear them as
their deadly Enemies, for so many of them as they meet, they kill. Take
these _Indians_ in their own proper and natural disposition, and they
are reported to be wise, lofty-spirited, constant in friendship to one
another, true in their promise, and more industrious than many others.

[Sidenote: The nature of the _Pequods_ and _Narragansets_.]

The _Pequants_ are a stately Warlike People, just and equal in their
dealings; not treacherous either to their Country-men, or _English_, to
whom (except in time of War) they were not any ways uncivil. Their next
Neighbors the _Narragansets_, are the most numerous People in those
Parts, the most rich also, and the most industrious; being the
Store-house of all such kind of wild Merchandize as is amongst them.
These Men are the most curious Minters of their _Wampompeage_ and
_Mowhakes_, which they form out of the inmost Wreaths of
Periwinkle-shells. The Northern, Eastern, and Western _Indians_ fetch
all their Coyn from these Southern Mint-Masters. From hence they have
most of their curious Pendants and Bracelets, from hence they have their
great Stone Pipes, which will hold a quarter of an Ounce of Tobacco,
which they make with Steel Drills and other Instruments; such is their
Ingenuity and dexterity, that they can imitate the _English_ Mold so
accurately, that were it not for matter and colour, it were hard to
distinguish them; they make them of green, and sometimes of black Stone;
they are much desir’d of our _English_ Tobacconists, for their rarity,
strength, handsomness, and coolness. Hence likewise our _Indians_ had
their Pots, wherein they us’d to seeth their Victuals before they knew
the use of Brass. Since the _English_ came, they have employ’d most of
their time in catching of Beavers, Otters, and _Musquashes_, which they
bring down into the Bay, returning back loaden with _English_
Commodities, of which they make double profit, by selling them to more
remote _Indians_, who are ignorant at what cheap rates they obtain them,
in comparison of what they make them pay, so making their Neighbors
ignorance their enrichment: They were never known to be desirous to take
in hand any Martial Enterprize, or expose themselves to the uncertain
events of War; wherefore the _Pequants_ call them _Women-like Men_,
resting secure under the conceit of their popularity, and seeking rather
to grow rich by industry, than famous by deeds of Chivalry.

[Sidenote: The nature and complexion of the _Aberginians_.]

Most of these Northward _Indians_ are between five and six Foot high,
straight Body’d, strongly compos’d, smooth Skin’d, merry Countenanc’d,
of Complexion more swarthy than the _Spaniards_, black Hair’d, high
Foreheaded, black Ey’d, out-Nos’d, broad Shoulder’d, brawny Arm’d, long
and slender Handed, out Breasted, small Wasted, lank Belly’d, well
Thigh’d, flat Kneed, with handsome grown Legs, and small Feet: In a
word, take them when the Blood skips in their Veins, when the Flesh is
on their Backs, and Marrow in their Bones, when they frolick in their
antique Deportments and _Indian_ Postures, they are more amiable to
behold (though onely in _Adam_’s Livery) than many a trim Gallant in the
newest Mode; and though their Houses are but mean, their Lodging as
homely, Commons scant, their Drink Water, and Nature their best
Clothing, yet they still are healthful and lusty. Their smooth Skins
proceed from the often anointing of their Bodies with the Oyl of Fishes,
and the fat of Eagles, with the grease of _Rackoons_, which they hold in
Summer the best Antidote to keep their Skin from blistering with the
scorching Sun; it is their best Armor against the _Musketoes_, and the
surest abrasour of the hairy Excrement, and stops the Pores of their
Bodies against the nipping Winters cold. Their black Hair is natural,
yet is brought to a more Jetty colour by Oyling, Dying, and daily
dressing; sometimes they wear it very long, hanging down in a loose
dishevel’d Womanish manner, otherwise ty’d up hard and short like a
Horse Tail, bound close with a Fillet, which they say makes it grow the
faster; they are not a little Phantastical in this particular; their
Boys being not permitted to wear their Hair long till sixteen years of
Age, and then they must come to it by degrees; some being cut with a
long foretop, a long lock on the Crown, one of each side of his Head,
the rest of his Hair being cut even with the Scalp; the young Men and
Soldiers wear their Hair long on the one side, the other being cut short
like a Screw; other cuts they have as their Fancy leads them, which
would torture the Wits of the most exact Barber to imitate. But though
they are thus proud of the Hair of their Head, you cannot wooe them to
wear it on their Chins, where it no sooner grows, but it is stubb’d up
by the roots, for they count it as an unuseful, cumbersome, and
opprobrious excrement, insomuch as they call him an _English_ Mans
Bastard that hath but the appearance of a Beard.

[Sidenote: The Apparel, Ornaments, Paintings, and other artificial
           Deckings of the _Indians_.]

The Cloathing of the _Indians_ is only a pair of _Indian_ Breeches to
cover their secret Parts, which is but a piece of Cloth a yard and a
half long, but between their Groins, ty’d with a Snakes Skin about their
middles, one end hanging down with a flap before, the other like a tail
behind. In the Winter time, the more Aged of them wear Leather Drawers,
in form like _Irish_ Trouses, fasten’d under their Girdle with Buttons:
They wear Shooes likewise of their own making, cut out of a _Mooses_
Hide; many of them wear Skins about them, in form of an _Irish_ Mantle,
and of these some are Bears Skins, _Mooses_ Skins, and Beaver Skins
sew’d together, others Otter Skins, and _Rackoon_ Skins; most of them in
the Winter having his deep Furr’d Cat Skin, like a large Muff, which he
shifts to that Arm which lieth most expos’d to the Wind. Although they
are poor, yet is there in them the sparks of natural Pride, which
appears in their longing desire after many kind of Ornaments, wearing
Pendants in their Ears, in form of Birds, Beasts, and Fishes, Carv’d out
of Bone, Shells, and Stone, with long Bracelets of their curious wrought
_Wampompeage_ and _Mowhackees_, which they put about their Necks and
Loins; these they count a rare kind of Decking; many of the better sort
bearing upon their Cheeks certain Pourtraitures of Beasts, as Bears,
Deers, _Mooses_, Wolves, _&c._ some of Fowls, as of Eagles, Hawks, _&c._
which is not a superficial Painting, but a certain Incision, or else a
raising of their Skin by a small sharp Instrument, under which they
convey a certain kind of black unchangeable Ink, which makes the desir’d
form apparent and permanent. Others have certain round Impressions down
the outside of their Arms and Breasts, in form of Mullets or
Spur-rowels, which they imprint by searing Irons: Whether these be Foils
to illustrate their unparallel’d Beauty (as they deem it) or Arms to
blazon their antique Gentility, cannot easily be determin’d: But a
_Segamore_ with a _Humbird_ in his Ear for a Pendant, a black Hawk on
his Head for his Plume, _Mowhackees_ for his Gold Chain, good store of
_Wampompeage_ begirting his Loins, his Bowe in his Hand, his Quiver at
his Back, with six naked _Indian_ Lacquies at his Heels for his Guard,
thinks himself little Inferior to the great _Cham_.

[Sidenote: Their Diet, Cookery, Meal-times, and Hospitality at their
           Kettles.]

In Winter time they have all manner of Fowls and Beasts of the Land and
Water, Pond-fish, with _Cathaires_ and other Roots, _Indian_ Beans and
_Clamms_; in the Summer they have all manner of Sea-fish, with all sorts
of Berries. For the ordering of their Victuals, they Boil or Roast them,
having large Kettles which they Traded for with the _French_ long since,
and do still buy of the _English_ as their need requires, before they
had substantial Earthen Pots of their own making. Their Spits are no
other than cloven Sticks, sharpen’d at one end to thrust into the
ground; into these cloven Sticks they thrust the Flesh or Fish they
would have Roasted, behemming a round fire with a dozen of Spits at a
time, turning them as they see occasion. They seldom or never make Bread
of their _Indian_ Corn, but seethe it whole like Beans, eating three or
four Corns with a mouthful of Fish or Flesh, sometimes eating Meat
first, and Corns after, filling the Chinks with their Broth. In Summer,
when their Corn is spent, _Sqoutersquashes_ is their best Bread, a Fruit
like a young Pumpion: But as all are fellows at Foot-ball, so they all
meet Friends at the Kettle, saving their Wives, that Dance a
Spaniel-like attendance at their Backs for their Fragments. If their
occasions cause them to Travel, the best of their Victuals for their
Journey is _Nocake_, (as they call it) which is nothing but _Indian_
Corn parch’d in the hot Ashes; the Ashes being sifted from it, it is
afterwards beaten to Powder, and put into a long Leathern Bag, truss’d
at their Back like a Knapsack, out of which they take thrice three
Spoonfuls a day, dividing it into three Meals. If it be Winter, and Snow
be on the ground, they can eat when they please, making use of Snow for
their Drink; in Summer, they must stay till they meet with a Spring or
Brook; with this strange _viaticum_ they will travel four or five days
together. They keep no Set-Meals, their Store being spent, they champ on
the Bit, till they meet with fresh Supplies, either from their own
endeavors, or their Wives industry, who trudge to the _Clam-banks_ when
all other means fail. Though they are sometimes scanted, yet are they as
free as Emperors, both to their Countrey-men and _English_, be he
stranger, or near acquaintance; counting it a great discourtesie, not to
eat of their high-conceited Delicates.

[Sidenote: Of their hardiness.]

Their hardiness is much to be admir’d, no ordinary pains making them so
much as alter their countenance; beat them, whip them, punch them, if
they put on a resolution, they will not winch for it; whether it be
their benumm’d insensibleness of smart, or their hardy resolutions, is
hard to resolve; It might be a _Perillus_ his Bull, or the Rack might
force an out-cry from them, but a _Turkish_ drubbing would not move
them, the unexpected approach of a mortal Wound by a Bullet, Arrow, or
Sword, striking no more terror, nor causing no more exclamation in them,
than if it had been a shot into the body of a Tree; such Wounds as would
be sudden death to an _English_ Man, would be nothing to them; whether
it be, that by their rare skill in the use of Vegetatives, or by
Diabolical Charms, they cure them; nevertheless, the very name and
thoughts of death is so hideous to them, or any thing that presents it
so terrible, that a hundred of them will run from two or three arm’d
with Guns. In the Night they need not to be feared, for they will not
budge from their own Dwellings, for fear of their _Abamacho_ (the Devil)
whom they much fear, specially in evil enterprizes, they will rather lie
by an _English_ fire than go a quarter of a Mile in the dark to their
own Dwellings; but they are well freed from this Scare-crow since the
coming of the _English_, and less care for his delusions.

[Sidenote: Of their Kings, Government, and Subjects obedience.]

Now for the matter of Government amongst them; it is the custom of their
Kings to inherit, the Son always taking the Kingdom after his Fathers
death. If there be no Son, then the Queen rules; if no Queen, the next
to the Blood-Royal; who comes in otherwise, is but counted an usurping
Intruder, if his fair carriage bear him not out the better, they will
soon Unscepter him. Some say the chief _Powahe_ is next in Dignity and
Authority to the King, and when he dies, Marries the _Squasachem_, or
Queen.

The Kings have no Laws to Command by, nor have they any annual Revenues;
yet commonly are they so either fear’d or beloved, that half their
Subjects estate is at their Service, and their Persons at his Command,
by which Command he is better known than by any thing else; for though
he hath no Kingly Robes to make him glorious in the view of his
Subjects, nor daily Guards to succor his Person, nor Court-like
attendance, nor sumptuous Palaces; yet do they yield all submissive
subjection to him, accounting him their Soveraign; going at his Command,
and coming at his Beck, not so much as expostulating the cause, though
it be in matters thwarting their wills; he being accounted a disloyal
Subject that will not effect what his Prince Commands. Whosoever is
known to Plot Treason, or to lay violent hands on his lawful King, is
presently Executed. Once a Year he takes his Progress, accompanied with
a dozen of his best Subjects, to view his Countrey, to recreate himself,
and establish good Orders. When he enters into any of their Houses,
without any more Complement, he is desir’d to sit down on the Ground,
(for they use neither Stools nor Cushions) and after a little respite
all that are present come in, and sit down by him, one of his Seniors
pronouncing an Oration gratulatory to his Majesty for love, and the many
good things they enjoy under his peaceful Government. A King of large
Dominions hath his Vice-Roys, or inferior Kings under him, to agitate
his State Affairs, and keep his Subjects in good Decorum. Other Officers
there are, but how to distinguish them by Name is something difficult.
For their Laws, as their Vices come short of many other Nations, so they
have not so many Laws, though they are not without some, which they
inflict upon notorious Malefactors, as Traitors to their Prince,
inhumane Murtherers, and, some say, Adulterers: for Theft, as they have
nothing to steal worth the Life of a Man, therefore they have no Law to
Execute for Trivials, a Subject being more precious in the Eye of his
Prince, than, where Men are so scarce, to be cast away upon so sleight a
matter. A Malefactor having deserv’d Death, and being apprehended, is
brought before the King, and some other of the wisest Men, where they
enquire out the original of the thing, after proceeding by aggravation
of Circumstances he is found Guilty, and Cast by the Jury of their
strict Inquisition, he is Condemn’d and Executed in the following
manner: The Executioner comes in, who blind-folds the Party, sets him in
the publick view, and Brains him with a _Tamahauke_, or Club; which
done, his Friends bury him.

[Sidenote: Of their Marriages.]

Now to speak something of their Marriages, the Kings and the _Powwows_,
or great Doctors, may have two or three Wives, but seldom use it, Men of
ordinary Rank having but one; which disproves the report, that they had
eight or ten Wives apiece. When a Man hath a desire to Marry, he first
gets the good will of the Maid or Widow, after, the consent of her
Friends for her part; and for himself, if he be at his own disposing,
and if the King will, the Match is made, her Dowry of _Wampompeage_
paid, the _Sagamore_ or King (who for every Marriage hath a Fathom of
_Wampompeage_, which is about the value of seven or eight shillings)
joyns their Hands, never to part till Death, unless she prove a Whore,
for which they may put away their Wives.

[Sidenote: Of their Worship, Invocations, and Conjurations.]

As it is natural to all Mortals to worship something, so do these
People, but exactly to describe to whom their Worship is chiefly bent,
is very difficult: They acknowledge especially two, _Ketan_, some say
_Tantum_, their good God, and _Hobamocco_, some say _Squantum_, their
evil God; to _Ketan_ they Sacrifice (as the ancient _Heathens_ did to
_Ceres_) after their Garners be full with a good Crop. They likewise
Invocate this God for fair Weather, for Rain in time of Drought, and for
the recovery of their Sick; but if they do not hear them, then they
verrifie the old Verse, _Flectere si nequeo Superos Acheronta movebo_,
their _Powwows_ betaking themselves to their Exorcismes and Necromantick
Charms, by which they bring to pass strange things, if we may believe
the _Indians_, who report of one _Pissacannaw_, that he could make the
Water burn, the Rocks move, the Trees dance, and metamorphose himself
into a flaming Man. In Winter, when there is no green Leaves to be got,
he would out of the Ashes of an old Leaf, calcin’d and put into the
Water, produce a new green Leaf: And of a dead Snakes Skin, a living
Snake, both to be seen, felt and heard. The manner of their action in
their Conjuration is thus: The Parties that are sick or lame being
brought before them, the _Powwow_ sitting down, the rest of the Indians
giving attentive audience to his Imprecations and Invocations, and after
the violent expression of many a hideous bellowing and groaning he makes
a stop, and then all the Auditors with one voice utter a short _Canto_;
which done, the _Powwow_ still proceeds in his Invocations, sometimes
roaring like a Bear, other times groaning like a dying Horse, foaming at
the Mouth like a chased Boar, smiting on his naked Brest and Thighs with
such violence, as if he were mad: Thus will he continue sometimes half a
day, spending his Lungs, sweating out his Fat, and tormenting his Body
in this diabolical Worship. Sometimes the Devil, for requital of their
Worship, recovers the Party, to nuzzle them up in their devillish
Religion. But since the _English_ (upon whom, and in whose presence it
is said the _Powwows_ could never work their Witchcrafts) frequented
those Parts, they daily fall from his Colours, relinquishing their
former Fopperies, and acknowledge the Power of the _English_-man’s God,
as they call him. And it is reported of them, that at the very first
they were so tractable to the _Christian_ Religion, that they would say
King _James_ was good, and his God good, but their _Tanto_ nought,
though of their two Gods he was accounted the good one.

[Sidenote: Of their Wars.]

They use no other Weapons in War than Bowes and Arrows, saving that
their Captains have long Spears, on which, if they return Conquerors,
they carry the Heads of their chief Enemies that they slay in the Wars,
it being the Custom to cut off their Heads, Hands and Feet, to bear home
to their Wives and Children, as true tokens of their renowned Victory.
When they go to their Wars, it is their Custom to paint their Faces with
diversity of Colours, some being all black as Jet, some red, some half
red and half black, some black and white, others spotted with divers
kinds of Colours, being all disguis’d to their Enemies, to make them
more terrible to their Foes, putting on likewise their rich Jewels,
Pendents, and _Wampompeage_, to put them in mind that they Fight not
onely for their Children, Wives and Lives, but likewise for their Goods,
Lands and Liberties. Being thus Arm’d with this Warlike Paint, the
antique Warriors make towards their Enemies in a disorder’d manner,
without any Soldier-like Marching, or Warlike Postures, being deaf to
any word of Command, ignorant of falling off or on, of doubling Ranks or
Files, but let flie their winged Shaftsmen without either fear or wit:
Their Artillery being spent, he that hath no Arms to Fight, finds Legs
to run away.

[Sidenote: Their Games and Sports of Activity.]

They have two sorts of Games, one call’d _Puim_, the other _Hubbub_, not
much unlike Cards and Dice, being no other than Lottery. _Puim_ is fifty
or sixty small Bents of a Foot long, which they divide to the number of
their Gamesters, shuffling them first between the Palms of their Hands;
he that hath more than his Fellow, is so much the forwarder in his Game:
Many other Whimsies be in this Game, which would be too long to commit
to Paper. He that is a noted Gamester hath a Hole in his Ear, wherein he
carries his _Puims_ in defiance of his Antagonists. _Hubbub_ is five
small Bones in a small smooth Tray; the Bones be like a Die, but
something flatter, black on the one side and white on the other, which
they place on the Ground, against which violently thumping the Platter,
the Bones mount, changing colours with the windy whisking of their Hands
to and fro; which action in that sport they much use, smiting themselves
on the Breast and Thighs, crying out _Hub, Hub, Hub_; they may be heard
play at this Game a quarter of a Mile off: The Bones being all black or
white make a double Game; if three of one colour, and two of another,
then they afford but a single Game; four of a colour, and one differing,
is nothing; so long as the Man wins he keeps the Tray, but if he loose
the next Man takes it. They are so bewitch’d with these two Games, that
they will lose sometimes all they have; Beaver, _Moose_-skins, Kettles,
_Wampompeage_, _Mowhacks_, Hatchets, Knives, all is confiscate by these
two Games. For their Sports of action they have commonly but three or
four, as Football, Shooting, Running, and Swimming; when they play
Countrey against Countrey, there are rich Goals, all behung with
_Wampompeage_, _Mowhacks_, Beaver Skins, and black Otter Skins: Their
Goals are a Mile long plac’d on the Sands, which are as even as a Board;
their Ball is no bigger than a Hand-ball, which sometimes they mount in
the Air with their naked Feet, sometimes it is sway’d by the multitude,
sometime also it is two days before they get a Goal, then they mark the
Ground they win, and begin there the next day. Before they come to this
Sport they paint themselves, even as when they go to War, in policy to
prevent future mischief, because no man should know him that mov’d his
patience, or accidentally hurt his Person, taking away the occasion of
studying revenge. Before they begin, their Arms are put off, and hung
upon some neighboring Tree, after which they make a long scrowl on the
Sand, over which they shake Hands, and with loving Hearts scuffle for
Victory. While the Men Play, the Boys Pipe, and the Women Dance and Sing
Trophies of their Husbands Conquests; all being done, a Feast summons
their departure.

Such is their dexterity in Shooting, that they can hit a running Hind,
or flying Pigeon, without a standing pause or left-ey’d blinking; they
draw their Arrows between their Fingers and the Thumb, their Bowes are
quick, but not very strong, not killing at above six or seven score
distance: Shooting at one another, they have a trick with swift
conveyance to shun the Arrow; this they do to make them expert against
time of War. They are train’d up to their Bowes even from their
Childhood; for little Boys with Bowes made of little Sticks, and Arrows
made of great Bents; will hit down a piece of Tobacco-pipe every time a
good way off. As these _Indians_ are good Marks-men, so are they well
experienc’d where the very Life of every Creature lieth, and know where
to smite him to make him die presently. Their Swimming is not after our
_English_ fashion, of spread Arms and Legs, which they hold too tiresom,
but like Dogs, their Arms before them, cutting through the Liquids with
their right Shoulder: In this manner they will Swim very swift and far,
either in rough or smooth Waters, sometimes for their ease lying as
still as a Log; sometimes they will play the Dive-doppers, and come up
in unexpected places.

[Sidenote: Of their Huntings.]

For their Hunting, it is to be noted, that they have no swift-footed
Greyhounds to let slip at the sight of the Deer, no deep-mouth’d Hounds,
or scenting Beagles, to find out their desired Prey; themselves are all
this, who in that time of the year when the Deer comes down, having
certain Hunting-houses in such places where they know the Deer doth
usually frequent, in which they keep their Rendezvouz, their Snares, and
all their Accoutrements for that Employment: when they get sight of a
Deer, _Moose_, or Bear, they study how to get the Wind of him, and
approaching within shot, stab their Mark quite through, if the Bones
hinder not. The chief thing they Hunt after is Deer, _Mooses_ and Bears:
It grieves them more to see an _English_-man take one Deer, than a
thousand Acres of Land. They Hunt likewise after Wolves, wild Cats,
_Rackoons_, Otters, Beavers, and _Musquashes_, Trading both their Skins
and Flesh to the _English_. Beside this Artillery they have other
devices to kill their Game, as sometimes Hedges, a Mile or two Miles
long, being a Mile wide at one end, and made narrower and narrower by
degrees, leaving onely a Gap of six Foot long; over against which in the
day-time they lie lurking, to shoot the Deer which come through that
narrow passage; so many as come within the circumference of that Hedge,
seldom return back to leap over, unless they be forc’d by the chasing of
some ravenous Wolf, or sight of some accidental Passenger: In the Night,
at the Gap of this Hedge, they set Deer-traps, which are Springes made
of young Trees, and smooth wrought Cords, so strong, that it will toss a
Horse if he be caught in it.

[Sidenote: Of their Fishings.]

In the Trade of Fishing they are very expert, being experienc’d in the
knowledge of all Baits for several Fishes, and divers Seasons; being not
ignorant likewise of the removal of Fishes, knowing when to Fish in
Rivers, and when at Rocks, when in Bays, and when at Seas: Since the
_English_ came they are furnish’d with _English_ Hooks and Lines, for
before they made them of Hemp, being more curiously wrought, of stronger
Materials than ours, and hook’d with Bone-Hooks; but laziness drives
them to buy, more than profit or commendations wins them to make of
their own. They make likewise very strong Sturgeon-nets, with which they
catch Sturgeons of twelve, fourteen, and sixteen, and some eighteen Foot
long in the day-time, and in the night-time they betake themselves to
their Birchen _Canoos_, in which they carry a forty-fathom Line, with a
sharp-bearded Dart fastned at the end thereof; then lighting a Torch
made of Birchen Rinds, they wave it to and again by their _Canoo_ side,
which the Sturgeon much delighted with, comes to them tumbling and
playing, turning up his white Belly, into which they thrust their Lance,
his Back being impenetrable; which done, they hale to the Shore their
strugling Prize. They have often recourse into the Rocks whereupon the
Sea beats, in warm Weather, to look out for sleepy Seals, whose Oyl they
much esteem, using it for divers things. In Summer they Fish any where,
but in Winter in the fresh Water onely, and Ponds; in frosty Weather
they cut round Holes in the Ice, about which they will sit like so many
Apes with their naked Breeches upon the cold Ice, catching of Pikes,
Pearches, Breams, and other sorts of fresh-Water Fish.

[Sidenote: Of their Arts and Manufactures.]

Their Arts and Manufactures are divers, as first their dressing of all
manner of Skins, which they do by scraping and rubbing, afterwards
painting them with antique Embroiderings in unchangeable Colours;
sometimes they take off the Hair, especially if it be not kill’d in
season. Their Bowes they make of a handsom shape, strung commonly with
the Sinews of _Mooses_; their Arrows of young Elder, feather’d with
Feathers of Eagles Wings and Tails, headed with Brass in shape of a
Heart or Triangle, fastned in a slender piece of Wood six or eight
Inches long, which is fram’d to put loose in the pithy Elder, afterwards
bound fast for riving: Their Arrows are made in this manner, because it
might shake from his Head, and be left behind for their finding, and the
Pile onely remain to gaul the wounded Beast. Their Cordage is so even,
soft, and smooth, that it looks more like Silk than Hemp. Their Sturgeon
Nets are not deep, nor above thirty or forty Foot long, which in ebbing
low Waters they stake fast to the Ground where they are sure the
Sturgeon will come, never looking more at it till the next low Water.
Their _Canoos_ are made either of Pine-trees, which before they were
acquainted with _English_ Tools, they burn’d hollow, scraping them
smooth with Clam-shells and Oyster-shells, cutting their out-sides with
Stone Hatchets. These Boats are not above a Foot and a half, or two Foot
wide, and twenty Foot long. Their other _Canoos_ be made of thin Birch
Rinds, close Ribb’d, and on the in-side with broad thin Hoops, like the
Hoops of a Tub; these are made very light, a Man may carry one of them a
Mile, being made purposely to carry from River to River, and from Bay to
Bay, to shorten Land-passages. In these cockling Fly-boats, wherein an
_English_-man can scarce sit without a fearful tottering, they will
venture to Sea, when an _English_ Shallop dare not bear a Knot of Sail,
scudding over the over-grown Waves as fast as a wind-driven Ship, being
driven by their Paddles, being much like Battle-doors; if a cross Wave
(which is seldom) turn her Keel up-side down, they by swimming free her,
and scramble into her again.

[Sidenote: Of their Language.]

Their Language, is onely peculiar to themselves, not inclining to any of
the more refined Tongues. Some have thought they might be of the
dispersed _Jews_, because some of their words are near unto the
_Hebrew_; but by the same rule they may conclude them to be some of the
gleanings of all Nations, because they have words which sound after the
_Greek_, _Latine_, _French_, and other Tongues. Their Language is hard
to learn, few of the _English_ being able to speak any of it, or capable
of the right pronunciation, which is the chief grace of their Tongue:
They pronounce much after the Diphthongs, excluding _L_ and _R_ which in
our _English_ Tongue they pronounce with as much difficulty, as most of
the _Dutch_ do _T_ and _H_, calling a Lobster a _Nobstann_. Every
Countrey doth something differ in their Speech, even as our Northern
People do from the Southern, and Western from them; especially the
_Tarrentine_, whose Tongue runs so much upon _R_ that they wharle much
in pronunciation. When any Ships come near the Shore, they demand
whether they are King _Charles’s Torries_, with such a rumbling sound,
as if one were beating on an unbrac’d Drum. In serious Discourse our
Southern _Indians_ use seldom any short Colloquies, but speak their
minds at large, without any interjected Discourses from any, the rest
giving diligent audience to his utterance; which done, some or other
returns him as long an Answer: They love not to speak _multa, sed
multum_; seldom are their words and their deeds strangers. According to
the matter of their discourse, so are their acting Gestures in their
Expressions.

[Sidenote: Of their Deaths, Burials and Mourning.]

The _Indians_ are of lusty and healthful Bodies, not experimentally
knowing those Diseases which are incident to other Countreys, as
Feavers, Pleurisies, Calentures, Agues, Consumptions, Convulsions,
Apoplexies, Dropsies, Gouts, Pox, Measles, or the like, but spin out the
thred of their Days to a fair length, numbering sixty, eighty, some a
hundred years: But when any one lies a dying, the doleful cries, and
throbbing sighs of the Friends and Relations, express unspeakable
sorrow; and when the Party is dead and laid in the Ground, they not
onely weep and howl for a good space over the Grave, but also keep
Annual Solemnities of Mourning, rubbing their Faces with black Lead all
about the Eye-brows, and part of their Cheeks; yet do they hold the
Immortality of the Soul, in which their _Indian_ Faith jumps much with
the _Turkish Alchoran_, dreaming of a certain Paradise, or South-West
_Elysium_, wherein they shall everlastingly abide, solacing themselves
in odoriferous Gardens, fruitful Corn-fields, green Meadows, bathing
their tawny Hides in the cool Streams of pleasant Rivers, and sheltering
themselves from Heat and Cold in the sumptuous Palaces fram’d by Nature,
concluding, that neither care nor pain shall molest them, but that
Natures bounty will administer all things with a voluntary contribution
from the Store-house of their _Elysium_; at the Portal whereof, they
say, lies a great Dog, whose churlish snarlings deny admission to
unworthy Intruders: wherefore it is their custom to bury with them their
Bowes and Arrows, and good store of their _Wampompeage_ and _Mowhacks_,
the one to affright that affronting _Cerberus_, the other to purchase
more immense Prerogatives in their Paradise. For their Enemies and loose
Livers, whom they account unworthy of this imaginary Happiness, they say
that they pass to the infernal Dwellings of _Abamocho_, to be tortur’d
according to the Fictions of the ancient _Heathen_.

[Sidenote: Dispositions, Employments, Usage by their Husbands, Apparel,
           and Modesty of the Women.]

The drudgery of all laborious sorts of Work, and the management of all
domestick Affairs, lies wholly upon the _Indian_ Women, who are made
meer Slaves by their Husbands; they build the Houses, sowe and reap the
Corn, provide Lobsters for their Husbands to bait their Hooks when they
go a Fishing for _Basse_ or Cod; and for these Lobsters they are many
times forc’d to dive in the extreamest Weather, then lug home a great
weight of them upon their Backs, as also all the Fish which their
Husbands catch for pleasure, from the places where they were caught:
They dress all the Meat, serve it up to their Husbands, and waiting till
they have fill’d their Bellies, are glad of their leavings. In Summer
they gather Flags, of which they make Mats for Houses, and Hemp and
Rushes, with Dying Stuff, of which they make curious Baskets, with
intermixed Colours and Pourtraictures of antique Imagery. These Baskets
are of all sizes from a Quart to a Quarter, in which they carry their
Luggage. In Winter they are their Husbands Caterers, trudging to the
Clam-banks for their Belly-timber, and their Porters to lug it home.
They likewise sew their Husbands Shoes, and weave Coats of _Turky_
Feathers, besides all their ordinary Houshold drudgery which daily lies
upon them, insomuch that a great Belly hinders no business, nor doth a
Child-birth take much time, but the young Infant being greas’d and
footed, wrapp’d in a Beavers Skin, bound with his Feet up to his Bum,
upon a Board two Foot long and one Foot broad, and his Face expos’d to
all nipping Weather, this little _Pappouse_ travels about with his
bare-footed Mother to paddle in the Icy Clam-banks, after three or four
days of Age have confirm’d her recovery. For their Carriage, it is very
civil, Smiles being the greatest grace of their Mirth. Their Musick is
Lullabies in Rocking their Children, who generally are as quiet as if
they had neither Spleen or Lungs. Their Voices are generally both sweet
and well order’d, so far as pure Nature teacheth them. Their Modesty
drives them to wear more Clothes than the Men, having always a Coat of
Cloth or Skins, wrapp’d like a Blanket about their Loyns, reaching down
to their Hams, which they never put off in Company.

[Sidenote: Towns built by the _English_ in _New England_.]

There are to be reckon’d up forty five chief Towns, besides what others
there may be of less note, built or made habitable by the _English_
since their first arrival in _New England_, till about the Year 1650.

[Sidenote: _St. Georges Fort._]

First, _St. Georges Fort_, where the first Plantation was setled, at the
Mouth of the River _Sagadebock_, in a kind of _Peninsula_, or half
Island.

[Sidenote: _New Plymouth._]

The second, _New Plymouth_, seated no less commodiously upon a large
Bay, call’d by the Natives _Pautuxed_; where they first setled that went
over out of dissatisfaction to the Church-Government of _England_.

[Sidenote: _Salem._]

The third, _Salem_, call’d by the _Indians_, _Mahumbeak_; which stands
on the middle of a Neck of Land very pleasantly, having a South River on
the one side, and a North River on the other side. This Town seems to
have been built in the Year 1628. by a part of that Company, who, being
sent over by the _Merchant-Adventurers_, setled themselves in this Cape.

[Sidenote: _Charles-town._]

The fourth _Mashawmut_, or _Charles-town_, situate on a Neck of Land on
the Northside of the River _Charles_. The form of this Town, in the
Frontispiece of it, resembleth the Head, Neck, and Shoulders of a Man;
through the right Shoulder whereof runs the Navigable River _Mistick_,
which by its near approach to _Charles_ River in one place, makes the
chief part of the Town a _Peninsula_: It consists of a hundred and fifty
Dwelling-houses, many of them beautifi’d with pleasant Gardens and
Orchards: Near the Water-side is a large Market-place, forth of which
issue two fair Streets; and in it stands a large and well built Church.

[Sidenote: _Dorchester._]

The fifth, _Matapan_, or _Dorchester_, a Fronteer Town, standing over
against the Island near the Sea-side: It is water’d with two small
Rivers, and is built in the form of a Serpent turning its Head
Northward; it hath Orchards and Gardens full of Fruit-trees.

[Sidenote: _Boston._]

The sixth is _Boston_, anciently _Accomonticus_, the Center and
Metropolis of the rest, built in the form of a Heart, and fortifi’d with
two Hills on the Front-part thereof, the one having great store of
Artillery mounted thereon, the other having a strong Battery, built of
whole Timber, and fill’d with Earth: At the Descent of the Hill lies a
large Cave or Bay, on which the chief part of this Town is built,
over-topp’d with a third Hill, all three like over-topping Towers,
keeping a constant Watch to foresee the approach of foreign Dangers. The
chiefest part of this City-like Town is crowded upon the Sea Banks, and
wharf’d out with great Industry and Cost, the Edifices large and
beautiful, whose continual enlargement presageth some sumptuous City.

[Sidenote: _Roxbury._]

The seventh, _Roxbury_, situated between _Boston_ and _Dorchester_,
water’d with cool and pleasant Springs issuing from the Rocky Hills, and
with small Freshets watering the Valleys of this fertile Town: The form
of it resembleth a Wedge double pointed, entring between the two
above-mention’d Towns; and in the room of those Swamps, or tearing
Bushes which were there before, they have now goodly Fruit-trees,
fruitful Fields and Gardens.

[Sidenote: _Lynne._]

The eighth is _Lynne_, or (according to the _Indian_ Name, _Saugus_)
situated between _Salem_ and _Charles-town_, near a River, whose strong
Freshet at the end of Winter fills all her Banks, and with a violent
Torrent vents it self into the Sea. This Town is almost square,
consisting many years ago of above a hundred Dwelling-houses, having
also an Iron Mill in constant use. The Church being on a level Land,
undefended from the North-West Wind, is made with Steps descending into
the Earth.

[Sidenote: _Water-town._]

The ninth is call’d _Water-town_, anciently _Pigsgusset_, situated upon
one of the Branches of _Charles_-River, water’d with many pleasant
Springs and small Rivulets, running like Veins throughout her Body. This
Town began by occasion of Sir _Richard Saltingstall_, who arriving with
store of Cattel and Servants, Winter’d in these Parts.

[Sidenote: _New-town._]

[Sidenote: _Harverd Colledge._]

In the Year 1633. there was erected between _Charles-town_ and
_Water-town_, a Place call’d _New-town_, and by the _Indians_,
_Amongcangen_, since nam’d _Cambridge_, being the tenth in order: It is
in form like a List of Broad-cloth, reaching to the most Southerly part
of _Merrimeck_ River; it hath comely and well order’d Streets, and two
fair Colledges; the first call’d _Harverd Colledge_, from Mr. _John
Harverd_, who at his Death gave a thousand Pounds to it; to the other
Mr. _John Harnes_ was the chief Benefactor. This Town was appointed to
be the Seat of the Government, but it continu’d not long.

[Sidenote: _Ipswich._]

The eleventh call’d _Ipswich_, or _Sawacatuc_ by the _Indians_, is
situated on a fair and delightful River, issuing forth from a very
pleasant Pond, and afterwards breaking its Course through a hideous
Swamp of large extent; it lies in the _Sagamoreship_, or Earldom of
_Aggawan_, now by the _English_ call’d _Essex_.

[Sidenote: _Newbury._]

Twelve Miles from _Ipswich_, near upon the Streams of _Merrimeck_ River,
is situated the twelfth, call’d _Newbury_.

[Sidenote: _Hartford._]

The People of _New-town_, or _Cambridge_, upon their removal of the
Plantation of _Canectico_, passing up the River, built a Town, which
they call’d _Hartford_, the thirteenth in number, divers others coming
in the room of those that departed from _Cambridge_.

[Sidenote: _Concord._]

The fourteenth, seated upon a fair fresh River (whose Rivulets are
fill’d with fresh Marsh, and her Streams with Fish, it being a Branch of
that large River of _Merrimeck Allwives_) is built in the Inland
Countrey, and call’d _Concord_: It consisted at first of above fifty
Families: Their Buildings are for the most part conveniently plac’d on
one streight Stream under a Sunny Bank, in a low Level. The People that
first set forth to build this Town, sustain’d great hardship and misery,
by reason of the uncouth Ways, and extremity of the Weather, it being
the first Inland Town that was built.

[Sidenote: _Hingham._]

South-East of _Charles_-River, upon the Sea-Coast, is situated the
fifteenth Town _Hingham_; the form whereof is somewhat intricate to
describe, by reason of the Seawasting Crooks, where it beats upon a
moultring Shore; yet in some places the Streets are compleat: It
consisted at first of about sixty Families.

[Sidenote: _Dukesbury_, or _Sandwich_.]

The sixteenth is in _Plymouth_ Government, situate upon the Sea-Coast,
first nam’d _Dukes-bury_, afterwards _Sandwich_.

[Sidenote: _Newhaven._]

About the year 1617. a new Supply coming over into these Parts, and not
finding in the _Mattachusets_ Government any commodious place to settle
in, they after much search took up a place somewhat more Southerly, near
the _Shalles_ of _Capecod_, where they found a commodious Harbor for
Shipping, and a fit place to erect a Town in, which they built in a
short time, with very fair Houses and compleat Streets; and shortly
after several others: Amongst which they erected a new Government, which
from their first Fronteer Town, being the seventeenth, was call’d
_Newhaven_.

[Sidenote: _Dedham._]

The eighteenth is in the Government of the _Mattachusets_, and call’d
_Dedham_, being an Inland Town, situate about ten Miles from _Boston_ in
the County of _Suffolk_, well water’d with many pleasant Streams, and
abounding with Gardens and Fruit-Trees: It consisted at first of about a
hundred Families, being generally given to Husbandry.

[Sidenote: _Weymouth._]

The nineteenth being also in this Government is call’d _Weymouth_,
batter’d on the East with the Sea Waves; on the South-West Rocks and
Swamps make it delightful to the Deer, as the ploughable Meadow-Lands to
the Inhabitants.

About the Year 1638. _Printing_ was brought over into _New England_.

[Sidenote: _Rowly._]

About six Miles from _Ipswich_, North-Eastward, was erected another Town
call’d _Rowly_, being the twentieth.

[Sidenote: _Hampton._]

About the Year 1639. began the one and twentieth Town _Hampton_, in the
County of _Norfolk_, to be built: It is situate near the Sea-Coast, not
far from the River of _Merrimeck_: The great store of salt Marsh did
entice the People to set down their Habitations there.

[Sidenote: _Salisbury._]

Not far from this Town of _Hampton_, was erected the two and twentieth,
call’d _Salisbury_, seated upon the broad swift Torrent of
_Merrimeck_-River: It lieth on the Northern side, over against the Town
of _Newbury_, the River between them being about half a Mile broad, but
hath an Island in the midst thereof, which makes it the more easily
passable. The situation of this Town is very pleasant, the Skirts
thereof abounding in fair and goodly Meadows, with good store of stately
Timber in many places upon the Uplands.

[Sidenote: _Long-Island, Southampton._]

About the Year 1640. by a fresh Supply of People that setled in
_Long-Island_, was there erected the twenty third Town, call’d
_Southampton_; by the Indians, _Agawom_.

[Sidenote: _Sudbury._]

The same Year also the Town of _Sudbury_, being the twenty fourth, began
to be built in the Inland Countrey: It is furnish’d with great store of
fresh Marsh, but lying very low, it is much endammag’d with Land-floods.

[Sidenote: _Braintree._]

About this time there was built at Mount _Wollestone_, by some old
Planters and certain Farmers of the great Town of _Boston_, a Town nam’d
_Braintree_, being the twenty fifth, within the _Mattachusets_
Government: It is well peopled, and hath great store of Land in Tillage.

[Sidenote: _Gloucester._]

In the Year 1641. Mr. _Richard Blindman_ coming from _Green Harbour_, a
Place in _Plymouth_ Patent, with some few People of his acquaintance,
setled in _Cape Anne_, where they built the twenty sixth Town, and nam’d
it _Gloucester_.

[Sidenote: _Dover._]

There is also situate upon _Puscataque_ River, to the North-East of
_Boston_, a Town call’d _Dover_, being the twenty seventh, the People by
voluntary resignation being under the _Mattachusets_ Government.

[Sidenote: _Wooburn._]

In the Year 1642. was erected the eight and twentieth Town, call’d
_Wooburn_.

[Sidenote: _Reading._]

In the Year 1644. _Reading_ the nine and twentieth Town was built, being
in the Government of the _Mattachusets_; it is well water’d and situated
about a great Pond, having two Mills, a Saw-Mill, and a Corn-Mill, which
stand upon two several Streams.

[Sidenote: _Wenham._]

A little after was built the thirtieth Town in this Colony, call’d
_Wenham_, situate between _Salem_ and _Ipswich_; it is very well
water’d, as most Inland Towns are, and the People live altogether on
Husbandry.

[Sidenote: _Spring-field._]

About the Year 1645. one Mr. _Pinchin_, having out of desire to improve
his Estate by Trading with the _Indians_, setled himself in a place very
remote from any of the Towns of the _Mattachusets_ Colony, yet under
their Government, and great store of People still resorting to him, they
at last erected a Town upon the River _Canectico_, calling it
_Spring-field_, being the one and thirtieth Town; it is very fitly
seated for a Beaver Trade with the _Indians_, in regard it is situate
upon this large Navigable River, and upon some Rivulets of the same.

[Sidenote: _Haverhill._]

In the Year 1648. was founded the Town of _Haverhill_, being the two and
thirtieth, about a Mile or two from the place where the River of
_Merrimeck_ receives into it self the River _Shawshin_, which is one of
her three chief Heads.

[Sidenote: _Malden._]

Not long after, the Town of _Malden_, being the three and thirtieth
Town, was built by certain People that came out of _Charles-Town_; these
two Towns being sever’d the one from the other by the large River of
_Mistick_.

The rest we shall onely name, as 34. _Berwick_, alias _Chawun_. 35
_Oxford_, alias _Sagoquas_. _Falmouth_, alias _Totam_. 36. _Bristol._
37. _Hull_, alias _Passataquack_. 38. _Dartmouth_, alias _Bohanna_. 39.
_Norwich_, alias _Segocket_. 40. _Taunton_, alias _Cohannet_. 41.
_Greens-Harbour._ 42. _Yarmouth._ 43. _Northam_, alias _Pascataqua_. 44.
_Exeter._ 45. _Weymouth._

The chief Rivers of _New England_ are, _Pascataway_, _Sagadahoc_,
_Pemmaquid_, _Agamentico_, _Merrimeck_, _Tachobacco_, _Mistick_,
_Narraganset_, _Mishuwin_, _Connectacut_, _Newichwavoch_, _Kynebequy_.

[Sidenote: The present state of the Natives.]

The _Indian_ Natives are now become so weak in number, and in some
measure reduc’d to a dread of the growth of the _English_, that of late
years they have not practis’d any thing against them, or at least, not
justifi’d them by numbers in open Hostility, willing rather to purchase
their Peace and buy off Injuries committed by them at the Price of their
Lands and Possessions.

And although care and expence hath been many years apply’d to the
Conversion of _Indians_ to the Faith, however inclinable they seem’d at
first to the imbracing thereof, not then so well discerning the
insincerity of its Professors; yet there are so few of late who do
imbrace it or persevere in it (wanting a good Foundation for instruction
in Moral Honesty, and perhaps the example of it in those that undertake
to instruct them in Religion;) that _Christianity_ to them seems a
_Chimera_, Religion a design to draw them from the libidinous Pleasures
of a lazy Life; however, some there are who make Profession of
_Christianity_, and some who are educated in the Schools of _New
Cambridge_, to entitle them to Preach the Gospel in their own Language.

One great hindrance to the Propagation of the Faith amongst those
_Heathens_, is the diversity of their Languages; for it is commonly
known, that the Natives themselves do not understand one another, if
their Habitations are but at forty Miles distance.

[Sidenote: Church-Government among the _English_.]

Their Church-Government and Discipline is Congregational and
Independent, yet in some places more rigid than others, for in many
Towns there yet remains some leaven of _Presbytery_, from which Sects
our _Independency_ had its Original; insomuch, that one of the most
remarkable Opposers of _Episcopal Government_, Doctor _Bastwick_ (who,
spoil’d so much Paper in railing at the Church Government of _England_,
and crying up _Liberty of Conscience_) finding the Apostacy of his own
Brethren of _Boston_ from their first Principles, and his, generally
prevail over them, even to the denying that liberty to others, which
they seem’d only to aim at, did write a large and vehement _Dehortatory
Epistle_ to them from their _New Lights_ or _Paths_, saying, _That
according to their present Tenents, they could not pretend to be, or
other than a Christian Synagogue_.

[Sidenote: Their Civil Government and Laws.]

Their Laws and Methods of Government are wholly of their own framing,
each Colony for themselves, makes an Annual choice of Governor, Deputy
Governor, and a certain number of Assistants, by the plurality of
Suffrages collected from their several Towns, the Electors are only
Free-men and Church-Members; for he that is not a Member of their
Church, can neither chuse, nor be chosen a Magistrate, nor have his
Children Baptiz’d; besides the loss of many other Priviledges, and
liable moreover to frequent, if not constant Mulcts for absenting
themselves from _Divine Worship_ (so call’d) in their Meeting-houses.

Since the transmitting of the Patent in _New England_, the Election is
not by Voices, nor erection of Hands as formerly, but by Papers, thus:

The general Court-electory sitting, where are present in the Church, or
Meeting-house at _Boston_, the old Governor, Deputy, and all the
Magistrates, and two Deputies or Burgesses for every Town, or at least
one; all the Freemen are bid to come in at one Door, and bring their
Votes in Paper for the new Governor, and deliver them down upon the
Table, before the Court, and so pass forth at another Door; those that
are absent, send their Votes by Proxies. All being deliver’d in, the
Votes are counted, and according to the major part, the old Governor
pronounceth, _That such an one is chosen Governor for the year ensuing_.
Then the Freemen, in like manner, bring their Votes for the Deputy
Governor, who being also chosen, the Governor propoundeth the Assistants
one after another. New Assistants are, of late, put in nomination, by an
Order of general Court, beforehand to be consider’d of: If a Freeman
give in a Blank, that rejects the Man nam’d; if the Freeman makes any
mark with a Pen upon the Paper which he brings, that elects the Man
nam’d: Then the Blanks and mark’d Papers are number’d, and according to
the major part of either, the Man in Nomination stands elected or
rejected; and so for all the Assistants. And after every new Election,
which is, by their Patent, to be upon the last Wednesday in _Easter_
Term, the new Governor and Officers are all new Sworn. The Governor and
Assistants chuse the Secretary. And all the Court consisting of
Governor, Deputy, Assistants, and Deputies of Towns, give their Votes as
well as the rest; and the Ministers and Elders, and all Church-Officers,
have their Votes also in all these Elections of chief Magistrates:
Constables, and all other inferior Officers, are sworn in the general,
quarter, or other Courts, or before any Assistant.

Every Free-man when he is admitted, takes a strict Oath, to be true to
the Society or Jurisdiction.

There are two general Courts, one every half year, wherein they make
Laws or Ordinances: The Ministers advise in making of Laws, especially
Ecclesiastical, and are present in Courts, and advise in some special
Causes Criminal, and in framing of Fundamental Laws.

There are besides four Quarter-Courts for the whole Jurisdiction,
besides other petty Courts, one every quarter at _Boston_, _Salem_, and
_Ipswich_, with their several Jurisdictions; besides every Town, almost,
hath a petty Court for small Debts and Trespasses, under twenty
Shillings.

[Sidenote: Actions and Causes.]

In the general Court, or great quarter Courts, before the Civil
Magistrates, are try’d all Actions and Causes Civil and Criminal, and
also Ecclesiastical, especially touching Non-members: And they
themselves say, that in the general and quarter Courts, they have the
Power of Parliament, Kings-Bench, Common-Pleas, Chancery,
High-Commission, and Star-Chamber, and all other Courts of _England_,
and in divers Cases have exercis’d that Power upon the Kings Subjects
there, as is not difficult to prove. They have put to death, banish’d,
fin’d Men, cut off Mens Ears, whip’d, imprison’d Men, and all these for
Ecclesiastical and Civil Offences, and without sufficient Record. In the
lesser quarter Courts are try’d, in some, Actions under ten Pounds, in
_Boston_, under twenty, and all Criminal Causes not touching Life or
Member. From the petty quarter Courts, or other Courts, the parties may
appeal to the great quarter Courts, from thence to the general Court,
from which there is no Repeal.

[Sidenote: Grand-Juries.]

Twice a year, in the said quarter Courts held before the general Courts,
are two Grand-Juries sworn for the Jurisdiction, one for one Court, and
the other for the other; and they are charg’d to enquire and Present
Offences reduc’d by the Governor who gives the Charge.

[Sidenote: Trials.]

Matters of Debt, Trespass, and upon the Case, and Equity, yea and of
Heresie also, are try’d by a Jury.

The Parties are warn’d to challenge any Jury-man before he be sworn; but
because there is but one Jury in a Court for trial of Causes; and all
Parties not present at their Swearing, the liberty of challenge is much
hinder’d, and some inconveniences do happen thereby. Jurors are return’d
by the Marshal, he was at first call’d _The Beadle of the Society_.

The Parties in all Causes, speak themselves for the most part, and some
of the Magistrates where they think cause requireth, do the part of
Advocates without Fee or Reward.

Though among the several Colonies which were founded here by the
confluence of dissenting Zealots, this Government is exercis’d,
differing from that of the Church and State of _England_: yet in those
Provinces which are granted by particular Persons, the Government is
much more conformable to that of _England_; but as the _Mattachusets_ or
_Bostoners_ were from the beginning the most Potent and Predominant of
all the rest of the Colonies, (insomuch, that _Boston_ may well be
accounted the Metropolis of all _New England_,) so of late years they
have still usurp’d more and more Power and Authority over the rest; and
especially have not stuck to give Laws to the foresaid Provinces
allotted to particular Persons, and have gone about wholly to subjugate
those places to themselves, intrenching upon the rights of the true
Proprietors; and that, even contrary to the Kings express Commands by
his Officers, there, and as it were in open defiance of his Majesty and
Government, as is evident from this following Narration, of their
behavior upon a business of this nature.


[Sidenote: Proceedings of the _Mattachusets_ against his Majesties
           Commissioners.]

In the Year of our Lord 1665. his Majesties Commissioners for the
Affairs of _New England_, being in the Province of _Mayne_, the People
being much unsetled in Point or Government, by reason the _Mattachusets_
Colony, or _Boston_ Government, did usurp compulsively a Power over them
contrary to their wills; and the right of Sir _Ferdinando Gorges_ Heir,
who had his Commission then in the place, did unanimously Petition to
his Majesties Commissioners to settle the Government; upon which the
said Commissioners examin’d the Bounds and Right of Mr. _Gorges_ Patent,
with all the Allegations and Pretensions on both sides, and so according
to their Instruction from his Majesty, did settle a temporary Government
under his Majesty’s immediate Authority, until such time as his Majesty
should give his final determination thereof; and for that end did
Institute Justices of the Peace to Govern the Province according to the
true Laws of _England_. Also his Majesty was pleas’d by his _Mandamus_
in _April 1666_, to the Governors of _Boston_, to signifie that it was
his will and pleasure, That the Province of _Main_ should stand good as
his Commissioners had setled it, until he had more leisure to determine
it; yet notwithstanding, after three years quiet possession, and
exercising of Government by the Kings Justices, according to their
Commission granted by his Majesty’s Commissioners, the _Bostoners_,
without any Conference with the said Justices, did in a hostile manner
oppose the King’s Power, _July 1668._ which was as followeth:

The General Court of _Boston_ sent their Warrants to keep Court at
_York_ under their Authority, and for that purpose Commissionated
Magistrates by their own Authority, namely Major General _John Leveret_,
Mr. _Edward Ting_, Captain _Richard Walden_, and Captain _Robert Pike_:
Whereupon the King’s Justices did oppose their Warrants, and sent Post
to _New York_, with an Address to General _Nicholas_, for Advice what to
do therein; who forthwith dispatch’d away to the Governors of _Boston_,
informing them of the danger of their Proceeding, it being an open
breach of Duty, to subvert the Government establish’d by his Majesty’s
Power; also sent the King’s _Mandamus_, _April 1666._ that will’d to the
contrary. Notwithstanding the _Boston_ Magistrates in _July 1668._ in
order to their _Boston_ Commission, came to _York_ Town in the said
Province, with several Armed Men, Horse and Foot, to keep Court under
their Authority; Opposition was made by the King’s Justices, and his
Majesty’s Power was urg’d, but little regard thereunto shewn; his
Majesties _Mandamus_ was likewise much insisted upon, and produced by
the Justices, who ask’d the _Bostoners_ what they thought of it? and how
they durst act so contrary to the King’s Will and Pleasure? Major
General _Leveret_ told them, That he believ’d it might be the King’s
Hand, but he had a Commission from the general Court at _Boston_, which
he would follow and observe by the help of God. The same day in the
Afternoon the said Major General _Leveret_, with the rest of the
_Boston_ Magistrates, seiz’d and imprison’d the Province Marshal in
doing his Office, and then forthwith went in warlike posture to the
Court-house, where the King’s Justices sat in Judicature, and putting
them from their Seats, sat down themselves in their Places, and Executed
their _Boston_ Commission. The King’s Justices drew a _Protest_ against
their Proceedings, and so left the Decision to God’s Providence, and his
Majesty’s good Pleasure. Then they turn’d out all Officers, both
Military and Civil, and Swore others in their Places under their
Authority; they forc’d the whole Record of the Province out of the
Recorders House contrary to his Will, by vertue of a Special Warrant
from that Court. They imprison’d the Mayor of the said Province about
three weeks, forcing him to give in five hundred Pound Bonds, not to act
according to his Commission; which with some Reservations he was forc’d
to deny for the security of his Estate.

These riotous Proceedings thus acted with such a precipitate fury, so
incens’d his Majesty, that speedy care had been taken to reduce them to
reason, had they not upon mature consideration bethought themselves
afterwards to yield Obedience to his Majesties Orders.

Having treated at large of all that concerns _New England_ in general,
both in reference to the Natives and the _English_ Planters, we shall
conclude with a brief view of the Provinces of _Laconia_ and _Main_, as
they are truly Describ’d (among other ingenuous Collections and
Observations of the Affairs of _America_, and especially these Parts) by
_Ferdinando Gorges_ Esq; Heir to the above-mention’d Sir _Ferdinando_,
and thereby sole Lord of the said Provinces, onely contracting what hath
been by him deliver’d more at large.

[Sidenote: A brief Description of _Laconia_, a Province in _New
           England_.]

Among divers Plantations of the _English_ happily Founded in _New
England_, is a Province to the Landward, nam’d _Laconia_, so call’d by
reason of the great Lakes therein, but by the ancient Inhabitants
thereof it is call’d _The Countrey of the Troquois_: It lies between the
Latitude of forty four and forty five Degrees, having the Rivers of
_Sagadehock_ and _Merrimeck_ on the Sea-Coast of _New England_,
Southerly from it; into each of which Rivers there is a short Passage,
frequented by the Salvages inhabiting near the Lakes. Also it hath the
great Lakes which tend towards _California_ in the South Sea on the West
thereof: On the North thereof is the great River of _Canada_, into which
the said River disgorgeth it self by a fair large River, well
replenish’d with many fruitful Islands: The Air thereof is pure and
wholesom, the Countrey pleasant, having some high Hills, full of goodly
Forrests, and fair Valleys and Plains, fruitful in Corn, Vines,
Chesnuts, Wallnuts, and infinite sorts of other Fruits, large Rivers
well stor’d with Fish, and inviron’d with goodly Meadows full of
Timber-trees.

One of the great Lakes is call’d _The Lake of Troquois_, which together
with a River of the same Name, running into the River of _Canada_, is
sixty or seventy Leagues in length.

In the Lake are four fair Islands, which are low and full of goodly
Woods and Meadows, having store of Game for Hunting, as Stags,
Fallow-Deer, Elks, Roe-Bucks, Beavers, and other sorts of Beasts which
come from the Main Land to the said Islands.

The Rivers which fall into the Lakes have in them good store of Beavers;
of which Beasts, as also of the Elks, the Salvages make their chiefest
Traffick.

The said Islands have been inhabited heretofore by the Salvages, but are
now abandon’d by reason of their late Wars one with another: They
contain twelve or fifteen Leagues in length, and are seated commodiously
for Habitation in the midst of the Lake, which abounds with divers kinds
of wholesom Fish.

From this Lake run two Rivers Southward, which fall into the Eastern and
Southern Sea-Coast of _New England_.

Into this Lake there went many years since certain _French_ of
_Quebeck_, who sided with the _Algovinquins_, with the help of their
_Canoos_, which they carried the space of five Miles over the
_Impossible Falls_, to Fight a Battel in revenge of some former Injuries
done by the _Troquois_ to the _Algovinquins_, who had the Victory; for
which cause the _French_ have been so hated ever since by the Nation of
the _Troquois_, that none of them durst ever appear in any part of that
Lake. But their Trade, said to be sixteen thousand Beavers yearly, is
partly sold to the _Dutch_, who Trade with the Westend of the said Lake
over Land by Horses, from their Plantation upon _Hudson_’s _River_: and
another part is conceiv’d to be purchas’d by the _Hiroons_, who being
Newters, are Friends both to the one and the other; and these _Hiroons_
bring down the greatest part of all by the River of _Canada_.

The Way over Land to this great Lake, from the Plantation of
_Pascataway_, hath been attempted by Captain _Walter Neale_, once
Governor, at the Charges of Sir _Ferdinando Gorges_, Captain _Mason_,
and some Merchants of _London_, and the Discovery wanted but one days
Journey of finishing, because their Victuals was spent, which, for want
of Horses, they were enforc’d to carry with their Arms, and their
Clothes, upon their Backs: They intended to have made a settlement for
Trade by Pinnaces upon the said Lake, which they reckon to be about
ninety or a hundred Miles from the Plantation over Land.

The People of the Countrey are given to Hunting of wild Beasts, which is
their chiefest Food.

Their Arms are Bowes and Arrows. Their Armor is made partly of Wood, and
partly of a kind of twisted Stuff like Cotton-Wool.

Their Meat is Flour of _Indian_ Corn, of that Countreys growth, sodden
to Pap, which they preserve for times of Necessity when they cannot
Hunt.

This Province of _Laconia_, however known by a distinct Name, is
included within the Province of _Main_, which offers it self next to our
consideration.

[Sidenote: Of the Province of _Main_.]

All that part of the Continent of _New England_, which was allotted by
Patent to Sir _Ferdinando Gorges_ and to his Heirs, he thought fit to
call by the Name of _The Province of Main_. It takes it beginning at the
entrance of _Pascatoway_ Harbor, and so passeth up the same into the
River of _Newichwavoch_; and through the same unto the farthest Head
thereof; and from thence North-Westwards for the space of a hundred and
twenty Miles; and from the Mouth of _Pascatoway_ Harbor aforesaid,
North-Eastward along the Sea-Coast, to _Sagadehock_; and up the River
thereof to _Kinibequy_ River, even as far as the Head thereof; and into
the Land North-Westwards, for the space of a hundred and twenty Miles.

To these Territories are also adjoyn’d the North half of the Isles of
_Sholes_, together with the Isles of _Capawick_ and _Nautican_, as also
all the little Islands lying within five Leagues of the _Main_, all
along the Sea-Coast, between the aforesaid Rivers of _Pascatoway_ and
_Sagadehock_.

He no sooner had this Province setled upon him, but he gave publick
notice, That if anyone would undertake by himself and his Associates, to
Transport a competent number of Inhabitants, to Plant in any part of his
Limits, he would assign unto him or them such a proportion of Land, as
should in reason satisfie them, reserving onely to himself some small
High-Rent, as 2 _s._ or 2 _s._ 6 _d._ for a hundred Acres _per Annum_:
and if they went about to build any Town or City, he would Endow them
with such Liberties and Immunities, as should make them capable to
Govern themselves within their own Limits, according to the Liberties
granted to any Town or Corporation within this Realm of _England_. And
as for others of the meaner sort who went as Tenants, that they should
have such quantities of Land assign’d them as they were able to manage,
at the Rate of 4 _d._ or 6 _d._ an Acre, according to the nature or
situation of the Place they settle in.

And for the Division of the Province, and the Form of Government which
he intended to Establish, he first divided the Province into several
Parts; and those again he subdivided into distinct Regiments, as East,
West, North, and South; those again into several Hundreds, Parishes and
Tythings, and these to have their several Officers to Govern, according
to such Laws as should be agreed upon by publick Assent of the
Free-holders, with the approbation of himself or Deputy, and the
principal Officers of the publick State.

The setled Government for the general State, to whom all Appeals were to
be made, and from whom all Instructions for the welfare of the Publick
were to issue, were to consist of himself or his Deputy, who was to be
chosen every three year by himself, with the advice of his Council: Next
a Chancellor for the determination of all Causes; A Treasurer, to whom
the care of the publick Revenue was to be committed; A Marshal, whose
Office was to oversee the Regiments, and to provide Men for publick
Service; An Admiral, to take care of all Maritime Affairs, to whom a
Judge of the Admiralty was to be joyn’d to determine all Maritime
Causes; A Master of the Ordnance, to look to the publick Arms and
Ammunition; A Secretary, to receive Intelligence, and to acquaint
himself or Deputy therewith. To these belong all their several Officers
and Ministers for the Execution of all Matters proper to their several
Places.

The chief Town of this Province is call’d _Gorgiana_, which is Govern’d
by a Mayor, the rest are onely inconsiderable Villages or scatter’d
Houses; but through Encouragement given to Adventurers and Planters, it
may prove in time a very flourishing Place, and be replenish’d with many
fair Towns and Cities, it being a Province both fruitful and pleasant.


                               SECT. II.
                  New Netherland, now call’d New York.

That Tract of Land formerly call’d _The New Netherland_, doth contain
all that Land which lieth in the North parts of _America_, betwixt _New
England_ and _Mary-Land_; the length of which Northward into the
Countrey, as it hath not been fully discover’d, so it is not certainly
known: The breadth of it is about two hundred Miles. The principal
Rivers within this Tract, are _Hudson_’s-River, _Raritan_-River,
_Delaware-Bay_-River. The chief Islands are the _Manhatans_-Island,
_Long_-Island, and _Staten_-Island.

The first which discover’d this Countrey was _Henry Hudson_, who being
hir’d by the _East-India_ Company to seek a Passage in the _Northern
America_ to _China_, set Sail _Anno 1609._ in the _Half-Moon_ Frigat;
coming before _Terre-neuff_, he stood about towards the South-West,
where Sailing up a great River, he found two Men Clad in _Ruffelo_’s
Skins; and from thence arriv’d safe at _Amsterdam_.

_New Netherland_ thus discover’d, invited many Merchants to settle a
firm Plantation there; to which purpose they obtain’d Letters Patents in
1614. granted them by the _States_ in the _Hague_, That they might onely
Traffick to _New Netherland_; whereupon they earnestly prosecuting the
Design, sent out _Adrian Block_ and _Godyn_, who discover’d several
Coasts, Isles, Havens, and Rivers.

The Countrey, as they said, being then void, was therefore free for any
body that would take possession of it: Notwithstanding which pretence,
they were scarce warm in their Quarters, when Sir _Samuel Argal_,
Governor of _Virginia_, having first spoil’d the _French_ in _Accadie_,
as we said, disputed the Possession with these also. And although they
pleaded _Hudson_’s Right (who by Commission from King _James_, and upon
an _English_ Account, had lately discover’d those Parts) and pretended
they had not onely bought all his Cards and Maps of the Countrey, but
all his Interest and Right also, and had fully contented him for all his
Pains and Charges in the Discovery; yet the said _Hudson_ being an
_English_-man, and acting all that he did by Commission from the King of
_England_, upon Debate it was concluded, That the Land could not be
alienated after Discovery without the King of _England_’s consent,
especially it being but a part of the Province of _Virginia_, already
possess’d by the Subjects of _England_: So that they were forc’d to wave
that Title, and the _Dutch_ Governor submitted his Plantation to His
Majesty of _England_, and to the Governor of _Virginia_, for and under
him: Upon which Terms for a good while they held it. Afterwards, upon
confidence, it seems, of a new Governor sent from _Amsterdam_, they not
onely fail’d to pay the promis’d Contribution and Tribute, but fell to
fortifie themselves, and to entitle the Merchants of _Amsterdam_ to an
absolute Propriety and Dominion of the Country, independent of any
other; building Towns, as _New Amsterdam_; raising Forts, as _Orange
Fort_, near the Branch of the _Nordt River_, which they call
_Hell-Gate_. Complaint whereof being made to King _Charles_, and by his
Ambassador represented to the _States_, they disown the business, and
declare by Publick Instrument, that it was onely a private Undertaking,
_viz._ of the _West-India_ Company of _Amsterdam_. Whereupon a
Commission was granted to Sir _George Calvert_, made Lord _Baltimore_ in
_Ireland_, to Possess and Plant the Southern parts thereof, lying
towards _Virginia_, by the name of _Mary-land_; and to Sir _Edmund
Loyden_, to Plant the Northern parts towards _New England_, by the name
of _Nova Albion_: Which makes the _Dutch_ the second time seem willing
to compound; and for the Sum of two thousand and five hundred Pounds,
they offer to be gone, and leave all they had there. But taking
advantage of the troubles in _England_, which then began to appear, and
soon after follow’d, they not only go back from their first
Propositions, and make higher Demands, but also most mischievously (as
some report) furnish the Natives with Arms, and teach them the use of
them, as it may be thought, expecting to use their help upon occasion,
against the _English_.

[Illustration: NOVI BELGII]

After His Majesties Restauration, His Majesty being truly inform’d of
his just Pretences to all that Usurp’d Territory call’d _New
Netherland_, (the same having been formerly part of _New England_) and
of how great prejudice to the Act of Navigation, and how dangerous
Intruders the _Dutchmen_ are generally upon other Princes Dominions,
what mischief might ensue to all our _English_ Plantations in time of
War, if the _Dutch_ were permitted to strengthen themselves in the very
heart of His Majesties Dominions, being Masters of one of the most
commodious Ports and Rivers in _America_: His Majesty resolv’d to seize
upon the same, as his undoubted Right, and in _May 1664._ having
design’d four Commissioners to the perfecting of Affairs in _New
England_, Collonel _Richard Nichols_, Sir _Robert Carr_, _George
Cartwright_, and _Samuel Mawrick_ Esquires, with three Ships of War to
convey them to _Boston_: The matter was so order’d, that the same Ships
serv’d for the reducing of the Town and Fort of _New Amsterdam_, upon
conditions, advantageous to His Majesty, and easie to the _Dutch_.

Now begins _New Netherland_ to lose the Name, for His Majesty having
conferr’d by Patent upon his Royal Highness the Duke of _York_ and
_Albany_, all the Acquisitions made upon Foraigners, together with
_Long-Island_, the West end whereof was wholly setled and Peopled by
_Dutch-men_; his Royal Highness impower’d, by Commission as his
Deputy-Governor, Colonel _Nichols_, Groom of his Bed-chamber, to take
the Charge and Direction of Reducing and Governing all those
Territories; it was by him thought fit, to change some principal
denominations of Places, _viz._ _New Netherland_ into _York-shire_; _New
Amsterdam_ into _New York_; _Fort-Amscel_ into _Fort-James_;
_Fort-Orange_ into _Fort-Albany_; and withal, to change _Burgomasters_,
_Schepen_, and _Schout_, into Mayor, Aldermen, and Sheriff, with
Justices of the Peace; so that all the Civil Policy is conformable to
the Methods and Practise of _England_, whereas _New England_ retains
only the name of _Constable_ in their whole Rolls of Civil Officers.

It is plac’d upon the neck of the Island _Manhatans_, looking towards
the Sea; encompass’d with _Hudson_’s River, which is six Miles broad;
the Town is compact and oval, with very fair Streets and several good
Houses; the rest are built much after the manner of _Holland_, to the
number of about four hundred Houses, which in those parts are held
considerable: Upon one side of the Town is _James-Fort_, capable to
lodge three hundred Souldiers and Officers; it hath four Bastions, forty
Pieces of Cannon mounted; the Walls of Stone, lin’d with a thick Rampart
of Earth; well accommodated with a Spring of fresh Water, always
furnish’d with Arms and Ammunition, against Accidents: Distant from the
Sea seven Leagues, it affords a safe Entrance, even to unskilful Pilots;
under the Town side, Ships of any Burthen may Ride secure against any
Storms, the Current of the River being broken by the interposition of a
small Island, which lies a Mile distant from the Town.

About ten Miles from _New York_ is a Place call’d _Hell-Gate_, which
being a narrow Passage, there runneth a violent Stream both upon Flood
and Ebb; and in the middle lie some Rocky Islands, which the Current
sets so violently upon, that it threatens present Shipwrack; and upon
the Flood is a large Whirlwind, which continually sends forth a hideous
roaring, enough to affright any Stranger from passing farther, and to
wait for some _Charon_ to conduct him through; yet to those that are
well acquainted, little or no danger: It is a place of great Defence
against any Enemy coming in that way, which a small Fortification would
absolutely prevent, and necessitate them to come in at the West end of
_Long-Island_ by _Sandy Hook_, where _Nutten Island_ forces them within
the Command of the Fort at _New York_, which is one of the best Pieces
of Defence in the North parts of _America_. It is built most of Brick
and Stone, and cover’d with red and black Tyle, and the Land being high,
it gives at a distance a pleasing prospect to the Spectators. The
Inhabitants consist most of _English_ and _Dutch_, and have a
considerable Trade with _Indians_ for Beaver, Otter, and
_Rackoon_-Skins, with other Furrs; as also for Bear, Deer and
_Elke_-Skins; and are supply’d with Venison and Fowl in the Winter, and
Fish in the Summer by the _Indians_, which they buy at an easie Rate;
and having the Countrey round about them, they are continually furnish’d
with all such Provisions as is needful for the Life of Man, not onely by
the _English_ and _Dutch_ within their own, but likewise by the adjacent
Colonies.

[Sidenote: _Manhattans_ River.]

The _Manhattans_, or _Great River_, being the chiefest, having with two
wide Mouths wash’d the mighty Island _Watouwaks_, falls into the Ocean.
The Southern Mouth is call’d _Port May_, or _Godyns Bay_. In the middle
thereof lies an Island call’d _The States Island_; and a little higher
the _Manhattans_, so call’d from the Natives, which on the East side of
the River dwell on the Main Continent. They are a cruel People, and
Enemies to the _Hollanders_, as also of the _Sanhikans_, which reside on
the Western Shore. Farther up are the _Makwaes_ and _Mahikans_, which
continually War one against another. In like manner all the Inhabitants
on the West side of the River _Manhattan_ are commonly at Enmity with
those that possess the Eastern Shore; who also us’d to be at variance
with the _Hollanders_, when as the other People Westward kept good
Correspondency with them.

On a small Island near the Shore of the _Makwaes_, lay formerly a Fort,
provided with two Drakes and eleven Stone Guns, yet was at last
deserted.

[Sidenote: Wholesom Waters.]

This Countrey hath many removable Water-falls, descending from steep
Rocks, large Creeks and Harbors, fresh Lakes and Rivulets, pleasant
Fountains and Springs, some of which boyl in the Winter, and are cold
and delightful to drink in Summer. The Inhabitants never receive any
damage by Deluges; neither from the Sea, because the Water rises not
above a Foot; nor by the swelling Rivers, which sometimes, for a few
days covering the Plains, at their deserting them, leave them fat and
fruitful. The Sea-Coast is Hilly, and of a sandy and clayie Soil, which
produces abundance of Herbs and Trees.

[Sidenote: Trees.]

The Oak grows there generally sixty or seventy Foot high, and for the
most part free from Knots, which makes it the better fit for Shipping.

The Nut-trees afford good Fuel, and a strange Prospect when the Wood is
set on fire, either to hunt out a Deer, or to clear the Ground fit to be
Till’d.

Some Plants brought hither, grow better than in _Holland_ it self, as
Apples, Pears, Cherries, Peaches, Apricocks, Strawberries, and the like.

[Illustration: NOVUM AMSTERODAMUM]

[Sidenote: Vines.]

Their Vines grow wild in most places, and bear abundance of blue, white,
and Muskadine Grapes: Sometime since the Inhabitants made a considerable
advantage by the Wine of them, which is not inferior to either _Rhenish_
or _French_.

[Sidenote: Water Lemmons.]

All manner of Plants known in _Europe_ grow in their Gardens: The
Water-Lemmons, no less pleasing to the Palate than healthful when grown
ripe; they are about the bigness of an indifferent Cabbage: the
_English_ press a Juice out of them, which if it did not turn sowre in a
short time, might well be compar’d with _Spanish_ Wine.

The _Calabashes_ which grow there, made hollow, serve for Water-cups.

Pumpions are also there in great abundance.

[Sidenote: Wheat.]

Their Wheat though Set six Foot deep, grows very speedily: Kidney-Beans
being planted amongst it, they will wind about the Stalks thereof.

[Sidenote: Pease.]

Gray Pease grow here so fast, that they gather them twice a year.

In one Field Physical Herbs and _Indigo_ grow wild in great abundance;
and Barley springs above a Mans heighth.

Moreover, there are divers sorts of sweet-smelling Flowers.

[Sidenote: Soyl of the Mountains.]

The Hills are most of a fat and clayie Soil, fit to make Pots,
Tobacco-pipes, or any other sort of Earthen Ware.

[Sidenote: Gold and Silver-Mines.]

In some places also is store of Mountain Crystal, and that sort of
Mineral which we call _Muscovia Glass_: Others afford Marble, Serpentine
Stone, and other sorts of hard Stone. And though the Natives did not
think it worth their while, or were not in a capacity to dig for
Minerals themselves, yet it remains without contradiction, that the
Mountains inclose both Gold and Silver.

When Captain _William Clieff_, _Anno 1645._ us’d the _Indian_
Interpreter _Agheroense_ (to decide the Differences which arose between
the _West-India Company_ and the wild People call’d _Makwaes_,) he
observ’d him to paint his Face with a yellow glittering colour, which he
judg’d to be of some rich Mineral: whereupon buying some of the said
_Agheroense_, he put it into a Crusible, and gain’d two small pieces of
Gold out of the same, valu’d at six Shillings; but keeping it private,
and purchasing a great quantity of the said Mineral from _Agheroense_
(who had show’d him the Mountain which produced the same) extracted good
store of Gold out of it; which possessing _Clieff_ with a belief of
having found out a business of great consequence, he sent _Arent Corsen_
of _New-haven_ with the fore-mention’d Mineral to _Holland_; but the
Ship being never heard of afterwards, and the Princess Pink, in which
Captain _Clieff_ was himself, with store of the new-found Mineral, being
cast away, the Business came to nothing.

[Sidenote: Paint after a strange manner.]

The Inhabitants, though divided into several Nations, yet agree in many
things, as in painting their Bodies, Shields, Clubs, and other Utensils
in their Houses. The Colours wherewith they paint themselves they press
out of Plants, or make them of certain Stones grownd into very fine
Powder. The chiefest Plant is not unlike the Myrtle, onely it hath more
Boughs, and bears red Berries; the Juice of which being dry’d in the
Sun, is afterwards preserv’d in little Bags. The Natives temper their
Colours with Water, and paint their Bodies with the same: It is as good
a Purple as can be found. They also draw Ships, Trees, and Beasts after
a very rough manner: In stead of Feathers they wear pleited Hair, which
being colour’d red, hath an excellent gloss, which never fades though it
Rain on the same.

[Sidenote: Horses.]

The Horses bred in this Countrey, being either brought thither from
_England_ or _Utrecht_, far exceed those of _English_ breed; but are
both of them subject to a strange Disease, of which many die in few
hours. The same Distemper also seizes on Cattel if they go into Forrest
Pasture: But the onely thing to cure the same, is Hay from salt Marshy
Grounds.

[Sidenote: Hogs.]

The Oaken Woods have store of Hogs, which if taken and fatned with
_Turkish_ Wheat, are most delicious Meat.

[Sidenote: Sheep.]

The Sheep, though they breed well there, yet are very scarce, because
the Planters not being able to spare Men to watch them, they are often
devour’d by Wolves.

There are also abundance of Deer, all sorts of Fowls, Turkies, Geese,
Ducks, Pigeons, and the like.

[Sidenote: Lyons.]

The Lyons, whose Skins the _Indians_ bring to Market, are taken on a
high Mountain fifteen days Journey South-West from thence.

[Sidenote: Black Bears.]

There are likewise many black Bears, fearful of humane kind, but if
Hunted, they run direct on those that pursue them: they sleep all the
Winter, lying six Weeks on one side, and six on the other, and sucking
their Feet all the time: They generally lurk among Brambles, or in the
Concavities of some hollow Mountain.

[Sidenote: Strange Beasts.]

On the Borders of _Canada_ there is seen sometimes a kind of Beast which
hath some resemblance with a Horse, having cloven Feet, shaggy Mayn, one
Horn just on their Forehead, a Tail like that of a wild Hog, black Eyes,
and a Deers Neck: it feeds in the nearest Wildernesses: the Males never
come amongst the Females except at the time when they Couple, after
which they grow so ravenous, that they not onely devour other Beasts,
but also one another.

Towards the South of _New York_ are many Buffles, Beasts which
(according to _Erasmus Stella_) are betwixt a Horse and a Stag: though
they are of a strong Constitution, yet they die of the smallest Wound,
and are subject to the Falling-sickness: they have broad branchy Horns
like a Stag, short Tail, rough Neck, Hair colour’d according to the
several Seasons of the Year, broad and long Ears, hanging Lips, little
Teeth, and Skin so thick, as not easie to be pierced: The Females differ
from the Males, for they have no Horns; both may easily be made tame:
when Hunted, they vomit out a sort of scalding Liquor on the Dogs: they
have great force in their Claws, for they can kill a Wolf with the same
at one blow: their Flesh, either fresh or salted, is a good Diet: their
Claws also cure the Falling-sickness.

[Illustration]

[Sidenote: Harts.]

But no Beasts are more plentiful here than Harts and Stags, which feed
up and down in great Herds: when they are Hunted by Wolves or Men, they
immediately take the next River, where they are caught several together,
by being cross’d in their Swimming, and affrighted by the Eccho which
comes from the Mountains, made by the Hunters hollowing on the other
Shore, which makes them fearful of Landing: whilst the Huntsmen joyning
several pieces of Wood together get upon them, and Rowing towards these
Deer, intercept them, being tir’d and out of breath.

[Sidenote: Musk-Cats.]

Moreover, this Countrey breeds many Musk Cats, especially in Marshy
Grounds. These Beasts are beautiful to the Eye, having black speckled
Skins, their Mouths, full of sharp Teeth, and their Tails being long
trail after them.

Many of the Learned maintain a Dispute concerning Civet, Whether it be
the Seed of the Civet-Cat? the Affirmative, which _Cardanus_ maintain’d,
is contradicted by _Julius Scaliger_. _Matthiolus_, an Author of no
little credit, supposes that Civet is the Sweat of the Cat, because it
is most chiefly taken when these Beasts are exceedingly vex’d and
wearied: But since the Sweat runs from all parts of the Body, which
nevertheless do not all produce Civet, it is impossible that Sweat
should be Civet. Others account Civet to be the Dung of the Cats; which
last seems to come nearest to truth: for certainly it is nothing else
but an Excrement in the fleshy parts about their Pizzle, or near the
Fundament. The Cats being in pain to be discharg’d of this Civet, free
themselves from it by rubbing a Tree; and also fawn on those which take
it from them with a Spoon.

[Sidenote: _Plin._ lib. 32. cap. 3.]

Besides all other wild Creatures, the Countrey according to _Adrian
Vander Donk_, produces yearly eighty thousand Beavers. _Pliny_ relates,
that these Beasts bite off their Pizzles and throw them to the Hunter,
which are an exceeding good Medicine to help Abortion, stop the Monethly
Flowers, Giddiness in the Head, Gout, Lameness, Belly and Tooth-ach,
Rhumes, Poyson, and the Evil. But _Pliny_ makes a great mistake herein,
for the Beavers have a small Pissel fasten’d to their Back-bone, in such
a manner, that they cannot loose them but with hazard of their lives:
They live in the Water, and on the Shore, in great companies together,
in Nests built of Wood, which deserve no small admiration, being made
after this manner: The Beavers first gather all the loose Wood, which
they find along the Banks of the Rivers, of which, if there be not
enough, they bite the Bark off from the Trees in the neighboring Woods,
then with their Tusks, of which two grow above, and two below in their
Mouths, they gnaw the main body of the Tree so long, till it drops
asunder: Their Nests very artificial, are six Stories high, cover’d on
the top with Clay to keep out Rain; in the middle is a passage which
goes to the River, into which they run so soon as they perceive a Man;
to which purpose one of them stands Sentinel, and in the Winter keeps
open the Water from freezing, by continual moving of his Tail, which is
flat without Hair, and the most delicious Meat that can be had. The
Beavers go big sixteen Weeks, and once a year bring forth four young,
which suck and cry like young Children, for the Dam of them rises on her
hinder Feet, and gives her Teats, which grow between the fore-legs to
two of her young, each of them one; the foremost legs of a Beaver
resemble those of a Dog, the hindermost those of a Goose; on each side
of the vent are two swellings within two thin Skins; out of their vent
runs generally an Oily moysture, with which they anoint all the parts of
their body which they can reach, to keep them from being wet; within
they are like a cut-up Hog; they live on the Leaves and Barks of Trees;
they love their young ones exceedingly; the long Hairs, which shining,
stick out on the back, fall off in Summer, and grow again against
Harvest; they have short Necks, strong Sinews and Legs, and move very
swiftly in the Water, and on the Land; if incompass’d by Men or Dogs,
they bite most severely; the right _Castoreum_, so highly esteem’d by
Physicians, is a long _Vesica_, not unlike a Pear, within the body of
the female Beaver, the _Indians_ mince the Cods of the Male Beavers
amongst their Tobacco, because they produce no _Castoreum_.

[Sidenote: Fowls in _New York_.]

This Country abounds also with Fowls; for besides Hawks, Kites, and
other Birds of Prey, there are abundance of Cranes, of several sorts,
some grey, some brown, others quite white; all of them have firm Bodies,
and Bones without Marrow, Claws of a finger long, strong and crooked
Bills, their Brains dry, their Eyes little and hollow, hard Features,
the left Foot lesser than the right, both deform’d, their Blood thick,
and the Excrements of a horrid smell; they breed most in old Woods,
whose ground is without Brambles, and also near the Water, for they feed
on Fish, and devour all sorts of Fowls, nay, snatch up Hares, Rabbets,
Tortels, and several other sorts of Animals, which they carry away with
them in the Air; nay, when hungry, they seize on one another; some of
them fly abroad for their prey about noon, others at Sun-rising; they
fall like Lightning on what e’re they pursue; they drink little, except
the Blood of those Creatures which they devour; they are very
libidinous, coupling above thirty times a day, not only with their like,
but also with the Hens of Hawks, and other Birds; they lay their biggest
Eggs in thirty days, and the lesser in twenty days; they generally bring
forth three young; those of them that cannot endure to look full against
the Sun, are thrown out of their Nests; the young ones when they begin
to be fledg’d, are by the old carry’d into the Air, and let flie, but
supported by them; their sight is wonderful quick; for though they flie
as high as ever they are able to be discern’d, yet they can see the
least Fish that is in the Water, and a Hare lying in the Bushes: their
Breath stinks horribly, wherefore their Carcases suddenly rot; though
they are libidinous, yet they live long; most of them die of hunger,
because their Bills when they grow old, grow so crooked, that they
cannot open the same, wherefore they flie up into the Air against the
Sun, and falling into the coldest Rivers, loose their Feathers and die.

[Sidenote: Pigeons.]

Besides the foremention’d Birds of prey, there are abundance of Storks,
Ravens, Crows, Owls, Swallows, Gold-finches, Ice-birds, Kites, Quails,
Pheasants, and Winter _Kings_, and which are most remarkable for their
rich Feathers, the _Spechtes_, they pick great holes in Trees, and make
a noise as if a Man were cutting down a Tree. The Pigeons flie in such
flocks, that the _Indians_ remove with them to the place where they make
their Nests, where the young ones being taken by hundreds, serve them
for a Moneths Provision.

[Sidenote: Pretty Birds.]

Moreover, _New York_ breeds a strange Bird about a Thumb long, full of
glistering Feathers; it lives by sucking of Flowers like a Bee, and is
so tender, that it immediately dies if water be spirted upon it; the
Carcase being dry’d, is kept for a Rarity.

[Sidenote: Turkies.]

But this Countrey abounds chiefly in Turkies, whose plenty deserves no
less admiration than their bulk, and the delicious taste of their Flesh,
for they go feeding forty or fifty in a flock, and weigh sometime forty
or fifty pound apiece; the Natives either shoot them, or take them with
a Bait stuck on an Angle: In _March_ and Harvest the Waters swarm with
Geese, Teal, Snites, Ducks, and Pelicans, besides many strange sorts of
Fowls not known in _Europe_.

[Sidenote: Fish.]

The Rivers and Lakes produce Sturgeon, Salmon, Carps, Pearch, Barbils,
all sorts of Eels, and many other Fish which are taken near Water-falls:
The Sea affords Crabs with and without Shells, Sea-cocks, and Horses,
Cod, Whiting, Ling, Herrings, Mackrel, Flounders, Tar-buts, Tortels, and
Oysters, of which some are a Foot long, and have Pearl, but are a little
brownish.

[Sidenote: _Rattle-Snake._]

Amongst the Poysonous Creatures which infest _New York_, the chiefest
and most dangerous is the _Rattle-Snake_, whose description we have
already had at large in _New England_.

[Sidenote: Constitution of the Inhabitants.]

[Sidenote: Their Diet.]

The Inhabitants have their Hair black as Jet, harsh like Horse-hair;
they are broad Shoulder’d, small Wasted, brown Ey’d, their Teeth
exceeding white; with Water they chiefly quench their Thirst: Their
general Food is Flesh, Fish, and _Indian_ Wheat, which stamp’d, is
boyl’d to a Pap, by them call’d _Sappaen_: They observe no set time to
Eat, but when they have an Appetite their Meals begin. Beavers Tails are
amongst them accounted a great Dainty: When they go to Hunt, they live
several days on parch’d Corn, which they carry in little Bags ty’d about
their middle; a little of that said Corn thrown into Water swells
exceedingly.

[Sidenote: _Hudson_’s adventures remarkable.]

_Henry Hudson_ relates, That Sailing in the River _Montains_, in forty
Degrees, he saw the _Indians_ make strange Gestures in their Dancing and
Singing; he observ’d farther, that they carry’d Darts pointed with sharp
Stones, Sodder’d to the Wood; that they slept under the Sky on Mats or
Leaves; took much Tobacco, and very strong; and that though courteous
and friendly, they were very Thieves. He Sailing thirty Leagues further,
went in his Boat to an old _Indian_ Commander of forty Men and seventeen
Women, who conducted him to the Shore, where they all dwelt in one
House, artificially built of the Barks of Oak-trees; round about it lay
above three Ships load of Corn, and _Indian_ Beans to dry, besides the
Plants which grew in the Fields. No sooner had _Hudson_ enter’d the
House, but he was receiv’d on two Mats spread on the ground; and two Men
immediately were sent out to shoot Venison or Fowls; and instantly
returning, brought two Pigeons; a fat Dog, whom they nimbly flea’d with
shells, was also laid down to the fire: They also made other
Preparations for _Hudsons_ Entertainment, but not willing to venture
himself amongst them, that Night, tasted not of it, notwithstanding the
_Indians_ breaking their Darts, threw them into the fire, that thereby
they might drive away all fears and jealousies from him.

[Illustration]

[Sidenote: _New Netherlanders_ Apparel.]

The Habits of the Natives, especially of the Men, are few; the Women go
more neat than the Men; and though the Winter pinches them with
excessive cold, yet they go naked till their thirteenth year: Both Men
and Women wear a Girdle of Whale-fins and _Sea-shells_; the Men put a
piece of Cloth, half an Ell long, and three quarters broad, between
their Legs, so that a square piece hangs behind below his Back, and
another before over his Belly. The Women wear a Coat which comes half
way down their Legs, so curiously wrought with _Sea-shells_, that one
Coat sometimes costs thirty Pounds. Moreover, their Bodies are cover’d
with Deer-skins, the lappets or ends of which hang full of Points; a
large Skin button’d on the right Shoulder, and ty’d about the middle,
serves for an upper Garment, and in the Night for a Blanket: Both Men
and Women go for the most part bare-headed; the Women tie their Hair
behind in a tuft, over which they wear a square Cap wrought with
_Sea-shells_, with which they adorn their Foreheads, and also wear the
same about their Neck and Hands, and some also about their middle.
Before the _Hollanders_ were Planted here, they wore Shoes and Stockings
of _Buffelo_’s-skins; some likewise made Shoes of Wheaten-straw, but of
late they come nearer to our Fashions: The Men Paint their Faces with
several Colours; the Women only put here and there a black Spot; both of
them are very reserv’d.

[Sidenote: Their houses.]

[Sidenote: Remove.]

Their Houses are most of them built of one fashion, onely differing in
length; all of them agree in breadth of twenty Foot: They build after
this manner, they set Peel’d Boughs of Nut-Trees in the ground,
according to the bigness of the place which they intend to build, then
joyning the tops of the Boughs together, they cover the Walls and top
with the Bark of Cypress, Ashen, and Chest-nut-Trees, which are laid one
upon another, the smallest side being turn’d inwards: according to the
bigness of the Houses, several Families, to the number of fifteen dwell
together, every one having his Apartment. Their Fortifications are most
of them built on steep Hills, near Rivers; the access to them is onely
at one place, they are built after this manner: They set great Poles in
the Ground, with Oaken _Pallisadoes_ on each side, cross-ways one
amongst another; between the crosses they set other Trees, to strengthen
the Work: Within this inclos’d they generally build twenty or thirty
Houses, of which some are a hundred and eighty Foot long, and some less,
all of them full of People: In the Summer they pitch Tents along by the
River side to Fish; against Winter they remove into the Woods, to be
near their Game of Hunting, and also Fuel.

[Sidenote: Many Wives.]

[Sidenote: Marriages.]

[Sidenote: Whoring permitted.]

[Sidenote: Strange Marrying.]

[Sidenote: Child-bearing Womens strange actions.]

[Sidenote: Funerals.]

[Sidenote: Mourning over the dead remarkable.]

To take many Women is not customary here, only amongst Military
Officers, who Marry three or four Wives, which so well agree, that there
is never any difference betwixt them; those that are not of Age, never
Marry but with the consent and advice of their Parents: Widows and
unmarry’d Men follow their own opinion and choice; only they take
Cognizance of their Estates and Extraction: The Bridegroom always
presents the Bride; for the least offence, the Man after having soundly
beaten his Wife, turns her out of Doors, and Marries another, insomuch,
that some of them have every year a new Wife: On breach of Marriage, the
Children follow the Mother, from whom they account their Generation:
They account Adultery, if committed under the bare Canopy of Heaven, a
great Sin: Whoring is Licenc’d to single Women, if they receive Money
for it, and no Man scruples to Marry them; nay, those that are Marry’d,
boast how many they have enjoy’d before their Marriage: She that is
inclin’d to Marry, covers her whole body, and sets her self wrapt up in
the middle of the way, where a Batchelor passing by sees her, and makes
up the Match blindfold: When impregnated, they take great care that
their Fruit receives no hindrance nor prejudice: When the time of their
Delivery approaches, (which they know exactly) they go to a Melancholly
place in the Woods, though in the coldest Weather, where they raise up a
Hut of Mats, and bring the Child into the World without any help or
Company, wash the Child in cold Water, and wrap it up in Mats; then a
few days after going home, they bring up the Infant with great care,
none putting them out to Nurse: So long as a Woman gives suck, or is
quick with Child, she will not admit of Copulation; one who hath the
Flowers, never comes abroad: In time of sickness they faithfully assist
one another: When any die, the nearest Relations shut their Eyes; and
after having watch’d them some days, they are Interr’d after this
manner: The Corps is plac’d sitting with a Stone under its Head, near it
they set a Pot, Kettle, Dish, Spoons, Money, and Provisions to use in
the other World; then they pile Wood round about it, and cover it over
with Planks, on which throwing Earth and Stones, they set _Pallisadoes_,
and make the Grave like a House, to which they shew Veneration,
wherefore they account it a great piece of villany to deface any thing
of it: The Men make no shew of sorrow over the Dead, but the Women mourn
exceedingly, and carry themselves very strangely, beating their Breasts,
scratching their Faces, and calling night and day on the name of the
Deceas’d: The Mothers make great Lamentation at the Death of their
Children, especially Sons, for they shave off the Hair of their Heads,
which at the Funeral is burnt in the presence of all their Relations;
which is also perform’d by the Women when their Husbands die; besides,
they black all their Faces, and putting on a Hart-skin Shirt, mourn a
whole year, notwithstanding they liv’d very contentiously together.

[Sidenote: Conjurers.]

On some occasions they go a Worshipping of the Devil, to a certain place
where the Sorcerers shew strange Feats of Activity, tumbling over and
over, beating themselves, and not without great noise leaping in and
about a great Fire: at last they make a great Cry all together; upon
which (as they say) the Devil appears to them in the shape either of a
tame or wild Beast: the first signifies bad, and the other good fortune;
both inform them of future Events, though darkly; and if the business
fall out contrary, they affirm that they have not rightly understood the
Devil’s meaning. Moreover they bewitch some in such a manner, that they
foam at the Mouth, throw themselves into the Fire, and beat themselves
severely; and so soon as they whisper in the Ear of those whom they have
bewitch’d, they immediately recover their former health.

[Sidenote: Language of the _New Netherlanders_.]

The Language of this Countrey is very various, yet it is divided into
onely four principal Tongues, as the _Manhattans_, _Wappanoo_,
_Siavanoo_, and _Minqua_’s, which are very difficult for Strangers to
learn, because they are spoken without any Grounds or Rules.

[Sidenote: Money.]

Their Money is made of the innermost Shells of a certain Shell-fish,
cast up twice a year by the Sea: These Shells they grind smooth, and
make a Hole in the middle, cutting them of an exact bigness, and so put
them on Strings, which then serve in stead of Gold, Silver, and Copper
Coin.

[Sidenote: Vices and Vertues.]

[Sidenote: Strange Stoves.]

Now to say something of the Vices and Vertues of the Inhabitants. They
are in the first place very slovenly and nasty, stubborn, covetous,
revengeful, and much addicted to filching and stealing. Some appear
reserv’d, using few words, which they utter after serious consideration,
and remember a long time. Their Understandings being improv’d by the
_Hollanders_, they are quick of apprehension, to distinguish good from
bad: they will not endure any Oppression, but are very patient of Heat,
Cold, Hunger and Thirst. They have a strange way of using Stoves, which
are set in the Ground and cover’d with Earth, into which they go through
a little Door. A sick Person coming into the same, sets himself down,
and places hot Stones round about him; which done, and having sweat a
considerable time, he leaps into cold Water, by which he finds ease of
all his Distempers.

[Sidenote: Arms.]

[Sidenote: Remarkable actions of some Prisoners.]

[Sidenote: Laws.]

[Sidenote: Council-Assembly.]

Though these People know no great distinction between Man and Man, as
other Nations, yet they have noble and ignoble Families amongst them;
superior and inferior Offices, which they enjoy by Inheritance; but
sometimes the Martial Offices are bestowed according to the Valour of
the Persons: Their Generals seldom give their Enemies a Field-Battel, by
drawing or dividing their Men into Regiments or Companies, but make it
their whole Design to defeat their Enemies by sudden Sallies from
Ambuscado’s; for they never stand out a close Fight, unless compell’d to
it, but if encompass’d round, they fight to the last Man. When any
danger threatens, the Women and Children are convey’d to a secure place.
Their Arms formerly were Bowes and Arrows, and Battel-axes, but now they
use Musquets, which they have learn’d to handle with great dexterity.
Their square Shields cover all their Bodies and Shoulders. About their
Heads they tie a Snakes Skin, in the middle of which sticks either a
Fox’s or Bear’s Tail. They cannot be known by their Faces, they are all
over so besmear’d with Paint of divers colours. They seldom give Quarter
to their Enemies, except Women and Children, which the Conquerors use as
their own, that by that means they may increase and strengthen
themselves: and if any Prisoner is not kill’d presently after the
Battel, but falls into the Hands of one whose Relations have formerly
been slain by his Party, he is Roasted three days by degrees before he
gives up the Ghost. It deserves no small admiration, that the Sufferer
during the whole time of his Torture, Sings till he breathes his last.
They have few or no Punishments for any Offence, committing few Crimes
which are by them accounted Capital. If any one steal, and the Goods be
found in his custody, the Governor of the place where he resides
commands him onely to restore the same to the Owner. If any one murther
or kill the other, the Relations of the slain, if they can take the
Malefactor in twenty four hours, may without Examination or delay put
him to death also; but that time being once expir’d, the Revenger is
liable to be kill’d in the same time by his Relations whom he slew. All
Obligations have their power and vertue from certain Presents deliver’d
upon the making of a Contract, which is done thus: They dry as many
Sticks as they have Articles, which if they agree upon, every Man on the
concluding of the Discourse lays a Present before the others Feet.
Sometimes they hang up the Presents, because they are often three days
in Consultation before they resolve; after which if the Presents be
taken down, it is a certain sign of their Agreement; but if not, they
proceed no farther, unless the Articles and Presents are alter’d. On
Businesses of consequence the Commonalty repair to their Governor’s
House, there to hear and enquire what the Nobility there assembled have
concluded or resolv’d on; at which the best Orator standing up, tells
them their Intentions. It happens sometimes that a turbulent Person
making a Mutiny, and refusing to hearken to reason, is immediately
beheaded by one of the Nobility; in contradiction of which none dare
presume to speak the least word.

[Sidenote: Religion.]

[Sidenote: Diabolical Worship.]

[Sidenote: Their ridiculous Opinion of God.]

[Sidenote: As also of the Creation.]

There are scarce any steps of Religion found amongst these People, onely
they suppose the Moon to have great influence on Plants. The Sun, which
over-looks all things, is call’d to witness whene’re they Swear. They
bear great respect, and stand much in fear of _Satan_, because they are
often plagued by him when they go a Hunting or Fishing: wherefore the
first of what they take is burnt in honor of him, that he to whom they
ascribe all wickedness might not hurt them. When they feel pain in any
part of their Body, they say that the Devil sits in the same. They
acknowledge that there resides a God above the Stars, but troubles not
himself with what the Devil doth on Earth, because he continually
recreates himself with a most beautiful Goddess, whose original is
unknown: She on a certain time (say they) descended from Heaven into the
Water, (for before the Creation all things were Water) into which she
had instantly sunk, had not the Earth arose under her Feet, which grew
immediately to such a bigness, that there appear’d a World of Earth,
which produc’d all sorts of Herbs and Trees; whilst the Goddess taking
to her self a Hart, Bear, and Wolf, and Conceiving by them, she was not
long after deliver’d of several Beasts at one time: and from thence
proceeded not onely the diversity of Beasts, but also Men, of which some
are black, white, or sallow; in nature fearful like a Hart, or cruel and
valiant like a Bear, or deceitful like Wolves: after this the Mother of
all things ascended up to Heaven again, and sported there with the
Supream Lord, whom they say they know not, because they never saw him:
wherefore they shall have less to answer for than _Christians_, which
pretend to know him to be the Punisher of things both good and bad,
which are daily committed by them: and for this ridiculous Opinion they
can hardly be brought to embrace the _Christian_ Faith.

[Sidenote: Of the Immortality of the Soul.]

Concerning the Souls of the Deceased, they believe, that those which
have been good in their life-time, live Southward in a temperate
Countrey, where they enjoy all manner of pleasure and delight; when as
the Wicked wander up and down in a miserable Condition. The Eccho which
resounds from the Cries of wild Beasts in the Night, they suppose to be
the Spirits of Souls transmigrated into wicked Bodies.

[Sidenote: Their _Canticas_, or Dancing.]

At their _Canticas_, or Dancing-Matches, where all Persons that come are
freely Entertain’d, it being a Festival time. Their Custom is when they
Dance, for the Spectators to have short Sticks in their Hands, and to
knock the Ground and Sing altogether, whilst they that Dance sometimes
act Warlike postures, and then they come in painted for War with their
Faces black and red, or some all black, some all red, with some streaks
of white under their Eyes, and so jump and leap up and down without any
order, uttering many Expressions of their intended Valour. For other
Dances they onely shew what antick Tricks their ignorance will lead them
to, wringing of their Bodies and Faces after a strange manner, sometimes
jumping into the Fire, sometimes catching up a Firebrand, and biting off
a live Coal, with many such tricks, that will affright rather than
please an _English_-man to look upon them, resembling rather a company
of infernal Furies than Men.

[Sidenote: Their sitting in Council.]

When their King or _Sachem_ sits in Council, he hath a Company of Arm’d
Men to guard his Person, great respect being shewn him by the People,
which is principally manifested by their silence. After he hath declared
the cause of their Convention, he demands their Opinion, ordering who
shall begin: The Person order’d to speak, after he hath declar’d his
mind, tells them he hath done: no Man ever interrupting any Person in
his Speech, nor offering to speak, though he make never so many long
stops, till he says he hath no more to say. The Council having all
declar’d their Opinions, the King after some pause gives the definitive
Sentence, which is commonly seconded with a shout from the People, every
one seeming to applaud and manifest their Assent to what is determin’d.

If any Person be condemn’d to die, which is seldom, unless for Murther
or Incest, the King himself goes out in Person (for you must understand
they have no Prisons, and the guilty Person flies into the Woods) where
they go in quest of him, and having found him, the King shoots first,
though at never such a distance, and then happy is the Man that can
shoot him down; for he that hath the fortune to be Executioner, is for
his pains made some Captain, or other Military Officer.

They grease their Bodies and Hair very often, and paint their Faces with
several Colours, as black, white, red, yellow, blue, _&c._ which they
take great pride in, every one being painted in a several manner.

Within two Leagues of _New York_ lieth _Staten-Island_, it bears from
_New York_ West something Southerly: It is about twenty Miles long, and
four or five broad, most of it very good Land, full of Timber, and
producing all such Commodities as _Long-Island_ doth, besides Tin and
store of Iron Oar; and the _Calamine_ Stone is said likewise to be found
there: There is but one Town upon it, consisting of _English_ and
_French_, but it is capable of entertaining more Inhabitants.

Betwixt this and _Long-Island_ is a large Bay, which is the coming in
for all Ships and Vessels out of the Sea.

On the North-side of this Island _After-skull_ River puts into the Main
Land, on the West-side whereof there are two or three Towns, but on the
East-side but one. There are very great Marshes or Meadows on both sides
of it, excellent good Land, and good convenience for the setling of
several Towns. There grows black Walnut and Locust, as there doth in
_Virginia_, with mighty, tall, streight Timber, as good as any in the
North of _America_: It produceth any Commodity which _Long-Island_ doth.

_Hudson_’s River runs by _New York_ Northward into the Countrey, towards
the Head of which is seated _New Albany_, a Place of great Trade with
the _Indians_, betwixt which and _New York_, being above a hundred
Miles, is as good Corn-Land as the World affords, enough to entertain
hundreds of Families, which in the time of the _Dutch_ Government of
these Parts could not be setled by reason of the _Indians_, excepting
one Place, call’d _The Sopers_, which was kept by a Garrison, but since
the Reducement of these Parts under His Majesties Obedience, and a
Patent granted to his Royal Highness the Duke of _York_, which is about
six years, by the care and diligence of the Honorable Collonel
_Nichols_, sent thither as Deputy to his Highness, such a League of
Peace was made, and Friendship concluded betwixt that Colony and the
_Indians_, that they have not resisted or disturb’d any _Christians_
there, in the setling or peaceable possessing of any Lands within that
Government, but every Man hath sat under his own Vine, and hath
peaceably reap’d and enjoy’d the Fruits of their own Labors, which God
continue.

[Sidenote: _Raritan-River._]

Westward of _After-skull_ River before mention’d, about eighteen or
twenty Miles, runs in _Raritan_ River Northward into the Countrey some
scores of Miles; both sides of which River are adorn’d with spacious
Meadows, enough to feed thousands of Cattel: The Wood-Land is very good
for Corn, and stor’d with wild Beasts, as Deer, Elks, and an innumerable
multitude of Fowl, as in other parts of the Countrey. This River is
thought very capable for the erecting of several Towns and Villages on
each side of it, no place in the North of _America_ having better
convenience for the maintaining of all sorts of Cattel for Winter and
Summer Food.

Upon this River is no Town setled, onely one at the Mouth of it; but
next to it, Westward, is a Place call’d _Newasons_; where are two or
three Towns and Villages setled upon the Sea-side, but none betwixt that
and _Delaware-Bay_, which is about sixty Miles, all which is a rich
Champain Countrey, free from Stones, and indifferent level, having store
of excellent good Timber, and very well water’d, having Brooks or Rivers
ordinarily, one or more in every Miles travel. This Countrey is peopled
onely with wild Beasts, as Deer, Elks, Bears, and other Creatures, so
that in a whole days Journey you shall meet with no Inhabitants except a
few _Indians_. It is also full of stately Oaks, whose broad-branch’d
tops serve for no other use, but to keep off the Suns heat from the wild
Beasts of the Wilderness, where is Grass as high as a Man’s Middle,
which serves for no other end, except to maintain the Elks and Deer, who
never devour a hundredth part of it, than to be burnt every Spring to
make way for new. How many poor People in the World would think
themselves happy, had they an Acre or two of Land, whilst here is
hundreds, nay thousands of Acres that would invite Inhabitants.

[Sidenote: _Delaware-Bay._]

_Delaware-Bay_, the Mouth of the River, lieth about the mid way betwixt
_New York_ and the _Capes_ of _Virginia_.

The best Commodities for any to carry with them to this Countrey is
Clothing, the Countrey being full of all sorts of Cattel, which they may
furnish themselves withal at an easie Rate, for any sort of _English_
Goods, as likewise Instruments for Husbandry and Building, with Nails,
Hinges, Glass, and the like. They get a Livelihood principally by Corn
and Cattel, which will there fetch them any Commodities: Likewise they
Sowe store of Flax, which they make every one Cloth of for their own
wearing; as also Woollen Cloth, and Linsey-woolsey; and had they more
Tradesmen amongst them, they would in a little time live without the
help of any other Countrey for their Clothing; for Tradesmen there are
none but live happily there, as Carpenters, Blacksmiths, Masons,
Taylors, Weavers, Shoemakers, Tanners, Brickmakers, and so any other
Trade: Them that have no Trade betake themselves to Husbandry, get Land
of their own, and live exceeding well.

We shall conclude our Discourse of this Countrey with a notable
Character given thereof by a late Writer, as to the great advantage of
happy living in all respects, for whosoever shall be pleas’d to betake
himself thither to live.

[Sidenote: The Character of a happy Countrey.]

“If there be any terrestrial happiness (saith he) to be had by any
People, especially of an inferior rank, it must certainly be here. Here
any one may furnish himself with Land, and live Rent-free, yea, with
such a quantity of Land, that he may weary himself with walking over his
Fields of Corn, and all sorts of Grain, and let his Stock amount to some
hundreds; he needs not fear there want of Pasture in the Summer, or
Fodder in the Winter, the Woods affording sufficient supply, where you
have Grass as high as a Man’s Knees, nay, as high as his Waste,
interlac’d with Pea-Vines, and other Weeds that Cattel much delight in,
as much as a Man can pass through: And these Woods also every Mile or
half-Mile are furnish’d with fresh Ponds, Brooks, or Rivers, where all
sorts of Cattel, during the heat of the day, do quench their thirst, and
cool themselves. These Brooks and Rivers being inviron’d of each side
with several sorts of Trees and Grape-Vines, Arbor-like interchanging
places, and crossing these Rivers, do shade and shelter them from the
scorching beams of the Sun. Such as by their utmost Labors can scarcely
get a Living, may here procure Inheritances of Lands and Possessions,
stock themselves with all sorts of Cattel, enjoy the benefit of them
whilst they live, and leave them to their Children when they die. Here
you need not trouble the Shambles for Meat, nor Bakers and Brewers for
Beer and Bread, nor run to a Linnen-Draper for a supply, every one
making their own Linnen, and a great part of their woollen Cloth for
their ordinary wearing. And how prodigal (if I may so say) hath Nature
been to furnish this Countrey with all sorts of wild Beasts and Fowl,
which every one hath an interest in, and may Hunt at his pleasure;
where, besides the pleasure in Hunting, he may furnish his House with
excellent fat Venison, Turkies, Geese, Heath-hens, Cranes, Swans, Ducks,
Pigeons, and the like; and wearied with that, he may go a Fishing, where
the Rivers are so furnish’d, that he may supply himself with Fish before
he can leave off the Recreation. Here one may travel by Land upon the
same Continent hundreds of Miles, and pass through Towns and Villages,
and never hear the least complaint for want, nor hear any ask him for a
Farthing. Here one may lodge in the Fields and Woods, travel from one
end of the Countrey to another, with as much security as if he were
lock’d within his own Chamber: And if one chance to meet with an
_Indian_ Town, they shall give him the best Entertainment they have, and
upon his desire direct him on his Way. But that which adds happiness to
all the rest, is the healthfulness of the Place, where many People in
twenty years time never know what Sickness is; where they look upon it
as a great Mortality, if two or three die out of a Town in a years time.
Besides the sweetness of the Air, the Countrey it self sends forth such
a fragrant smell, that it may be perceiv’d at Sea before they can make
the Land: No evil Fog or Vapor doth any sooner appear, but a North-West
or Westerly Wind immediately dissolves it, and drives it away. Moreover,
you shall scarce see a House, but the South-side is begirt with Hives of
Bees, which increase after an incredible manner: So that if there be any
terrestrial _Canaan_, ’tis surely here, where the Land floweth with Milk
and Honey.”

                                   A
                            NEW DESCRIPTION
                                   OF
                               MARY-LAND.


                               SECT. III.

Before We proceed to the Description of this Countrey, it will be first
requisite to relate the true occasion and means, whereby this part of
_America_ came to be erected into a Province, and call’d _Mary-land_.

[Sidenote: The situation.]

In the Year of our Lord 1631. _George_ Lord _Baltemore_ obtain’d of King
_Charles_ the First, of _Great Brittain, &c._ a Grant of that part of
_America_, (first discover’d by the _English_) which lies between the
Degrees of thirty seven and fifty Minutes, or thereabouts, and forty of
Northerly Latitude; which is bounded on the South by _Virginia_; on the
North, by _New England_, and _New Jersey_, part of _New York_, lying on
the East side of _Delaware Bay_; on the East, by the Ocean; and on the
West, by that part of the Continent which lies in the Longitude of the
first Fountains of the River call’d _Patomeck_.

In pursuance of this Grant to his said Lordship, a Bill was prepar’d,
and brought to His Majesty to Sign, who first ask’d his Lordship, what
he should call it, there being a Blank in the Bill designedly left for
the Name, which his Lordship intended should have been _Crescentia_; but
his Lordship leaving it to His Majesty to give it a Name, the King
propos’d to have it call’d _Terra-Mariæ_, in _English_, _Mary-land_, in
honor of his Queen, whose Name was _Mary_; which was concluded on, and
inserted into the Bill, which the King then Sign’d; and thereby the said
Tract of Land was erected into a Province by that Name.

His Lordship somewhat delaying the speedy passing of it under the Great
Seal of _England_, dy’d in the _interim_, before the said Patent was
perfected; whereupon a Patent of the said Province was shortly
afterwards pass’d to his Son and Heir, (who was Christen’d by the Name
of _Cœcil_, but afterwards confirm’d by the Name of _Cœcilius_,) the now
Lord _Baltemore_, under the Great Seal of _England_, bearing Date _June
20. 1632._ in the eighth Year of His said Majesties Reign, with all
Royal Jurisdictions and Prerogatives, both Military and Civil in the
said Province, as Power to Enact Laws, Power of pardoning all manner of
Offences, Power to confer Honors, _&c._ to be held of His said Majesty,
His Heirs and Successors, Kings of _England_ in common Soccage, as of
His Majesties Honor of _Windsor_ in the County of _Berks_ in _England_;
yielding and paying yearly for the same to His Majesty and to His Heirs
and Successors for ever, two _Indian_ Arrows of those parts, at the
Castle of _Windsor_ aforesaid, on Tuesday in _Easter_ Week, and the
fifth part of all Gold and Silver Oar, which shall happen to be found in
the said Province.

[Sidenote: The Bounds.]

“By the said Patent is Granted to his Lordship, his Heirs and Assigns,
all that part of a _Peninsula_, lying in the parts of _America_, between
the Ocean on the East, and the Bay of _Chesapeack_ on the West; and
divided from the other part thereof by a right Line drawn from the
Promontory, or _Cape_ of Land call’d _Watkin’s-Point_, situate in the
aforesaid Bay, near the River of _Wigcho_ on the West, unto the main
Ocean on the East, and between that bound on the South, unto that part
of _Delaware Bay_ on the North, which lies under the fortieth Degree of
Northerly Latitude from the Equinoctial, where _New England_ ends; and
all that Tract of Land between the bounds aforesaid, that is to say,
passing from the aforesaid Bay call’d _Delaware Bay_, in a right Line by
the Degree aforesaid, unto the true _Meridian_ of the first Fountains of
the River of _Patomeck_; and from thence stretching towards the South,
unto the furthest Bank of the said River, and following the West and
South side thereof, unto a certain place call’d _Cinquack_, near the
Mouth of the said River, where it falls into the Bay of _Chesapeack_,
and from thence by a streight Line unto the aforesaid Promontory, or
place call’d _Watkin’s-Point_, which lies in thirty seven Degrees and
fifty Minutes, or thereabouts, of Northern Latitude.”

[Sidenote: Title.]

By this Patent his Lordship and his Heirs and Assigns are Created the
true and absolute Lords and Proprietaries of the said Province, saving
the Allegiance and Soveraign Dominion due to His Majesty, His Heirs, and
Successors; so that he hath thereby a Soveraignty Granted to him and his
Heirs, dependant upon the Soveraignty of the Crown of _England_.

[Sidenote: The first Seating.]

His Lordship, in the Year 1633. sent his second Brother Mr. _Leonard
Calvert_, and his third Brother Mr. _George Calvert_, with divers other
Gentlemen of Quality, and Servants to the number of two hundred Persons
at least, to settle a Plantation there; who set Sail from the _Cowes_ in
the _Isle of Wight_ in _England_, on _Novemb. 22._ in the same Year;
having made some stay by the way, at the _Barbadoes_ and _St.
Christophers_ in _America_, they arriv’d at _Point Comfort_ in
_Virginia_, on _February 24._ following; from whence shortly after they
Sail’d up the Bay of _Chesapeack_, and _Patomeck_ River. And having
review’d the Country, and given Names to several places, they pitch’d
upon a Town of the _Indians_ for their first Seat, call’d _Yoacomaco_,
(now Saint _Maries_) which the then Governor Mr. _Leonard Calvert_,
freely Purchas’d of the Natives there, for the Lord Proprietaries use,
with Commodities brought from _England_.

That which facilitated the Treaty and Purchase of the said place from
the _Indians_, was a resolution which those _Indians_ had then before
taken, to remove higher into the Countrey where it was more Populous,
for fear of the _Sansquehanocks_, (another, and more Warlike People of
the _Indians_, who were their too near Neighbors, and inhabit between
the Bays of _Chesapeack_ and _Delaware_) there being then actual Wars
between them, insomuch, that many of them were gone thither before the
_English_ arriv’d: And it hath been the general practice of his
Lordship, and those who were employ’d by him in the Planting of the said
Province, rather to purchase the Natives Interest, (who will agree for
the same at easie rates) than to take from them by force, that which
they seem to call their Right and Inheritance, to the end all Disputes
might be remov’d touching the forcible Incroachment upon others, against
the Laws of Nature or Nations.

[Sidenote: The number of Inhabitants.]

Thus this Province at the vast Charges, and by the unweary’d Industry
and endeavor of the present Lord _Baltemore_, the now absolute Lord and
Proprietary of the same was at first Planted, and hath since been
supply’d with People and other Necessaries, so effectually, that in this
present Year 1671. the number of _English_ there amounts to fifteen or
twenty thousand Inhabitants, for whose Encouragement there is a
Fundamental Law establish’d there by his Lordship, whereby _Liberty of
Conscience_ is allow’d to all that Profess to believe in _Jesus Christ_;
so that no Man who is a _Christian_ is in danger of being disturb’d for
his Religion; and all Persons being satisfi’d touching his Lordships
Right, as Granted by his Superior Soveraign, the King of _Great
Brittain_, and possess’d by the consent and agreement of the first
_Indian_ Owners, every Person who repaireth thither, intending to become
an Inhabitant, finds himself secure, as well in the quiet enjoyment of
his Property, as of his Conscience.

Mr. _Charles Calvert_, his Lordships onely Son and Heir, was in the Year
1661. sent thither by his Lordship to Govern this Province and People,
who hath hitherto continu’d that Charge of his Lordships Lieutenant
there, to the general satisfaction and encouragement of all Persons
under his Government, or otherwise concern’d in the Province.

The precedent Discourse having given you a short Description of this
Province from its Infancy to this day, together with an account of his
Lordships Patent and Right, by which he holds the same; we will here
speak something of the Nature of the Countrey in general, and of the
Commodities that are either naturally afforded there, or may be procur’d
by Industry.

The Climate is very healthful, and agreeable with _English_
Constitutions; but New-comers have most of them heretofore had the first
year of their Planting there in _July_ and _August_, a Sickness, which
is call’d there _A Seasoning_, but is indeed no other than an Ague, with
cold and hot Fits, whereof many heretofore us’d to die for want of good
Medicines, and accommodations of Diet and Lodging, and by drinking too
much Wine and Strong-waters; though many, even in those times, who were
more temperate, and that were better accommodated, never had any
_Seasonings_ at all; but of late years, since the Countrey hath been
more open’d by the cutting down of the Woods, and that there is more
plenty of _English_ Diet, there are very few die of those Agues, and
many have no _Seasonings_ at all, especially those that live in the
higher parts of the Country, and not near to the Marshes and Salt-water.

In Summer, the heats are equal to those of _Spain_, but qualifi’d daily
about Noon, at that time of the Year, either with some gentle Breezes,
or small Showres of Rain: In Winter there is Frost and Snow, and
sometimes it is extremely cold, insomuch, that the Rivers and the
Northerly part of the Bay of _Chesapeack_ are Frozen, but it seldom
lasts long; and some Winters are so warm, that People have gone in half
Shirts and Drawers only at _Christmas_: But in the Spring and Autumn,
(_viz._) in _March_, _April_, and _May_, _September_, _October_, and
_November_, there is generally most pleasant temperate Weather: The
Winds there are variable, from the South comes Heat, Gusts, and Thunder;
from the North or North-West, cold Weather; and in Winter, Frost and
Snow; from the East and South-East, Rain.

The Soyl is very fertile, and furnish’d with many pleasant and
commodious Rivers, Creeks, and Harbors.

The Country is generally plain and even, and yet distinguish’d with some
pretty small Hills and Risings, with variety of Springs and Rivulets:
The Woods are for the most part free from Underwood, so that a Man may
Travel or Hunt for his Recreation.

The ordinary entrance by Sea into this Country is between two _Capes_,
distant each from the other about seven or eight Leagues; the South
_Cape_ is call’d _Cape Henry_; the North, _Cape Charles_; within the
_Capes_ you enter into a fair _Bay_, Navigable for at least two hundred
Miles, and is call’d _Chesapeack Bay_, stretching it self Northerly
through the heart of the Countrey, which adds much to its Fame and
Value: Into this Bay fall many stately Rivers, the chief whereof is
_Patomeck_, which is Navigable for at least a hundred and forty Miles:
The next Northward, is _Patuxent_, at its entrance distant from the
other about twenty Miles, a River yielding great Profit as well as
Pleasure to the Inhabitants; and by reason of the Islands and other
places of advantage that may Command it, both fit for Habitation and
Defence: Passing hence to the Head of the Bay, you meet with several
pleasant and commodious Rivers, which for brevity we here omit to give
any particular account of: On the Eastern Shore are several commodious
Rivers, Harbors, Creeks, and Islands; to the Northward whereof you enter
into another fair Bay, call’d _Delaware Bay_; wide at its entrance about
eight Leagues, and into which falls a very fair Navigable River.

[Sidenote: The natural Commodities of the Countrey.]

This Countrey yields the Inhabitants many excellent things for Physick
and Chyrurgery; they have several Herbs and Roots which are great
Preservatives against Poyson, as _Snake-Root_, which presently cures the
bitings of the _Rattle-Snake_, which are very Venomous, and are bred in
the Countrey; others that cure all manner of Wounds; they have
_Saxafras_, _Sarsaparilla_, Gums and Balsoms, which Experience (the
Mother of Art) hath taught them the perfect use of.

An _Indian_ seeing one of the _English_ much troubled with the
Tooth-ach, fetch’d a Root out of a Tree, which apply’d to the Tooth,
gave ease immediately to the Party; other Roots they have fit for Dyers,
wherewith the _Indians_ Paint themselves as _Pacoone_ (a deep red,)
_&c._

The Timber of these parts is good and useful for Building of Houses and
Ships, the white Oak for Pipe-staves, the red for Wainscot; there is
likewise black Wall-Nut, Cedar, Pine, and Cypress, Chest-nut, Elme, Ash,
and Popelar, all which are for Building and Husbandry: Fruit-trees, as
Mulberries, _Persimons_, with several kind of Plumbs, and Vines in great
abundance.

Of Strawberries there is plenty, which are ripe in _April_, Mulberries
in _May_, Rasberries in _June_, and the _Maracok_, which is something
like a Lemon, is ripe in _August_. In Spring time there are several
sorts of Herbs, as Corn-sallet, Violets, Sorrel, Purslane, and others
which are of great use to the _English_ there.

In the upper parts of the Countrey are _Buffeloes_, _Elks_, _Tygers_,
_Bears_, _Wolves_, and great store of Deer; as also Beavers, Foxes,
Otters, Flying-Squirils, _Racoons_, and many other sorts of Beasts.

Of Birds, there is the Eagle, Goshawk, Falcon, _Lanner_, Sparrow-hawk,
and _Marlin_; also wild Turkies in great abundance, whereof many weigh
fifty Pounds in weight and upwards, and of Partridge great plenty: There
are likewise sundry sorts of singing Birds, whereof one is call’d a
_Mock-Bird_, because it imitates all other Birds; some are red, which
sing like Nightingales, but much louder; others black and yellow, which
last sort excels more in Beauty than tune, and is by the _English_ there
call’d the _Baltemore-Bird_, because the Colours of his Lordships Coat
of Arms are black and yellow: Others there are that resemble most of the
Birds in _England_, but not of the same kind, for which we have no
names: In Winter there are great plenty of Swans, Cranes, Geese, Herons,
Duck, Teal, Widgeons, Brants, and Pidgeons, with other sorts, whereof
there are none in _England_.

The Sea, the Bays of _Chesapeack_ and _Delaware_, and generally all the
Rivers, do abound with Fish of several sorts; as Whales, Sturgeon,
Thorn-back, Grampuses, Porpuses, Mullets, Trouts, Soules, Plaice,
Mackrel, Perch, Eels, Roach, Shadd, Herrings, Crabs, Oysters, Cockles,
Mussels, _&c._ but above all these, the Fish whereof there are none in
_England_, as _Drums_, _Sheeps-head_, _Cat-fish_, _&c._ are best, except
Sturgeon, which are there found in great abundance, not inferior to any
in _Europe_ for largeness and goodness.

The Minerals may in time prove of very great consequence, though no rich
Mines are yet discover’d there; but there is Oar of several sorts,
_viz._ of Tin, Iron, and Copper, whereof several trials have been made
by curious Persons there with good success.

The Soyl is generally very rich, the Mould in many places black and
rank, insomuch, that it is necessary to Plant it first with _Indian_
Corn, Tobacco, or Hemp, before it is fit for _English_ Grain; under that
is found good _Loam_, whereof has been made as good Brick as any in
_Europe_: There are store of Marsh-grounds for Meadows; great plenty of
Marle, both blue and white; excellent Clay for Pots and Tiles: To
conclude, there is nothing that can be reasonably expected, in a place
lying in the same Latitude with this, but what is either there found
naturally, or may be procur’d by Industry, as Oranges, Lemons, and
Olives, _&c._

[Sidenote: Commodities which are, or may be procur’d by industry.]

We need not here mention _Indian_ Corn, (call’d _Mayz_) Pease and Beans
of several sorts, being the peculiar products Planted by the _Indians_
of that part of _America_.

All sorts of _English_ Grain are now common there, and yield a great
encrease; as Wheat, Rye, Barley, Oats, Pease, Beans, _&c._ good Beer of
Wheat or Barley Malt, after the _English_ Mode, is made, even in the
meanest Families there; Some drink Beer of _Indian_ Corn, others of the
Stalks thereof, or of the Chipps of the _Pockykerry_-Tree, all which
make a sort of fresh and pleasant Drink; but the general Diet of the
Country is now _English_, as most agreeable to their Constitutions.

There are few able Planters there at present, but what are plentifully
supply’d with all sorts of Summer and Winter Fruits; as also of Roots
and Herbs, of all sorts out of their Gardens and Orchards, which they
have Planted for their Profit as well as Pleasure: They have Pears,
Apples, Plumbs, Peaches, _&c._ in great abundance, and as good as those
of _Italy_; so are their Mellons, Pumpions, Apricocks, Cherries, Figgs,
Pomegranates, _&c._ In fine, there is scarce any Fruit or Root that
grows in _England_, _France_, _Spain_, or _Italy_, but hath been try’d
there, and prospers well.

You may have there also Hemp, Flax, Pitch, and Tar, with little labor;
the Soyl is apt for Hops, Rape-seed, Annice-seed, Woad, Madder, Saffron,
_&c._ there may be had Silk-worms, the Country being stor’d with
Mulberry-trees, and the superfluity of the Wood will produce Pot-ashes.

There is a great quantity of Syder made there at present, and as good as
in any other Countrey; good Perry and Quince-drink is there likewise
made in great plenty: The Ground doth naturally bring forth Vines in
great quantities, the quality whereof being something corrected by
Industry, (as there have been several trials thereof already made there)
may no doubt produce good Wine, to the great encouragement and advantage
of the Undertakers.

Brave Ships may be built there with little charge, Clab-board, Wainscot,
Pipe-staves, and Masts for Ships, the Woods will afford plentifully;
some small Vessels have been already built there: In fine, Beef, Furrs,
Hides, Butter, Cheese, Pork, and Bacon, to Transport to other Countreys,
are no small Commodities, which by Industry, are, and may be had there
in great plenty, the _English_ being already plentifully stock’d with
all sorts of Cattel and Horses; and were there no other
Staple-Commodities to be hop’d for, but Silk and Linnen (the materials
of which apparently will grow there) it were sufficient to enrich the
Inhabitants.

But the general Trade of _Mary-land_ at present depends chiefly upon
Tobacco, it being the Planters greatest concern and study to store
himself betimes with that Commodity, wherewith he buys and sells, and
after which Standard all other Commodities receive their Price there;
they have of late vented such quantities of that and other Commodities,
that a hundred Sail of Ships from _England_, _Barbadoes_, and other
_English_ Plantations, have been usually known to Trade thither in one
Year; insomuch, that by Custom and Excize paid in _England_ for Tobacco
and other Commodities Imported from thence, _Mary-land_ alone at this
present, hath by his Lordships vast Expence, Industry, and Hazard for
many years, without any charge to the Crown, improv’d His Majesties, the
King of _Englands_ Revenues, to the value of Forty thousand Pounds
_Sterl. per annum_ at least.

The general way of Traffick and Commerce there is chiefly by Barter, or
Exchange of one Commodity for another; yet there wants not, besides
_English_ and other foraign Coyns, some of his Lordships own Coyn, as
Groats, Sixpences, and Shillings, which his Lordship at his own Charge
caus’d to be Coyn’d and dispers’d throughout that Province; ’tis equal
in fineness of Silver to _English Sterling_, being of the same Standard,
but of somewhat less weight, and hath on the one side his Lordships Coat
of Arms stamp’d, with this Motto circumscrib’d, _Crescite &
Multiplicamini_, and on the other side his Lordships Effigies,
circumscrib’d thus, _Cæcilius Dominus Terræ-Mariæ_, &c.

[Sidenote: The Government.]

The Order of Government and settled Laws of this Province, is by the
Prudence and endeavor of the present Lord Proprietary, brought to great
Perfection; and as his Dominion there is absolute (as may appear by the
Charter aforemention’d) so all Patents, Warrants, Writs, Licenses,
Actions Criminal, _&c._ Issue forth there in his Name: Wars, Peace,
Courts, Offices, _&c._ all in his Name made, held, and appointed.

Laws are there Enacted by him, with the advice and consent of the
General Assembly, which consists of two Estates, namely, the first is
made up by the Chancellor, Secretary, and others of his Lordships
Privy-Council, and such Lords of Mannors, and others as shall be call’d
by particular Writs for that purpose, to be Issu’d by his Lordship: The
second Estate consists of the Deputies and Delegates of the respective
Counties of the said Province, elected and chosen by the free voice and
approbation of the Free-men of the laid respective Counties.

The Names of the Governor and Council in this present Year 1671. are as
followeth, Mr. _Charles Calvert_, his Lordships Son and Heir, Governor;
Mr. _Philip Calvert_, his Lordships Brother, Chancellor; Sir _William
Talbot_ Baronet, his Lordships Nephew, Secretary; Mr. _William Calvert_,
his Lordships Nephew, Muster-Master-General; Mr. _Jerome White_,
Surveyor-General; Mr. _Baker Brooke_, his Lordships Nephew; Mr. _Edward
Lloyd_, Mr. _Henry Coursey_, Mr. _Thomas Trueman_, Major _Edward
Fits-Herbert_, _Samuel Chew Esq._

His Lordship, or his Lieutenant there for the time being, upon due
occasion, Convenes, Prorogues, and Dissolves this Assembly; but
whatsoever is by his Lordships Lieutenant there, with the consent of
both the said Estates Enacted, is there of the same Force and Nature as
an Act of Parliament is in _England_, until his Lordship declares his
dis-assent; but such Laws as his Lordship doth assent unto, are not
afterwards to be Alter’d or Repeal’d but by his Lordship, with the
consent of both the said Estates.

Their chief Court of Judicature is held at St. _Maries_ Quarterly every
Year, to which all Persons concern’d resort for Justice, and is call’d
_The Provincial Court_, whereof the Governor and Council are Judges: To
the Court there doth belong several sworn Attorneys, who constantly are
present there, and act both as Barristers and Attorneys; there are
likewise chief Clerks, Bayliffs, and other Officers, which duly attend
the Court in their respective places.

The Province is divided at present, so far as it is inhabited by
_English_, into Counties, whereof there be ten, _viz._ St. _Maries_,
_Charles_, _Calvert_, _Anne Arandel_, and _Baltemore_ Counties, which
first five lie on the West side of the Bay of _Chesapeack_; on the
Eastern side whereof, commonly call’d _The Eastern-Shore_, lies
_Sommerset_, _Dorchester_, _Talbot_, _Cæcil_, and _Kent Counties_, which
last is an Island lying near the Eastern-shore of the said Bay.

Besides the Provincial Court aforenam’d, there are other inferior
Courts, appointed to be held in every one of the Counties six times in
the year, for the dispatch of all Causes, not relating to Life or
Member, and not exceeding the value of three thousand weight of Tobacco;
the decision of all other Causes being reserv’d to the Provincial or
higher Court before-mention’d, and there lies Appeals from the
County-Courts, to the Provincial Court.

There are Sheriffs, Justices of the Peace, and other Officers appointed
by the Lord and Proprietary, or his Lordships Lieutenant for the time
being, in the said respective Counties; and without four Justices, of
which one to be of the _Quorum_, none of the said respective
County-Courts can be held; any of his Lordships Privy Council may sit as
Judge, in any of the said County-Courts, by vertue of his place.

These Courts are appointed to be held at convenient Houses in the said
Counties, which commonly are not far distant from some Inn, or other
House of Entertainment, for accommodation of Strangers; one of the said
six County Courts in each County is held for settling of Widows and
Orphans Estates.

There are Foundations laid of Towns, more or less in each County,
according to his Lordships Proclamation, to that effect Issu’d forth in
the year 1668. In _Calvert County_, about the River of _Patuxent_, and
the adjacent Cliffs, are the Bounds of three Towns laid out, one over
against _Point Patience_, call’d _Harvy Town_, another in
_Battel-Creek_, call’d _Calverton_, and a third upon the Cliffs, call’d
_Herrington_, and Houses already built in them, all uniform, and
pleasant with Streets, and Keys on the Water side. In the County of St.
_Maries_, on the East side of St. _Georges_ River, is the principal and
original Seat of this Province, where the general Assembly, and
Provincial Courts are held, and is call’d St. _Maries_, being erected
into a City by that Name, where divers Houses are already built: The
Governor hath a House there call’d St. _John_’s; the Chancellor Mr.
_Philip Calvert_, his Lordships Brother, hath another, and in this place
is built and kept the Secretaries Office, where all the Records are
kept, all Process, Grants, for Lands, Probates of Wills, Letters of
Administration are issu’d out: the Plat of a Fort and Prison is lately
laid there, upon a point of Land, term’d _Windmil-Point_, from a Windmil
which formerly stood there, the situation is proper, for that it
commands the breadth of the said River of Saint _Georges_; so that when
it is finish’d, all Shipping may safely Ride before the Town, without
the least fear of any sudden Assault, or Attempt of Pirats or other
Enemy whatsoever. This City has formerly been the usual place of abode
for his Lordships Lieutenants, and their Retinue; but of late years the
present Governor, Mr. _Charles Calvert_, hath built himself a fair House
of Brick and Timber, with all Out-houses, and other Offices thereto
belonging, at a place call’d _Mattapany_, near the River of _Patuxent_
before-mention’d, where he and his Family reside, being a pleasant,
healthful, and commodious Seat, about eight Miles by Land distant from
St. _Maries_.

[Sidenote: Of the _Indians_ in _Mary-land_.]

The _Indians_ in _Mary-land_ are a People generally of streight, able,
and well proportion’d Bodies, something exceeding the ordinary pitch of
the _English_, their Complexion Swarthy, their Hair naturally long and
black, without Curle, which generally they cut after some strange
Fantastical Mode; nay, sometimes they Dye it with red and other
preposterous Colours: They Liquor their Skins with Bears Grease, and
other Oyls, which renders them more tawny, and less apt to receive
injury from the Weather: They are subtile from their Infancy, and prone
to learn any thing their Fancy inclines them to, in other things
slothful.

There are as many distinct Nations among them as there are _Indian_
Towns, (which are like Countrey-Villages in _England_, but not so good
Houses) dispers’d throughout the Province: Each Town hath its King (by
them term’d _Werowance_) and every forty or fifty Miles distance differs
much from its Neighbors in Speech and Disposition: The _Sasquahanocks_,
though but few in number, yet much exceed the rest in Valor, and
Fidelity to the _English_; the rest being generally of a more
Treacherous Spirit, and not so stout, and the number of the _English_ do
already exceed all the _Indians_ in the Province.

The _Werowance_ is assisted by Councellors, call’d _Wisoes_, who are
commonly of the same Family, and are chosen at the pleasure of the
_Werowance_: They have Captains in time of War which they term
_Cockorooses_.

Most of their Governments are Monarchical, (except the _Sasquahanocks_,
which is a Re-publick) but for succession they have a peculiar Custom,
that the Issue of the Males never succeed, but the Issue-Male of the
Female succeed in Government, as the surer side: They all submit to, and
are protected by the Lord Proprietaries Government; and in case of any
Assault or Murder, committed on any _English_, the Party offending is
try’d by the Laws of the Province; and in case of any new Election of
King or Emperor among them, they present the Person so Elected to the
Governor for the time being, who as he sees cause, either alters or
confirms their Choice.

In the Year 1663. at the _Indians_ Request, the present Governor Mr.
_Charles Calvert_, and some others of his Lordships Privy-Council there,
went to _Pascatoway_, in this Province, to be present at the Election of
a new Emperor for that Nation: They presented a Youth nam’d
_Nattawasso_, and humbly Requested to have him confirm’d Emperor of
_Pascatoway_, by the Name of _Wahocasso_; which after some charge given
them in general, to be good and faithful Subjects to him, the Governor
accordingly did, and receiv’d him into his Protection.

They pay great Respect and Obedience to their Kings and Superiors, whose
Commands they immediately Execute, though with an apparent hazard of
their Lives.

The Mens chief employment is Hunting, and the Wars, in both which they
commonly use Bowes and Arrows; some of late have Guns and other Weapons,
by a private Trade with some _English_ Neighboring Plantations: They are
excellent Marks-men, it being the onely thing they breed their Youth to:
The Women Plant and look after the Corn, make their Bread, and dress
what Provisions their Husbands bring home. Their way of Marriage is by
agreement with the Womens Parents or Friends, who for a certain Sum of
their Money, or other Goods, deliver her to the Man at a day appointed,
which is commonly spent in jollity.

[Sidenote: Their Money.]

There are two sorts of _Indian_ Money, _Wampompeage_ and _Roanoack_,
these serve among them as Gold and Silver do in _Europe_, both are made
of Fish-shells, which they string like Beads; _Wampompeage_ is the
largest Bead, sixty whereof countervails an Arms length of _Roanoack_,
which is valued at six Pence _Sterling_; with this they purchase
Commodities of the _English_, as Trading-Cloth, _&c._ of which they make
themselves Mantles, which is something shaggy, and is call’d _Dutch
Duffels_; this is their Winter Habit; in Summer they onely wear a narrow
slip of the same to cover those parts, which natural modesty teaches
them to conceal; the better sort have Stockings made thereof, and pieces
of Deer-Skin, stitch’d together about their Feet in stead of Shooes: The
Womens Apparel is the same, but those of the best Quality among them
bedeck themselves with _Wampompeage_ or _Roanoack_, or some other toy.

[Sidenote: Manner of habitation.]

Their Houses are rais’d about the height of a large Arbor, and cover’d
with Barks of Trees very tite, in the middle whereof is the Fire-place,
they lie generally upon Mats of their own making, plac’d round the Fire,
a Woodden-bowl or two, an Earthen Pot, and a Mortar and Pestle, is their
chiefest Houshold-stuff; he that hath his Bowe and Arrows, or Gun, a
Hatchet, and a _Canoo_, (a term they use for Boats) is in their minds
rarely well provided for; each House contains a distinct Family, each
Family hath its peculiar Field about the Town, where they Plant their
Corn, and other sorts of Grain afore-mention’d.

[Sidenote: Civility to the _English_.]

They are courteous to the _English_, if they chance to see any of them
coming towards their Houses, they immediately meet him half-way, conduct
him in, and bid him welcome with the best Cates they have: The _English_
giving them in like manner civil Entertainment, according to their
Quality.

The _Werowance_ of _Patuxent_ having been Treated for some days at St.
_Maries_, by the then Governor, Mr. _Leonard Calvert_, his Lordships
Brother, at his first coming thither to settle that Colony, took his
leave of him with this Expression, _I love the_ English _so well, that
if they should go about to kill me, if I had so much breath as to speak,
I would Command my People not to revenge my death; for I know they would
not do such a thing, except it were through my own default._

In Affairs of concern, they are very considerate, and use few words in
declaring their intentions; for at Mr. _Leonard Calverts_ first arrival
there, the _Werowance_ of _Pascatoway_ being ask’d by him, _Whether he
would be content, that the_ English _should sit down in his Countrey?_
return’d this answer, _That he would not bid him go, neither would he
bid him stay, but that he might use his own discretion._ These were
their expressions to the Governor at his first entrance into
_Mary-land_, whom then they were jealous of, whether he might prove a
Friend or a Neighbor, but by his discreet Demeanor towards them at
first, and friendly usage of them afterwards, they are now become, not
only civil, but serviceable to the _English_ there upon all occasions.

The _Indians_ of the Eastern shore are most numerous, and were formerly
very refractory, whom Mr. _Leonard Calvert_ some few years after his
first settling the Colony, was forc’d to reduce, and of late the Emperor
of _Nanticoke_, and his Men were deservedly defeated by the present
Governor, Mr. _Charles Calvert_, who reduc’d him about the year 1668.
which has since tam’d the ruder sort of the neighboring _Indians_, who
now by experience, find it better to submit and be protected by the Lord
Proprietaries Government, than to make any vain attempt against his
Power.

These People live under no Law, but that of Nature and Reason, which
notwithstanding leads them to the acknowledgement of a Deity, whom they
own to be the Giver of all good things, wherewith their Life is
maintain’d, and to him they Sacrifice the first Fruits of the Earth, and
of that which they acquire by Hunting and Fishing: The Sacrifice is
perform’d by their Priests, who are commonly ancient Men, and profess
themselves Conjurers; they first make a Speech to their God, then burn
part, and eat and distribute the rest among them that are present; until
this Ceremony be ended, they will not touch one bit thereof; they hold
the Immortality of the Soul, and that there is a place of Joy, and
another of Torment after Death, prepar’d for every one according to
their Merits.

They bury their Dead with strange expressions of Sorrow (the better sort
upon a Scaffold, erected for that end) whom they leave cover’d with
Mats, and return when his flesh is consum’d to Interr his Bones; the
common sort are committed to the Earth without that Ceremony; but they
never omit to bury some part of their Wealth, Arms, and Houshold-stuff
with the Corps.


                               SECT. IV.
                               Virginia.

[Sidenote: Situation of _Virginia_.]

[Sidenote: First Discovery.]

The most Southerly part of _Virginia_ (for all that Tract of Land,
reaching from _Norumbega_ to _Florida_, and containing _New-England_,
_New-York_, _Mary-land_, and this part we are now about to Treat of, was
by Sir _Walter Rawleigh_ term’d _Virginia_, in Honor of our Virgin-Queen
_Elizabeth_) lies between _Mary-land_, which it hath on the North, and
_Carolina_, which it hath on the South, from thirty six, to near thirty
eight Degrees of Northern Latitude; and with the rest of those Countries
which were comprehended under the same Denomination, was by the
Encouragement, and at the Expence of the said Sir _Walter Rawleigh_,
first Discover’d (as some say) by Captain _Francis Drake_, for his many
notable and bold Exploits, afterwards Knighted by the Queen: But upon
examination we find little reason to ascribe the first Discovery thereof
to Sir _Francis Drake_, whose chief performances, from the time he first
made himself Eminent at Sea, were against the _Spaniards_, and for the
most part in the _Spanish-Indies_; as his taking of _Nombre de Dios_,
and _Vinta Cruz_, with an infinite mass of Treasure; his taking of
_Santo Domingo_ in _Hispaniola_, and of _Carthagena_ in _Castella Anna_;
and that which seems to have given occasion of attributing to him the
first Discovery of these parts, was his touching upon the North part of
the Isle of _California_, where being nobly Entertain’d by _Hioh_, a
King of that Countrey, and having a Surrendry thereof made to him, in
behalf of the Queen of _England_, he upon a Pillar erected, Inscrib’d
the Arms of _England_, with the Queens Name and his own, and call’d the
place _Nova Albion_: Certain indeed it is, that Sir _Walter Rawleigh_
was the first Promoter of this Discovery; for, after Mr. _Martin
Forbisher_ had been sent by Queen _Elizabeth_ to search for the
North-West Passage, which was in the year 1576. and for which he also
was by the Queen advanc’d to Knight-hood, and nobly rewarded; and Sir
_Humphrey Gilbert_ obtaining the Queens Letters Patents, for attempting
a Plantation, had reach’d _New-found-land_ (though perishing in his
return) he upon these Relations and Inducements undertook by others (for
his employments would not permit him to go in Person) to gain
Discoveries to the Southward; and accordingly in the year of our Lord
1584. obtain’d a Commission from the Queen, to discover and Plant new
Lands in _America_, not actually possess’d by any _Christians_, who,
with the assistance of Sir _Richard Greenvil_, and others, provided two
small Barques, under the Command of Captain _Philip Amidas_, and Captain
_Arthur Barlow_, who setting Sail the 27. of _April_, fell the 2^d of
_July_ following with the Coast of _Florida_, and made Discovery of the
Isle of _Wokokon_, _Roanoack_, and the Continent of _Wingandacoa_, which
they left; and arriving in _England_ about the midst of _September_
following, Her Majesty upon the relation of their Discoveries, was
pleas’d to call this Countrey _Virginia_.

[Illustration: NOVA VIRGINIÆ TABULA]

_April 9. 1585._ Sir _Richard Greenvil_, with seven Sail, and several
Gentlemen, left _Plymouth_; and on _May 26._ Anchor’d at _Wokokon_, but
made their first Seat at _Roanoack_ on _August 17._ following, which
lies in thirty six Degrees of Northerly Latitude, or thereabouts, where
they continu’d till _June 1586._ during which time they made several
Discoveries in the Continent and adjacent Islands; and being endanger’d
by the treachery of the Salvages, return’d for _England_, and Landed at
_Portsmouth_ on _July 27._ following.

Sir _Walter Rawleigh_ and his Associates, in the year 1586. sent a Ship
to relieve that Colony, which had deserted the Countrey some while
before, and were all return’d for _England_ as is before-mention’d.

Some few days after they were gone, Sir _Richard Greenvil_, with three
Ships, arriv’d at the Plantation at _Roanoack_, which he found deserted,
and leaving fifty Men thereto keep Possession of that Countrey, return’d
for _England_.

The year following, Mr. _John White_, with three Ships, came to search
for the fifty _English_ at _Roanoack_, but found them not, they having
been set upon by the Natives, and dispers’d so, as no News could be
heard of them, and in their room left a hundred and fifty more to
continue that Plantation.

In _August 1589._ Mr. _John White_ went thither again, to search for the
last Colony which he had left there; but not finding them, return’d for
_England_ in _Septemb. 6. 1590._

This ill Success made all further Discoveries to be laid aside, till
Captain _Gosnol_ on _March 26. 1602._ set Sail from _Dartmouth_, and on
_May 11._ following, made Land at a place, where some _Biscaners_, as he
guess’d by the Natives information, had formerly fish’d, being about the
Latitude of forty eight Degrees Northerly Latitude; from hence putting
to Sea, he made Discovery of an Island which he call’d _Marthas
Vineyard_, and shortly after of _Elizabeth_’s Isle, and so return’d for
_England_, _June 18._ following.

In the Year 1603. the City of _Bristol_ rais’d a Stock, and furnish’d
out two Barques for Discovery, under the Command of Captain _Martin
Pring_, who about _June 7._ fell with the North of _Virginia_ in the
three and fortieth Degree, found plenty of good Fish, nam’d a place
_Whitson-Bay_, and so return’d.

In the Year 1605. the Right Honorable _Thomas Arundel_ the first, Baron
of _Warder_, and Count of the _Roman_ Empire, set out Captain _George
Waymouth_, with twenty nine Sea-men, and necessary Provisions, to make
what Discoveries he could; who by contrary Winds, fell Northward about
one and forty Degrees and twenty Minutes of Northerly Latitude, where
they found plenty of good Fish; and Sailing further, discover’d an
Island, where they nam’d a Harbor, _Pentecost-Harbor_; and on _July 18._
following, came back for _England_.

In the Year 1606. by the sollicitation of Captain _Gosnol_, and several
Gentlemen, a Commission was granted by King _James_ of _Great Brittain_,
_&c._ for establishing a Council, to direct those new Discoveries;
Captain _Newport_ (a well practic’d Marriner) was intrusted with the
Transportation of the Adventurers in two Ships, and a Pinace, who on
_Decemb. 19. 1606._ set Sail from _Black-wall_, and were by Storm,
contrary to expectation, cast upon the first Land, which they call’d
_Cape Henry_, at the Mouth of the Bay of _Chesapeack_, lying in thirty
seven Degrees, or thereabouts, of Northerly Latitude: Here their Orders
were open’d and read, and eight declar’d of the Council, and impower’d
to chose a President for a year, who with the Council should Govern that
Colony: Till _May 13._ they sought a place to Plant in, Mr. _Winkfield_
was chose the first President, who caus’d a Fort to be rais’d at
_Powhatan_, now call’d _James-Town_: In _June_ following, Captain
_Newport_ return’d for _England_, leaving a hundred Men behind him;
since which time they have been sufficiently supply’d from _England_,
and by the indefatigable Industry and Courage of Captain _John Smith_,
(one of the Council at that time, and afterward President of the Colony)
they made several Discoveries on the Eastern shore, and up to the Head
of the Bay of _Chesapeack_, and of the principal Rivers which fall into
the said Bay.

_Virginia_ being thus Discover’d and Planted, King _James_ by his
Letters Patent bearing Date _April 10._ in the fourth year of his Reign,
1607. Granted Licence to Sir _Thomas Gates_, Sir _George Summers_, and
others, to divide themselves into two several Colonies, for the more
speedy Planting of that Countrey, then call’d _Virginia_, between the
Degrees of thirty four and forty five of North Latitude, that is to say,
taken in that large extent, mention’d in the beginning: The first Colony
to be undertaken by certain Knights, Gentlemen, and Merchants, in, and
about the City of _London_: The second to be undertaken, and advanc’d by
certain Knights, Gentlemen, and Merchants, and their Associates, in, or
about the City of _Bristol_, _Exon_, _Plymouth_, and other parts.

At the first Colonies Request, in the seventh year of the same King, a
second Patent was Granted to several Noblemen and Gentlemen, (including
Sir _Thomas Gates_, and some of his former Fellow-Patentees) bearing
Date _May 23. 1610._ whereby they were made a Corporation, and Body
Politique, and stil’d, _The Treasurer, and Company of Adventurers and
Planters of the City of_ London, _for the first Colony of_ Virginia: And
by this Patent, there was Granted to them, their Successors and Assigns,
two hundred Miles to the Southward, from a _Cape_ of Land in _Virginia_,
call’d _Point Comfort_; and two hundred Miles to the Northward of the
said _Cape_, along the Sea-shore, and into the Land from Sea to Sea.

And on _March 12. 1612._ the said King, in the ninth year of his Reign,
Grants them a third Patent, of all Islands lying in the Sea, within two
hundred Miles of the Shore of that Tract of Land on the Continent,
granted to them by the said former Patent, _Jac. 7._

In the Year 1615. Captain _Smith_ procur’d by his Interest at Court, and
the King’s Favor, a Recommendation from His Majesty, and divers of the
Nobility, to all Cities and Corporations, to Adventure in a standing
Lottery, which was erected for the benefit of this Plantation, which was
contriv’d in such a manner, that of 100000. Pounds which was to be put
in, 50000. onely, or one half was to return to the Adventurers,
according as the Prizes fell out; and the other half to be dispos’d of
for the Promotion of the Affairs of _Virginia_, in which, though it were
three years before it was fully accomplish’d, he had in the end no bad
Success.

In the eighteenth Year of the said King’s Reign, at the Request of the
second Colony, a Patent was Granted to several Noblemen and Gentlemen,
of all that Tract of Land lying in the parts of _America_, between the
Degrees of forty and forty eight of Northerly Latitude, and into the
Land from Sea to Sea, which was call’d by the Patent _New England in
America_: For the better Government whereof, one Body-Politick and
Corporate was thereby appointed and ordain’d in _Plymouth_, consisting
of the said Noblemen, Gentlemen, and others, to the number of forty
Persons, by the Name of _The Council establish’d at_ Plymouth _in the
County of_ Devon, _for the Planting, Ruling, Ordering, and Governing of_
New England _in_ America.

[Sidenote: The Patent of _Virginia_ made void.]

The Miscarriages and Misdemeanors of the aforesaid Corporation for the
first Colony of _Virginia_, were so many and so great, that His said
Majesty was forc’d, in or about _October 1623._ to direct a _Quo
Warranto_, for the calling in of that former Patent, which in _Trinity_
Term following was legally Evinc’d, Condemn’d, and made Void, by
Judgment in the Court of the then _Kings-Bench_; as also all other
Patents, by which the said Corporation claim’d any Interest in
_Virginia_. Thus this Corporation of the first Colony of _Virginia_ was
dissolv’d, and that Plantation hath been since Govern’d and Dispos’d of
by Persons Constituted and Impower’d for that purpose from time to time,
by immediate Commissions from the Kings of _England_.

[Sidenote: The Patent of _Mary-land_ granted to the Lord _Baltemore_.]

In the Year of our Lord 1631. the Right Honorable _George_ Lord
_Baltemore_ obtain’d a Grant of King _Charles_ the First of _Great
Britain_, _&c._ of part of that Land to the Northward, which is now
call’d _Mary-land_; but this Patent of _Mary-land_ was not perfected
till 1632. as you may understand more fully by the precedent Discourse
of _Mary-land_, which by express words in the said Patent is separated
from, and thereby declar’d not to be reputed for the future, any part of
_Virginia_.

[Sidenote: The Patent _Carolina_ granted to several Noble Persons.]

And in the fifteenth Year of the Reign of King _Charles_ the Second of
_Great Britain_, _&c._ on _March 24. 1663._ _Edward_ Earl of
_Clarendon_, then High-Chancellor of _England_, _George_ Duke of
_Albemarle_, _William_, now Earl of _Craven_, _John_ Lord _Berkley_,
_Anthony_ Lord _Ashley_, Sir _George Carterett_ Knight and Baronet, Sir
_William Berkley_ Knight, and Sir _John Colleton_ Knight and Baronet,
obtain’d a Patent from His Majesty, of the Province of _Carolina_, which
lies to the Southward of _Virginia_, in which is included some part of
that Land which formerly belong’d to the said dissolv’d Company of
_Virginia_. So that _Virginia_ at present extendeth it self onely, and
is situated between thirty six and thirty seven Degrees and fifty
Minutes, or thereabouts, of Northern Latitude, and is bounded on the
North, by _Mary-land_; on the South, by _Carolina_; on the East, by the
Ocean; and on the West, by the South-Seas.

[Sidenote: Rivers of _Virginia_.]

The Entrance by Sea into this Countrey is the same with that of
_Mary-land_, between _Cape Henry_ and _Cape Charles_, plac’d on each
side of the Mouth of the Bay of _Chesapeak_; on the West side whereof
you first meet with a pleasant and commodious River call’d
_James-River_, about three Miles wide at its Entrance, and Navigable a
hundred and fifty.

Fourteen Miles from this River Northward lies _York-River_, which is
Navigable sixty or seventy Miles, but with Ketches and small Barques
thirty or forty Miles farther.

Passing hence to the North you discover a third stately River, call’d
_Rappahanock_, which is Navigable about a hundred and thirty Miles—from
whence following the Shore to the North you enter into _Patomeck-River_,
which is already describ’d in the precedent Discourse of _Mary-land_, to
which Province this River belongs, whose Southerly Bank gives Bounds to
that part of _Virginia_ and _Mary-land_.

To these Rivers many other Inland Branches and Rivulets are reduc’d, the
chief of which are hereafter specifi’d.

[Sidenote: Nature of the Countrey.]

The Countrey is generally even, the Soil fruitful, the Climate
healthful, and agreeable with _English_ Constitutions, especially since
the increase of Inhabitants, and accommodation of good Diet and Lodging,
which the first Planters found great want of heretofore. For many years,
till of late, most New-comers had the first Year in _July_ and _August_,
a Disease which is call’d _A Seasoning_, whereof many died, like to what
is mention’d before in the Description of _Mary-land_, though more
mortal and common than in _Mary-land_, because _Virginia_ is a lower
Countrey, and somewhat hotter, insomuch that formerly divers ill of that
Distemper have come purposely from _Virginia_ to _Mary-land_, to recover
their Health; but now, since the Countrey is more open and clear from
Wood, few die of it, and many have no _Seasonings_ at all.

This Countrey affordeth generally all such Roots, Herbs, Gums, and
Balsoms, as are express’d before in the Relation of _Mary-land_.

[Sidenote: Trees]

All sorts of Trees for Building and Husbandry, Fruit-Trees, Vines, _&c._
are found in both Countreys, equal in goodness and quantity, onely in
such things as require more Sun, and that may be produc’d by Industry,
there may be some little difference, because _Virginia_ is somewhat more
to the Southward of _Mary-land_, as in Vines, Oranges, Lemmons, Olives,
Silk, _&c._

[Sidenote: Silk-Grass.]

There is a Plant grows naturally in this Countrey, and in _Mary-land_,
call’d _Silk-Grass_, which will make a fine Stuff with a silky Gloss,
and better Cordage than Hemp or Flax, both for strength and durance.

[Sidenote: Fruits peculiar to _Virginia_.]

The wild Beasts, Birds, and Fish, are much the same also in this
Countrey as are before describ’d in the precedent Description of
_Mary-land_: Nevertheless we shall think it proper not to omit some
Fruits, Plants, Beasts, _&c._ mention’d by the most authentick
Describers of _New England_, as peculiar to that Countrey. The Fruits
are, their _Putchamines_, which are a kind of Damsons; _Messamines_, a
kind of Grapes; _Chechinquamins_, a sort of Fruit resembling a Chesnut;
_Rawcomens_, a Fruit resembling a Goose-berry; _Macoquer_, a kind of
Apple; _Mettaquesunnauks_, a sort of Fruit resembling _Indian_ Figs;
_Morococks_, resembling a Straw-berry, besides a Berry which they call
_Ocoughtanamnis_, somewhat like to Capers.

[Sidenote: Roots.]

Their peculiar Roots are _Tockawaugh_, good to eat; _Wichsacan_, of
great vertue in healing of Wounds; _Pocones_, good to asswage Swellings
and Aches; _Musquaspen_, wherewith they Paint their Targets and Mats.
Also they have in great request a Pulse call’d _Assentamen_, and the
Plant _Mattouna_, of which they make Bread.

[Sidenote: Beasts.]

Their peculiar Beasts are, the _Aroughena_, resembling a Badger; the
_Assapanick_ or _Flying-Squerril_; _Opassum_, a certain Beast having a
Bag under her Belly, wherein she carrieth and suckleth her Young;
_Mussascus_, which smelling strong of Musk, resembleth a Water-Rat;
_Utchunquois_, a kind of wild Cat.

Their peculiar Fish are _Stingrais_.

[Sidenote: Rivulets.]

On the West side of the Bay of _Chesapeak_, between _Cape Henry_ and the
Southerly Bank of the River of _Patomeck_, are three fair Navigable
Rivers, as is before mention’d, into which the other small Rivulets
fall, which here we will give some account of, as also of the _Indian_,
or antient Names by which these three principal Rivers were formerly
known. The first whereof is _Powhatan_ (now call’d _James-River_)
according to the Name of a large and considerable Territory that lieth
upon it. The Rivers that fall into this Southward, are _Apamatuck_;
Eastward, _Quiyonycohanuc_, _Nansamund_, and _Chesapeak_; and Northward,
_Chickamahania_.

The second Navigable River is _Pamaunkee_, by the _English_ now term’d
_York-River_. The Rivulet that falls into this is _Poyankatanck_.

The third (which is before describ’d, and usually known by the Name of
_Rappahanoc_) was formerly term’d _Toppahanoc_.

This we thought fit here to insert, to the end no colour of mistake
might remain to after Ages concerning the derivation or original change
of such proper Names, especially being Places of great advantage to the
Colony.

[Sidenote: Several People of the ancient natives of _Virginia_.]

The chiefest of those Tribes or Divisions of People among the _Indians_,
that were by Name known to the _English_ at their first arrival, were
upon the River _Pouhatan_ the _Kecoughtans_, the _Paspaheges_, (on whose
Land is seated _James-Town_) the _Weanocks_, the _Arrohatocks_, the
_Appametocks_, the _Nansamunds_, the _Chesapeacks_, &c. On the River
_Pamaunkee_, are the _Youngtanunds_, the _Mattapaments_, &c. On the
River _Toppahanoc_, the _Manahoacks_, the _Moraghtacunds_, and the
_Cuttatawomens_. On the River _Patawomek_, the _Wighcocomocans_, the
_Onawmanients_, and the _Moyanances_. On the River _Pawtuxunt_, the
_Acquintacsuacs_, the _Pawtuxunts_, and the _Matapunients_. On the River
_Bolus_, the _Sasquesahanoes_: Southward from the Bay, the _Chawonocks_,
the _Mangoacks_, the _Monacans_, the _Mannahocks_, the _Masawomeks_, the
_Atquanahucks_, and the _Kuscarawaocks_, besides a number not material
to be nam’d, as having had little of Transaction that we hear of with
the Planters.

[Sidenote: Number of Inhabitants.]

The number of _English_ Inhabitants in this Country are in this present
Year 1671. about thirty or forty thousand, who are plentifully stock’d
with all sorts of tame Cattel, as Cows, Sheep, Horses, Swine, _&c._ and
all sorts of _English_ Grain; great store of brave Orchards for Fruit,
whereof they make great quantities of Cyder and Perry.

They have been much oblig’d by that worthy Gentleman Mr. _Edward
Digges_, Son of Sir _Dudley Digges_, who was Master of the Rolls, and a
Privy Councellor to King _Charles_ the First, of _Great Britain_, _&c._
For the said Mr. _Digges_ at his great Charge and Industry, hath very
much advanc’d the making of Silk in this Countrey, for which purpose he
hath sent for several Persons out of _Armenia_ to teach them that Art,
and how to wind it off the Cods of the Silk-worms; and hath made at his
own Plantation in this Colony for some years last past, considerable
quantities of Silk, which is found to be as good Silk as any is in the
World, which hath encourag’d divers others to prosecute that Work.

[Sidenote: The Commodities of _Virginia_.]

Though this Countrey be capable of producing many other good
Commodities, yet the Planters have hitherto imploy’d themselves for the
most part in Planting of Tobacco, as they do in _Mary-Land_; whereof
there are two sorts, one which is call’d _Sweet-scented_, and the other
call’d _Oranoack_, or _Bright and Large_, which is much more in
quantity, but of lesser price than the former; and the Plantations upon
_York River_ are esteem’d to produce the best of that sort of
_Sweet-scented_: There is so much of this Commodity Planted in
_Virginia_, and Imported from thence into _England_, that the Custom and
Excise paid in _England_ for it, yields the King about fifty or
threescore thousand Pounds _Sterling_, _per annum_: With this Commodity
the Planters buy of the Ships that come thither for it (which are above
a hundred Sail yearly from _England_, and other _English_ Plantations)
all Necessaries of Clothing, and other Utensils of Houshold-stuff, _&c._
which they want, though they make some Shoes, and Linnen and Woollen
Cloth in some Parts of _Virginia_, of the growth and Manufacture of the
Countrey; and if they would Plant less Tobacco (as it is probable they
will e’re long find it convenient for them to do, it being now grown a
Drug of very low value, by reason of the vast quantities planted of it)
they might in time provide themselves all Necessaries of Livelyhood, and
produce richer and more Staple-Commodities for their Advantage.

Their usual way of Trafique in buying and selling is by exchange of one
Commodity for another; and Tobacco is the general Standard, by which all
other Commodities receive their value; but they have some _English_ and
foreign Coyns, which serve them upon many occasions.

The Government is by a Governor and Council, Appointed and Authoriz’d
from time to time by immediate Commission from the King of _Great
Brittain_: And Laws are made by the Governor, with the consent of a
General Assembly, which consists of two Houses, an Upper and a Lower;
the first consists of the Council, and the latter of the Burgesses
chosen by the Freemen of the Countrey; and Laws so made are in Force
till His Majesty thinks fit to alter them.

The chief Court of Judicature is call’d _The Quarter-Court_, because it
is held every quarter of a Year, where all Causes Criminal and Civil are
heard and determin’d, and the Judges of this Court are the Governor and
Council: The present Governor in this Year 1671. is Sir _William
Berkley_, who was made Governor by King _Charles_ the First, of _Great
Brittain, &c._ in the Year 1640. And those of the Council are Sir _Henry
Chichesly_, who is one of the greatest and most considerable Planters
there, and Mr. _Edward Diggs_ before-mention’d, Mr. _Thomas Ludwel_
Secretary, Major-General _Robert Smith_, and divers other worthy
Gentlemen.

That Part of the Country where the _English_ are Planted, is divided
into nineteen Counties, _viz._ _Northampton-County_ in _Acomack_, on the
Eastern shore; and on the Western shore, _Corotuck_, _Lower-Norfolk_,
_Nansemund_, _Isle of Wight_, _Surry_, _Warwick_, _Henerico_, _James_,
_Charles_, _York_, _New-Kent_, _Glocester_, _Middlesex_, _Lancaster_,
_Northumberland_, _Westmoreland_, _Rappahanock_, and _Harford-Counties_.

In every one of these Counties there are inferior County-Courts kept
every Month; these take no Cognizance of Causes relating to Life or
Member, or exceeding a certain limited Value, such being refer’d to the
Quarter-Courts only, to which likewise there lie Appeals from their
Inferior Courts.

There are Sheriffs, Justices of the Peace, and other Officers in every
respective County, appointed by the Governor, for the Administration of
Justice, who sit there according to his Order, and whereof these
County-Courts are chiefly compos’d.

There are few Towns as yet erected in this Colony; the Principal Seat of
the _English_ there, is at a Place call’d _James-City_, in Honor of King
_James_ of _Great Brittain, &c._ This is situated in a _Peninsula_, on
the North-side of _James River_, and has in it many fair Brick and other
good Houses: In this place are held the Quarter-Courts, General
Assemblies, the Secretaries Office, and all other Affairs and greatest
Concerns of the Colony are here dispatch’d. On the same side, nearer the
Mouth of this River, stands _Elizabeth-City_, containing also several
good Houses of Brick and Timber.

Sir _William Berkley_, the present Governor resides at a place somewhat
distant from _James-City_, call’d _Green-spring_, a fair Brick House,
which he himself caus’d to be Built.

The other Towns of Note belonging to the _English_, are only
_Henricopolis_, or _Henry’s-Town_ (so nam’d from Prince _Henry_ then
living, built in a very convenient place, more within Land, about eighty
Miles distant from _James-City_) and _Dale’s-Gift_, so nam’d from Sir
_Thomas Dale_ Deputy-Governor of the Countrey, about the Year 1610.

The _Indians_ of _Virginia_ far exceed those of _Mary-land_, in
Treachery and Cruelty to the _English_ there, as will appear by this
following Relation of their Proceedings towards them, since the first
Seating of that Colony, wherein nevertheless, the Civility of some
particular Persons at their first Landing is not to be omitted.

[Sidenote: Transactions between the _English_ and the Natives.]

Upon the first arrival of Captain _Amidas_ and Captain _Barlow_ in
_Wingandacoa_, now _Virginia_, they were accosted by _Granganimeo_ (the
King’s Brother of that Countrey) who, attended with a Train of forty or
fifty Men, came in a very civil manner to Treat about a Commerce of
Trade and Traffique, which immediately began between them, and several
Barters were made: _Granganimeo_, who was very just of his word, and
always kept his promis’d Day of meeting, fancying most a Pewter Dish,
gave twenty Deer-skins for it, and boring a Hole therein, hung it about
his Neck for a Breast-plate; afterwards he, with his whole Company, and
his Wife and Children, frequently and familiarly did eat and drink
aboard the _English_ Ships, the King himself call’d _Wingina_, lying
sick at his chief Town, six days Journy off, of a dangerous Wound which
he had receiv’d from a neighboring King his mortal Enemy. Some of the
_English_ going to Land upon the Isle of _Roanoack_, were met by
_Granganimeo_’s Wife, who, her Husband being absent, commanded her
Servants some to draw their Boat ashore, some to carry them on their
Backs to Land, others to carry their Oars into the House for fear of
stealing; and having caus’d a great Fire to be made to warm them, and to
dry those that had been wet in their Voiage, she afterwards entertain’d
them with a plentiful Feast or Banquet after that Country fashion; and
when they took alarm at the coming of two or three of her Men with Bows
and Arrows, she caus’d the Bows to be broken, and the Men to be beaten
out of the House, besides several other demonstrations of extraordinary
civility; and when not withstanding all this they could not be perswaded
to Lodg any where but in their Boat, she us’d all means imaginable to
make them quit their Jealousy, and accept of a Lodging in the House.

In the Year 1585. a Company that went over with Sir _Richard Greenvil_,
burnt the Town of _Aquascogoc_, for a Silver Cup that was stoln by some
of the _Indians_, took Prisoner _Menatonon_, King of _Chawonoc_, who
gave Relation of a King about three days Journy off, who possess’d an
Island rich in Pearl, which was taken in a deep Water that inviron’d it.
Going towards the Countrey of the _Mangoacks_ (among whom in the
Province of _Chaunis Temaotan_, they heard of a Mine of strange Copper
call’d _Wassador_, with _Skiko_, the King of _Chawonock_’s Son, and
_Manteo_, a faithful Salvage, for their Guide) they were treacherously
dealt with by _Wingina_, alias _Pemissapan_ (for so, his Brother
_Granganimeo_ being lately dead, he had alter’d his Name) who endeavor’d
to stir up a Confederacy of the _Chawonocks_, _Moratocks_, and
_Mangoacks_ against them; yet by the urgent perswasions of _Ensenore_
his Father, the truest Friend the _English_ had, after the death of
_Granganimeo_, and seeing them safe return’d from their Journey, wherein
he thought they had all perish’d, and especially upon _Menatonon_’s
sending Messengers to them with Pearl, and _Okisco_ King of
_Weopomeock_, to yield himself Vassal to the Queen of _England_, his
Hatred was somewhat cool’d; but _Ensenore_ deceasing soon after, he
return’d to his old treacherous Practices again, and in the end, while
he was contriving Mischief against the Planters, he himself was shot,
taken Prisoner, and beheaded.

After the Company left upon _Virginia_ by Sir _Richard Greenvil_, (for
he himself was return’d) tir’d out with hunger, hardship, and the many
extremities they were at last reduc’d to, had deserted the Place, and
obtain’d passage for _England_, through the civility of Sir _Francis
Drake_, pitying their distress, fifty Men more were Landed upon
_Roanoack-Isle_, by the same Person, who how they were surpris’d and
destroy’d by the Natives, was discover’d at large to the Supply that was
sent over in the Year 1587. by Mr. _White_.

A small Party under Captain _Smith_ going down the River to
_Keconghean_, were very fiercely assaulted by sixty or seventy
_Indians_, but their Musquet-shot did such Execution amongst them, that
they fled into the Woods and left behind them the Image of their God,
which had been carry’d before them as their Standard, and not long after
sent one of their _Queiongcasocks_ to offer Peace, and to redeem their
_Okee_; which _Smith_ granting, on condition six onely of them would
come unarm’d and load his Boat with Provisions; and promising more over
to become their Friend, and furnish them with Beads, Copper, and
Hatchets: They accepted the Condition, and brought him Venison, Turkies,
wild Fowl, Bread, and what else they had, Singing and Dancing in sign of
Friendship till they departed.

In his next Voyage for the discovery of the Head of _Chickamahania_
River, he was, through the neglect of his Sea-men who were sent to watch
the Booty, taken Prisoner; in which condition he was kept a whole Month:
then being releas’d, he got Provisions for the People in _James-Town_;
which had they not timely receiv’d, they had all abandon’d the Place,
and return’d to _England_.

[Sidenote: King _Powhatan_.]

[Sidenote: _James-Town_ burnt.]

While Affairs stood thus in a mean condition, Captain _Newport_ arriving
there with a Ship and sixty Men to strengthen the Plantations, he went
to _Weromocomoco_, where King _Powhatan_ kept his Court, and found him
sitting on a Bed of Mats, and an Embroider’d Leather Cushion, Cloth’d in
Deer-skins; at his Feet sat a young Maiden, and on each side of the
House twenty Concubines; his Head and Shoulders painted red, and a Chain
of white Beads about his Neck. _Newport_ to oblige him, gave him an
_English_ Youth; for which he receiv’d _Powhatans_ Friend _Mamontak_;
with whom returning, he found a sad accident, for the Fire had not onely
burnt the Houses of the new Planters, but also the Pallisado’s about
_James-Town_, made for a Defence against the Enemies Assaults, and most
of their Store; which was so much the worse, because it hapned in the
Winter, and indeed had prov’d very fatal, had not a Ship, which was
suppos’d to be lost, happily arriv’d there with a considerable quantity
of Provisions.

[Sidenote: _Smith_’s Voyage.]

[Sidenote: His remarkable Exploits.]

Whilst the Town was rebuilding, _Smith_ set Sail in an open Barque with
fourteen Men, and discover’d two Isles before _Point Charles_, to which
he gave his Name; then ran into the Inlet _Chesapeack_, in the midst of
which lay several Islands, by the Sea-men call’d _Russels_. Before the
River _Wighcomoco_ they found a disturbed Sea, and more Northerly a Bay
with fresh and hot Water, and at last he met with two _Virginians_,
which conducted the _English_ along a Creek to _Onawmoment_, where some
hundreds of them lay in Ambuscade, according to _Powhatan_’s
appointment, to cut off _Smith_; who leaping forth on a sudden appear’d
like Devils, all painted; but the Bullets flying about made them all run
away. _Smith_, whose Design was onely to discover the Countrey, and the
Silver Mine of _Patawomeck_, ten Leagues up into the Countrey, found the
Metal to be of little value, so that he return’d with little Success,
being newly cur’d of a poysonous Wound in the Arm, which was given him
by a Fish not unlike a Shark, whilst he lay aground near _Toppahanock_.

A while after being inform’d of _Powhatan_’s Design to destroy the
_English_, (though he had been lately Presented by _Newport_ with a
Silver Basin, a rich Chair, Bed, and Furniture belonging to it, with
other things of value) he, to prevent him, chose forty eight out of two
hundred Men which were Garrison’d in _James-Town_, then going to
_Werowocomoco_, Landed with much trouble, the River being frozen above
half a Mile from the Shore.

A _German_ Soldier amongst _Smith_’s Company giving private notice to
_Powhatan_ of the Design of the _English_, made his Escape by flight:
But _Smith_ going on to _Pamaunke_, found King _Opechancangough_ with
seven hundred Men in Arms, threatning a fierce Battel; but _Smith_
making directly up to him, set his Pistol on his Breast, and forc’d him
to lay down his Arms. _Powhatan_ by this time provided with Swords and
Musquets by two _Dutch_-men, also began to bestir himself afresh; but
his Intentions being too soon known, he was again quieted, and forc’d a
second time to send _Smith_ a String of Pearl; after which a Peace was
concluded between all the Natives and the _English_.

Many other Quarrels and Encounters there were in the Infancy of the
Plantation between the _Indians_ and the _English_, wherein it would be
endless to recount all the Treacheries and Ambuscades of the Salvages,
some of which had prov’d very pernicious to the Planters, had they not
been betray’d to Captain _Smith_ by _Pocahonta_, King _Powhatan_’s
Daughter, who upon all occasions shew’d her self a great Friend to the
_English_, having sav’d the Captain’s Life, when, being her Father’s
Prisoner, he was just brought to Execution.

This Lady was afterwards brought into _England_, Christned by the Name
of _Rebekah_, and Married to one Mr. _Rolf_, and died at _Gravesend_ in
an intended Voyage back to her own Countrey.

Nor did their Cruelties and Treacheries end when the Plantation came to
be more setled, for on the two and twentieth of _March_ about the Year
1621. in the time of Sir _Francis Wyat_’s Government, they generally
combin’d to destroy all the _English_ there; and carried on this
devilish Design with such dissimulation and dexterity, that in one day
they cut off seven hundred Men, Women, and Children, there being at that
time not above fifteen hundred in the Countrey.

Since which time, in the Year of our Lord 1643. there hapned another
bloody Massacre, wherein near five hundred _English_ were in one Night
miserably butcher’d by those barbarous and perfidious Salvages: whose
Blood the present Governor, Sir _William Berkley_, nobly and justly
reveng’d the Year following, utterly destroying most of them, and taking
Prisoner their chief Emperor, _Opichancono_, who died not long after in
Prison.

Having given but a small hint, in its proper place, of the Story of
Captain _Smith_’s Imprisonment by _Powhatan_, and his deliverance from
Death by _Pocahonta_; we have thought not improper to reserve the Story
of it, being very remarkable for a particular Relation, before we
conclude our Description of _Virginia_, since otherwise we should have
interrupted the Series of our former Discourse.


 _The Relation of Captain_ Smith_’s being taken Prisoner by_ Powhatan,
   _and of his being deliver’d from Death by his Daughter_ Pocahonta.

The Salvages having drawn from one _George Cassen_, whither Captain
_Smith_ was gone, prosecuting that opportunity, they follow’d him with
three hundred Bowe-Men, conducted by the King of _Pamaunkee_, who in
divisions, searching the turnings of the River, found two of his Men by
the fire side, whom they shot full of Arrows, and flew. Then finding the
Captain, who, as is said, us’d the Salvage that was his Guide as his
Shield, (three of them being slain, and others sore gall’d) the rest
would not come near him: Thinking thus to have return’d to his Boat,
regarding them as he march’d, more than his way, he slipp’d up to the
middle in an Osier-Creek, and his Salvage with him, yet durst they not
come to him, till being near dead with cold, he threw away his Arms:
Then according to their composition, they drew him forth, and led him to
the Fire, where his Men were slain; diligently they chaf’d his benumm’d
Limbs, he demanding for their Captain, they shew’d him _Opechankanough_,
King of _Pamaunkee_, to whom he gave a round Ivory double compass Dyal.
Much they marvel’d at the playing of the Fly and Needle, which they
could see so plainly, and yet not touch it, because of the Glass that
cover’d them; but when he demonstrated by that Globe-like Jewel, the
roundness of the Earth, and Skies; the Sphere of the Sun, Moon, and
Stars, and how the Sun did chase the Night round about the World
continually; the greatness of the Land and Sea; the diversity of
Nations, variety of Complexions, and how we were to them _Antipodes_,
and many other such like matters, they all stood as amaz’d with
admiration: Notwithstanding, within an hour after they ty’d him to a
Tree, and as many as could stand about him prepar’d to shoot him; but
the King holding up the Compass in his Hand, they all laid down their
Bowes and Arrows, and in a triumphant manner led him to _Orapaks_, where
he was after their manner kindly Feasted, and well us’d.

Their order in conducting him was thus; Drawing themselves all in Fyle,
the King in the midst had all their Bowes and Swords borne before him.
Captain _Smith_ was led after him by three great Salvages, holding him
fast by each Arm; and on each side six went in Fyle with their Arrows
nocked. But arriving at the Town (which was but onely thirty or forty
Hunting Houses made of Mats, which they remove as they please, as we our
Tents) all the Women and Children staring and gazing at him, the
Souldiers first all in Fyle wheel’d off to the Rear in good Order; on
each Flank were Officers, like Serjeants to see them keep their
Postures: A good time they continu’d this Exercise, and then cast
themselves in a Ring, Dancing in such several Postures, and singing and
yelling out such hellish Notes and Screeches; being strangely Painted,
every one his Quiver of Arrows, and at his Back a Club; on his Arm a Fox
or an Otters-skin, or some such matter for his vambrace; their Heads and
Shoulders Painted red, with Oyl and _Pocones_ mingled together, which
Scarlet-like colour, made an exceeding handsome show; his Bowe in his
Hand, and the Skin of a Bird with her Wings abroad dry’d, ty’d on his
Head, a piece of Copper, a white Shell, a long Feather, with a small
Rattle growing at the Tails of their Snaks ty’d to it, or some such like
Toy. All this while _Smith_ and the King stood in the midst, guarded, as
before is said, and after three Dances they all departed. _Smith_ they
conducted to a long House, where thirty or forty tall Fellows did guard
him, and e’re long, more Bread and Venison was brought him than would
have serv’d twenty Men, I think his Stomack at that time was not very
good; what he left, they put in Baskets and ty’d over his Head. About
midnight they set the Meat again before him; all this time none of them
would eat a bit with him, till the next Morning they brought him as much
more, and then did they eat all the old, and reserv’d the new as they
had done the other, which made him think they would feed him for
slaughter: Yet in this desperate estate to fend him from the cold, one
_Maocassater_ brought him his Gown, in requital of some Beads and Toys
_Smith_ had given him at his first arrival in _Virginia_.

Two days after a man would have slain him (but that the Guard prevented
it) for the death of his Son, to whom they conducted him to recover the
poor man then breathing his last. _Smith_ told them, that at
_James-Town_ he had a Water would do it, if they would let him fetch it,
but they would not permit that; but made all the preparations they could
to assault _James-Town_, craving his advice, and for recompence he
should have Life, Liberty, Land, and Women. In part of a Tablebook he
writ his mind to them at the Fort, what was intended, how they should
follow that direction to affright the messengers, and without fail send
him such things as he writ for, and an Inventory with them. The
difficulty and danger, he told the Salvages, of the Mines, great Guns,
and other Engines, exceedingly affrighted them, yet according to his
Request they went to _James-Town_, in as bitter weather as could be of
Frost and Snow, and within three days return’d with an Answer.

But when they came to _James-Town_, seeing Men sally out as he had told
them they would, they fled; yet in the night they came again to the same
place where he had told them they should receive answer, and such things
as he had promis’d them, which they found accordingly, and with which
they return’d with no small expedition, to the wonder of them all,
supposing that he could either Divine, or the Paper could speak: then
they led him to the _Youthtanunds_, the _Mattapanients_, the
_Payankatanks_, the _Nantaughtacunds_, and _Onawmanients_ upon the
Rivers of _Rapahanock_, and _Patawomek_, through intricate ways, and
back again by divers other several Nations, to the Kings Habitation at
_Pamaunkee_, where they entertain’d him with most strange and fearful
Conjurations. Not long after, early in the Morning, a great fire was
made in a long House, and a Mat spread on each side thereof; on the one
they caus’d him to sit, and all the Guard went out of the House, and
presently there came skipping in a great grim Fellow, all Painted over
with Coal, mingled with Oyl; and many Snakes and Wesels-skins stuff’d
with Moss, and all their Tails ty’d together, so as they met on the
Crown of his Head in a Tassel; and round about the Tassel was a Coronet
of Feathers, the Skins hanging round about his Head, Back, and
Shoulders, and in a manner cover’d his Face; with a hellish voice, and a
Rattle in his Hand. With most strange gestures and passions he began his
Invocation, and environ’d the fire with a Circle of Meal; which done,
three more such like Devils came rushing in with the like antique
Tricks, Painted half black, half red; but all their Eyes were Painted
white, and some red strokes like _Mutchato_’s, along their Cheeks: round
about him those Fiends Danc’d a pretty while, and then came in three
more as ugly as the rest, with red Eyes, and white strokes over their
black Faces; at last they all sate down right against him, three of them
on the one hand of the chief Priest, and three on the other; then all
with their Rattles began a Song, which ended, the chief Priest laid down
five Wheat Corns, then stretching his Arms and Hands with such violence,
that he sweat, and his Veins swell’d, he began a short Oration: at the
conclusion, they all gave a short groan, and then laid down three Grains
more; after that, began their Song again, and then another Oration, ever
laying down so many Corns as before, till they had twice incircled the
Fire; that done, they took a bunch of little Sticks, prepared for that
purpose, continuing still their Devotion, and at the end of every Song
and Oration, they laid down a Stick between the Divisions of Corn: till
night, neither he nor they did either eat or drink, and then they
feasted merrily, with the best Provisions they could make: Three days
they us’d this Ceremony, the meaning whereof they told him, was to know
if he intended them well, or no. The Circle of Meal signifi’d their
Countrey, the Circles of Corn the bounds of the Sea, and the Sticks his
Countrey. They imagin’d the World to be flat and round, like a Trencher,
and they in the midst. After this they brought him a Bag of Gun-powder,
which they carefully preferv’d till the next Spring, to Plant as they
did their Corn, because they would be acquainted with the nature of that
Seed. _Opitchapam_, the King’s Brother, invited him to his House, where,
with as many Platters of Bread, Fowl, and wild Beasts, as did environ
him, he bid him wellcome, but not any of them would eat a bit with him,
but put up all the remainder in Baskets. At his return to
_Opechancanoughs_, all the Kings Women, and their Children, flock’d
about him for their Parts, as a due by Custom, to be merry with such
Fragments.

At last, they brought him to _Meronocomoco_, where was _Powhatan_ their
Emperor. Here more than two hundred of those grim Courtiers stood
wondering at him, as he had been a Monster; till _Powhatan_ and his
Train had put themselves in their greatest Braveries. Before a Fire,
upon a seat like a Bedsted, he sat cover’d with a great Robe, made of
_Rarowcun_-Skins, and all the Tails hanging by. On either hand did sit a
young Maid, of sixteen or eighteen years of Age, and along on each side
the House, two rows of Men, and behind them as many Women, with all
their Heads and Shoulders Painted red; many of their Heads bedeck’d with
the white Doun of Birds, but every one with something, and a great Chain
of white Beads about their Necks. At his entrance before the Emperor,
all the People gave a great shout. The Queen of _Appamatuck_ was
appointed to bring him Water to wash his Hands, and another brought him
a bunch of Feathers, in stead of a Towel to dry them: Having Feasted him
after their barbarous manner as well as they could, a long consultation
was held, but in conclusion, two great Stones being brought before
_Powhatan_, as many as could, laid Hands on him, dragg’d him to them,
and thereon laid his Head, when being ready with their Clubs, to beat
out his Brains, _Pocahontas_, the Emperors dearest Daughter, seeing no
intreaty could prevail, got his Head in her Arms, and laid her own upon
his to save him from death; whereat, the Emperor was contented he should
live to make him Hatchets, and her Bells, Beads, and Copper; for they
thought him a Man of all Occupations like themselves; for the King
himself will make his own Robes, Shoes, Bowes, Arrows, Pots, Plant,
Hunt, or do any thing as well as the rest.

[Illustration: A New _DISCRIPTION OF_ CAROLINA _By Order of the_ Lords
Proprietors]

Two days after, _Powhatan_ having disguis’d himself in the most fearful
manner he could, caus’d Captain _Smith_ to be brought forth to a great
House in the Woods, and there upon a Mat by the Fire to be left alone.
Not long after, from behind a Mat that divided the House, was made the
most doleful noise he ever heard; then _Powhatan_, more like a Devil
than a Man, with about two hundred more as black as himself, came unto
him, and told him, That now they were Friends, and presently he should
go to _James-Town_, to send him two great Guns and a Grindstone, for
which he would give him the Countrey of _Capahowosick_, and for ever
esteem him as his Son _Nantaquoud_. So to _James-Town_ with twelve
Guides _Powhatan_ sent him. That Night they Quarter’d in the Woods, he
still expecting (as he had done all this long time of his Imprisonment)
every hour to be put to one Death or other, for all their Feasting: but
Almighty God (by his Divine Providence) had mollifi’d the Hearts of
those stern _Barbarians_ with compassion. The next Morning betimes they
came to the Fort, where _Smith_ having us’d the Salvages with what
kindness he could, he shew’d _Rawhunt_, _Powhatan_’s trusty Servant, two
Demi-Culverins and a Milstone, to carry to _Powhatan_: they found them
somewhat too heavy; but when they saw him Discharge them, they being
loaded with Stones, amongst the Boughs of a great Tree loaded with
Isickles, the Ice and Branches came so tumbling down, that the poor
Salvages ran away half dead with Fear. But at last we regain’d some
Conference with them, and gave them some Toys, and sent to _Powhatan_’s
Women and Children such Presents, as gave them in general, full content.


                                SECT. V.
                               Carolina.

[Sidenote: Situation and Description of _Carolina_.]

_Carolina_ is that part of _Florida_ which lies between twenty nine and
thirty six Degrees and thirty Minutes of Northern Latitude: It is wash’d
on the East and South, with the _Atlantick_ Ocean; on the West with
_Mare Pacificum_, or the South Sea; and on the North, bounds on
_Virginia_. A Countrey wherein Nature shews how bountiful she can be
without the assistance of Art, the Inhabitants (excepting a little
_Maiz_ which their old Men and Women Plant) depending meerly on the
natural and spontaneous Growth of the Soil for their Provisions, the
Woods furnishing them with store of Fruit and Venison, and the Rivers
with plenty of several sorts of wholsom and savory Fish.

This Maintenance, which without forecast or toil they receive from the
natural fruitfulness of the Countrey, will, if we consider either the
largeness of their Growth, or the duration of their Lives, be thought
neither scanty nor unhealthy, their Stature being of a larger size than
that of _English_-men, their Make strong and well proportion’d, a
crooked or mis-shapen Person being not to be found in the whole
Countrey; and (where the chance of War, which they are almost
continually engag’d in one against another in their little Governments,
spares any of them) they live to an incredible old age; so that when the
_English_ came there, they found some of their Kings, who saw descend
from them the sixth Generation.

[Sidenote: Productions of the Soil.]

The Soil is very rich and fertile, producing naturally Walnuts, Grapes
(of which the _English_ who are there Planted have made very good Wine)
Apricocks, Bullys, with a multitude of others; besides the Woods also
are full of very good Peaches, and all the Season of the Year strew’d
all over with Strawberries. Mulberry-Trees are the common growth of the
Woods; and to assure you they are the natural Offspring of the Place,
and grow to an incredible bigness, one whereof the _English_ (who are
new Planted at _Albemarle Point_ on _Ashley_ River) made use to fasten
the Gate of their Pallisado to, was so large, that all who came from
thence say, they never saw any Oak in _England_ bigger, which is but the
ordinary size of the Mulberry-Trees of this Countrey, which is so sure
an Argument of the richness of the Soil, that the Inhabitants of
_Virginia_ enquiring of the Seamen who came from thence, concerning the
Quality and Product of the Countrey, when they were inform’d of the
large Mulberry-Trees it produc’d, were so well satisfi’d with it, that
they made no farther Enquiry. There are also other Trees, as Ash,
Poplar, and Bay, with several sorts unknown to us of _Europe_; but those
which make it almost all one general Forrest of large Timber-Trees, are
Oak, both red and white, and Cedar. There are also here and there large
Groves of Pine-Trees, some a hundred Foot high, which afford a better
sort of Mast than are to be had either in _Mary-Land_ or _Norway_. These
larger Trees weaving their luxuriant Branches into a close Shade, suffer
no Under-wood to grow between them, either by their Droppings, or else
the Heads of Deer which loosening all the tender Shoots, quite destroy
it; so that a great part of the Countrey is as it were a vast Forrest of
fine Walks, free from the heat of the Sun, or the incumbrance of Shrubs
and Bushes, and so clear and open, that a Man may easily ride a Hunting
amongst the Trees, yielding a Prospect very pleasant and surpassing. On
the Skirts of these Woods grow lesser Trees and Shrubs of several sorts;
amongst them are sundry Dying Materials, which how well the Inhabitants
know how to make use of, appears in the Deer-Skins that the chief of
them wear, which are Painted, or rather Dy’d, with several lively
Colours. But amongst their Shrubs, one of most note and use is that
whose Leaves make their _Casini_, a Drink they frequently use, and
affirm to be very advantageous for the preservation of Health; which, by
the description our _English_ give of the size, colour, and shape of the
Leaf, the sort of Tree it grows on, and the taste, colour, and effects
of the Drink, which is nothing but the Decoction of the Leaf, seems to
be the very same with the _East-India TEE_, and by those who have seen
and tasted both, affirm’d to be no other, and may very probably be a
spontaneous and native Plant of this Place, since those who give us an
account of it, tell us, that this so much valu’d Leaf grows most
plentifully in _Nanking_, a Province in _China_ under the very same
Latitude, and very much agreeing in Soil and Situation with this of
_Carolina_.

What Herbs else the Countrey produces, the _English_ Enquirers (who by
minding their Plantations and Settlement there, have been taken off from
such unprofitable Actions) give us but little account, onely they say,
that those Plats of Ground which have been formerly clear’d off by the
_Indians_ for the Planting their Corn, they found thick cover’d with
three-leav’d Grass and Dazies, which the fertility of the Soil thrusts
forth, whenever the Natives remove their Tillage to some other place,
and leave the Earth to its own production; and in other parts they found
plenty of Garden Herbs growing wild. The low and Moorish Grounds are for
the most part overgrown with Sedge and Reeds, and such other Trash,
which usually incumbers rich and uncultivated Lands; those they call
_Swamsas_, which with a little Husbandry would prove very good Meadows.
There are also some large and pleasant _Savanas_, or grassy Plains.

These are a part of the Trees and Plants best known to us, that Nature
of her self produces, in a Soil which contrives and nourishes any thing.
The _English_ who are now Planted in the most Northern parts of it, at
_Albemarle_, bordering on _Virginia_, have Apples, Pears, Cherries,
Apricocks, Plumbs, and Water-Melons, equalling, and if you will believe
the Inhabitants, both in largeness of size and goodness of taste,
exceeding any in _Europe_. And they who are Setled farther South on
_Ashley_ River, have found that the Oranges, Lemmons, Pomegranates,
Limes, Pomecitrons, _&c._ which they Planted there, have thriven beyond
expectation; and there is nothing which they have put into the Earth,
that through any defect in the Soil, hath fail’d to prosper.

[Sidenote: Commodities of the Countrey.]

Besides those things which do serve to satisfie Hunger, or provoke it,
the Land doth with great return produce Indigo, Ginger, Tobacco, Cotton,
and other Commodities fit to send abroad and furnish foreign Markets;
and when a little time shall have brought those kind of Plants to
maturity, and given the Inhabitants leisure to furnish themselves with
Conveniences for ordering those things aright, the Trials that they have
already made of the Soil and its fitness for such Plantations, assure
you, that besides Silk, enough to store _Europe_, and a great many other
considerable Commodities, they shall have as great plenty of good Wine
and Oyl, as any part of the World.

The Mould is generally black, mellow, and upon handling feels soft, and
(to use their Expression who have been there) soapy, and is generally
all over the Countrey just like the fine Mould of our well order’d
Gardens. Under this black Earth, which is of a good thickness in most
places that they have try’d, there lies a Bed of Marle, and in some
parts Clay.

[Sidenote: Fish and Water-Fowl.]

The Rivers are stor’d with plenty of excellent Fish of several sorts,
which are taken with great ease in abundance, and are one great part of
the Natives Provision, who are never like to want this Recruit, in a
Countrey so abounding in large Rivers, there being in that one small
Tract between _Port Rasal_ and _Cape Carteret_, which are not one Degree
distant, five or six great Navigable Rivers, that empty themselves into
the Sea. These Rivers are also cover’d with Flocks of Ducks and Mallard,
whereof millions are seen together, besides Cranes, Herons, Geese,
Curlews, and other Water-Fowl, who are so easie to be kill’d, that onely
rising at the discharge and noise of a Gun, they instantly light again
in the same place, and presently offer a fresh Mark to the Fowler. At
the Mouths of the Rivers, and along the Sea-Coast, are Beds of Oysters,
which are of a longer Make than those in _Europe_, but very well tasted,
wherein are often found good large Pearls, which though the unskilful
_Indians_ by washing the Oysters do commonly discolour, and spoil their
lustre, yet ’tis not to be doubted, but if rightly order’d, there will
be found many of value, and the Fishing for them turn to some account.

Besides the easie Provisions which the Rivers and Sea afford, their
Woods are well stock’d with Deer, Rabbets, Hares, Turtle-Doves,
Phesants, Partridges, and an infinite number of Wood-Pigeons and wild
Turkies, which are the ordinary Dishes of the _Indians_, whose
House-keeping depends on their Fishing and Hunting, and who have found
it no ill way of Living in so fertile a Countrey, to trust themselves
without any labor or forecast, to the Supplies which are there provided
to their hands, without the continual trouble of Tillage and Husbandry.
Besides, these Woods are fill’d with innumerable variety of smaller
Birds, as different in their Notes as Kinds.

[Sidenote: Temperature of the Climate.]

The Temperature of this Province is agreeable to a Countrey, whose
Position is on the warmer side of the temperate _Zone_, but yet the Heat
is not so sultry nor offensive, as in Places under the same Latitude in
the _Old World_; to which moderation of Heat, as well as the healthiness
of it, the vast _Atlantick_ Ocean, lying to the East and South of it,
may perhaps not a little contribute, an instance whereof some think
_China_ to be; to which deservedly admir’d Countrey _Carolina_ exactly
answers in its Position and Latitude, the trending from North-East to
South-West of its Coast, and the lowness of its Shore, and wants nothing
but Inhabitants, to make it equal, if not excell, in all conveniences of
Life, as it doth in richness of Soil, that flourishing Empire. The
healthiness of the Air is such, that it is not onely benign and
favorable to the home-bred _Indians_, and Constitutions accustom’d to
it, but the _English_-men who first Planted on _Ashley_ River, though
for some other Conveniences they Planted on the side, or almost middle
of a Morass, and were encompass’d with a salt Marsh, where the Air, pent
up with Woods that surrounded them, had not that freedom it hath in open
and cultivated Countreys, yet lost not in a whole years time, of a
considerable number, any one Person, of any Disease to be imputed to the
Countrey, those few that dy’d in that time sinking under lingring
Distempers which they brought with them, and had almost worn them out
before they came thither. The _Bermudians_ (who being accustom’d to the
pure Air of their own Island, cannot without hazard of their Lives put
themselves into any other Place) assur’d of the healthiness of this
Place, which is the next Land to them, and under the same Latitude,
venture hither. And generally all the _English_ Planting in the
_West-Indies_, are so taken with the Conveniences of this Countrey,
which, as some of the most considerable of the _English_ in those Parts
say of it, promises all that the Heart of Man can wish, that they send
the overplus of their People hither; to which the Inhabitants of
_Barbados_, a skilful and wary sort of Planters, well knowing in all the
parts of the _West-Indies_, have been found to remove the Hands they
could spare. As the Summer is not intolerably nor offensively hot, so
the Winter is not troublesom nor pinching, but enough to correct the
Humors of Mens Bodies, the better to strengthen them, and preserve their
Healths, and so far to check the growth of Plants, that by this stop
they may put out more regularly, and the Corn and other Fruits the
better ripen together, and be ready seasonably at the Harvest, the want
whereof in some Countreys hinders the beneficial Growth of several
valuable Commodities, the continual Spring all the year long making that
their Crops are never ready, their Trees being laden with green and ripe
Fruit at the same time, which is to be seen in the Vines growing between
the _Tropicks_, where, though they bear excellent Grapes, yet they
cannot make any Wine, whilest the mixture of ripe and sowre Grapes upon
the same Branch, renders them unfit for the Press, which from Grapes so
blended, though of a good kind, would squeeze out a very crude and
useless Liquor. This also is the reason why many Parts where our Wheat
will grow very well, do yet lose the benefit of it, whilest the several
Ears ripening unequally, never make the Crop fit for the Sickle. But
this Countrey hath Winter enough to remove that Inconvenience, and to
put such a stop to the Rise of the Sap, and the Budding of Plants, as to
make the several kinds of Fruits Bud and Blossom in their distinct
Seasons, and keep even pace till they are fit to be gather’d.

[Sidenote: Nature, Constitutions, and Manners of the Inhabitants.]

To this happy Climate the native Inhabitants are very well suited, a
strong, lusty, and well shap’d People, who to their well knit and active
Bodies, want not stout and vigorous Minds; they are a People of a good
Understanding, well Humor’d, and generally so just and Honest, that they
may seem to have no notice of, as their Language hath no word for,
Dishonesty and Cheating; and the worst Name they have for ill Men is,
that they are not good. They are a stout and valiant People, which
appears in the constant Wars they are engag’d in, not out of
covetousness, and a desire of usurping others Possessions, or to enrich
themselves by the Spoils of their Neighbors, but upon a pitch of Honor,
and for the glory of Victory, which is their greatest joy, there being
no parts of their Lives wherein they enjoy so much satisfaction, and
give themselves so wholly to Jollity, as in their Triumphs after
Victory. Valor therefore is the Vertue they most esteem and reward, and
he which hath behav’d himself well in the Wars, is suffer’d to wear the
Badges of Honor, and is advanc’d beyond others with some Marks of his
Courage; which amongst some is blacking the Skin below his Eyes with
black Lead, in fashion something of an Half-Moon; which Mark of Courage
is not suffer’d to be worn by any, but those who by some brave Action,
as killing the Enemy’s Leader, _&c._ hath signaliz’d himself in their
Encounters. They are faithful to their Promises, fair and candid in
their Dealings, and so far from Dishonesty, that they want even the
Seeds of it, _viz._ Forecast and Covetousness; and he will be very
little apt to deceive you to Day, who troubles not himself much about to
Morrow, and trusts for the Provisions of the Day to the Day it self;
which proceeds not in them for want of Wit, but desire of Content and
Quiet, or by the help of their natural Reason they enjoy that Happiness
which the Philosophers could not by their Study and Reading attain to,
whilest these Men cut off those Desires which Learning could never help
the other to Govern; and which if once permitted to run out beyond the
present, are capable of no Rest nor Bounds. In their Conversation they
are courteous and civil, and in their Visits make Presents to one
another; when they meet, their way of Salutation is stroaking on the
Shoulders, and sucking in their Breath; and if he be a great Man whom
they Salute, they stroak his Thighs too; as civil an Address, as those
Patterns of good Breeding, the Hero’s, us’d to their Princes, who in
their greatest Courtships, we are told, embrac’d their Knees: After
their Salutation they sit down; and it is usual with them to sit still
almost a quarter of an hour before they speak, which is not an effect of
stupidity or sullenness, but the accustom’d Gravity of their Countrey;
for they are in their Tempers a merry, frollick, gay People, and so
given to Jollity, that they will Dance whole Nights together, the Women
sitting by and Singing, whilest the Men Dance to their Ayrs, which
though not like ours, are not harsh or unpleasing, but are something
like the Tunes of the _Irish_: So that if we will not let our selves too
fondly admire onely the Customs we have been bred up in, nor think Men
are to be valu’d for making Legs after our Mode, or the Clothes they
wear, which, the finer and gayer they are, always the more to be
suspected of Luxury and Effeminateness; if we will allow but these Men
to follow the Garbs of their own Countrey, and think them fine enough in
a shape onely to hide their Nakedness before, or a Deer-skin hanging
loosely on their Shoulders, and their Women not ill Dress’d in Garments
of Moss, and Necklaces of Beads, whilest the Fashion of their Courts
require no other Ornaments; if, I say, a long and pleasant Life, without
Distemper or Care, be to be valu’d, without the incumbrance of
unnecessary Trinkets; if Men are to be esteem’d for Valor, Honesty,
Friendship, Humanity and good Nature, though Strangers to the
ceremonious Troubles we are accustom’d to, the Natives of _Carolina_
will as little, or perhaps less, deserve the Name of _Miserable_, or
_Salvage_, as those that give it them. ’Tis true, the _French_ and
_Spaniards_ who have Planted amongst them, or with little Armies
travell’d their Countrey, have been ill handled by them; but yet the
_Indians_ never did them any harm, or treated them otherwise than
Friends, till those _Europeans_ by their breach of Faith and several
Outrages, had provok’d their just Revenge; and they did nothing but what
most virtuous and generous sort of Men are apt to do, to revenge those
Affronts, which did not agree with their Tempers tamely to endure. That
this did not proceed from treachery and inconstancy in their Natures, is
apparent in the contrary Correspondence they have had with the _English_
Setled amongst them, to whom they have been all along very kind, as they
were at first very covetous of their Company; for after that some of
their King’s Relation had been at _Barbados_, and had seen and admir’d
the Temper, Fashions and Strength of the _English_ there, and had been
very civilly Treated in that Island, they were so well satisfi’d with
them, that at the coming of the _English_ to Settle there, the several
little Kingdoms strove with all the Arts and Arguments they could use,
each of them to draw the _English_ to Plant in their Dominions, by
commending the richness of their Soil, conveniency of their Rivers, the
healthiness of their Countrey, the disparagement of their Neighbors, and
whatever else they judg’d might allure the _English_ to their
Neighborhood. Nor was this onely the first heat of Men fond of
Novelties, and as soon weary of them again, but ever since the _English_
first Planted at _Albemarle Point_, on _Ashley_ River, they have
continu’d to do them all manner of friendly Offices, ready on all
occasions to supply them with any thing they have observ’d them to want,
not making use of our Mens Necessities, as an opportunity to enhance the
Price of their Commodities, a sort of fair Dealing we could scarce have
promis’d them amongst civiliz’d, well bred, and religious Inhabitants of
any part of _Europe_; and though they are much frighted with our Guns,
both small and great, yet like innocent and well-meaning People, they do
not at all distrust our Power, but freely, without suspicion, trust
themselves, both Men and Women, even their Kings themselves, in our
Town, Lodging and Dancing there frequently whole Nights together, upon
no other Pledges but the bare confidence of our mutual Friendship; nor
do our Men use any greater caution in Conversing with them, stragling up
and down, and travelling singly and unarm’d through their Woods for many
Miles about, and are so far from receiving any injury or ill treatment
from them, that on the contrary they are kindly us’d and Entertain’d,
and guided by them in their Way whenever they desire it; and when any of
our Men meet them in their Walks, the _Indians_ all stand still till
they are gone by, civilly Saluting them as they pass. Nor doth this
Assurance of theirs bound it self within their own Homes, they of their
own accords venturing themselves aboard our Ships, have gone voluntarily
with our Men to _Virginia_ and _Barbados_. Nor have the _English_ been
wanting on their parts in any thing that may preserve this Amity, being
very cautious of doing them any injury, bartering with them for those
things they receive of them, and buying of them even the waste Land they
make no use of.

Besides the simplicity of the _Indians_ Diet, it is very remarkable,
that they have a general aversion to those two things which are most
acceptable to our Palates, and without which few of us either eat or
drink with any delight; for in their Meats they cannot endure the least
mixture or rellish of Salt; and for their Drink, they utterly abominate
all manner of strong Liquor; to the latter whereof, their large Growth
and constant Health, is perhaps not a little owing.

[Sidenote: Their manner of Government.]

Every little Town is a distinct Principality, Govern’d by an Hereditary
King, who in some places is not Son, but Sisters Son to the precedent
King, the Succession of the Blood-Royal being continu’d by the safer
side. The great Business of those Princes is to lead their Men out
against their Enemies in War, or against the Beasts in Hunting; for
unless it be to appoint them where to Hunt, or else to Consult about
making some Attempt upon their Enemy, he hath but small trouble in the
Government of his Subjects, who either through their own Honesty, or the
few occasions they have for Controversies in their _extempore_ way of
Living, need few Laws, and little Severity to keep them in order; but
yet they Govern their People without Contract, and fail not of a ready
Obedience to their Commands; so that when some of them have bought
things of such of the _English_, who by the Orders made amongst our
selves were not to Traffick with the _Indians_, they have, upon
Complaint made to their _Casiques_, been restor’d again, though in
strict Rules of Law they were neither bound by, nor oblig’d to take
notice of the Rules which were made onely to Govern our own People, and
had at just Prices bought what they carry’d away; such is the Honesty of
Men, whose Principles not being corrupted with Learning and Distinction,
are contented to follow the Dictates of right Reason, which Nature has
sufficiently taught all Men for the well ordering of their Actions, and
enjoyment and preservation of humane Society, who do not give themselves
up to be amus’d and deceiv’d by insignificant Terms, and minding what is
just and right, seek not Evasions in the Niceties and Fallacies of
Words.

[Sidenote: _Carolina_ granted by Patent to several Noble Persons by His
           Majesty.]

The same is to be said of the first Discovery of this Countrey, as hath
been formerly said of _Virginia_ and _Florida_, of both which it
partakes; but as to the present Interest and Propriety, the _English_,
besides all _Virginia_ intirely, have also so much of _Florida_ as makes
up this considerable Province of _Carolina_, which soon after the happy
Restauration of His present Majesty King _Charles_ II. from whom it
receives Denomination, was granted by Patent to _Edward_ Earl of
_Clarendon_, L. Chancellor of _England_, _George_ Duke of _Albemarle_,
_William_ Earl of _Craven_, _John_ Lord _Berkley_, _Anthony_ Lord
_Ashley_, Sir _George Carteret_, Vice-Chamberlain of His Majesty’s
Houshold, Sir _William Berkley_, Knight and Baronet, and Sir _John
Colleton_, Knight and Baronet.

[Sidenote: Their care for Setling and Improving of this Plantation.]

The Lords-Proprietors of this Countrey, for the better Settlement of it
according to their Patent granted unto them by His Majesty, and for the
enlargement of the King’s Dominions in those parts of _America_, have
been at great Charge to secure this so rich and advantageous a Countrey
to the Crown of _England_, to whom of ancient Right, by the Discovery of
Sir _Sebastian Cabott_ in the time of _Henry_ the Seventh, it doth
belong, and for its Situation, Fertility, Neighborhood to our other
Plantations and several other Conveniences, of too valuable
consideration to be negligently lost: By the Care therefore and
Endeavors of those Great Men, it hath now two considerable Colonies
Planted in it, the one of _Albemarle_, on the North side, bordering on
_Virginia_, where are some hundreds of _English_ Families remov’d
thither from _New England_, and some of our other Plantations in the
_West-Indies_; and another towards the middle of the Countrey, at
_Charles-Town_, or _Ashley-River_, a Settlement so hopeful, for the
healthiness of the Land, and convenience of access by a large deep
Navigable River, and so promising in its very Infancy, that many of the
rich Inhabitants of _Barbados_ and _Bermudas_, who are now crowded up in
those flourishing Islands, and many in our other _American_ Plantations,
are turning their Eyes and Thoughts this way, and have already remov’d
part of their Stock and Servants thither. Nor is it to be doubted, but
that many, following the Example of those who went to _Albemarle_, will
be drawn to this better Plantation at _Ashley-River_, from
_New-England_, where the heat of their Zeal, and the coldness of the
Air, doth not agree with every Man’s Constitution; and therefore it is
to be thought, that many well temper’d Men, who are not much at ease
under such Extreams, will be forward to remove hither.

[Sidenote: Fair Terms propos’d to whomsoever shall remove thither.]

The Lords-Proprietors, for the comfortable subsistence, and future
enrichment of all those who shall this Year 1671. Transport themselves
and Servants thither, allow every Man a hundred Acres _per_ Head, for
himself, his Wife, Children and Servants, he carries thither, to him and
his Heirs for ever, paying onely one Peny an Acre, as a Chief-Rent;
which Peny an Acre is not to be paid these nineteen years; and those
Servants who go along thither with their Masters, shall each also have a
hundred Acres upon the same Terms, when he is out of his Time. But
though these Conditions are very advantageous, and the Countrey promises
to the Planter Health, Plenty and Riches at a cheap Rate, yet there is
one thing that makes this Plantation more valuable than all these, and
that is the secure possession of all these things with as great
certainty as the state of humane Affairs, and the transient things of
this Life are capable of, in a well continu’d Form of Government,
wherein it is made every Man’s Interest to preserve the Rights of his
Neighbor with his own; and those who have the greatest Power, have it
limited to the Service of the Countrey, the Good and Welfare whereof
whilest they preserve and promote, they cannot miss of their own, the
Lords Proprietors having no other aim, than to be the greatest Men in a
Countrey where every one may be happy if it be not his own fault, it
being almost as uncomfortable, and much more unsafe, to be Lord over,
than Companion of a miserable, unhappy, and discontented Society of Men.

With this Design the Lords-Proprietors, who are at great Charge for
carrying on this Plantation, have put the framing of a Government into
the Hands of one, whose Parts and Experience in Affairs of State are
universally agreed on, and who is by all Men allow’d to know what is
convenient for the right ordering Men in Society, and setling a
Government upon such Foundations, as may be equal, safe, and lasting;
and to this hath a Soul large enough to wish well to Mankind, and to
desire, that all the People where he hath to do might be happy. My Lord
_Ashley_ therefore, by the consent of his Brethren, the rest of the
Lords Proprietors, hath drawn up, to their general satisfaction, some
fundamental Constitutions, which are since, by their joynt approbation,
confirm’d to be the Model and Form of Government in the Province of
_Carolina_; the main Design and Ballance thereof (according to the best
of my memory, having had a Copy thereof) in short is as followeth:


[Sidenote: The Model drawn up by the Lord _Ashley_ for the Government of
           _Carolina_.]

1. Every County is to consist of forty square Plots, each containing
twelve thousand Acres. Of these square Plots each of the Proprietors is
to have one, which is to be call’d a _Signiory_. Eight of these square
Plots are to be divided amongst the three Noble-men of that County,
_viz._ a _Landgrave_, who is to have four of them; and two _Casiques_,
who are to have each of them two apiece; and these square Plots
belonging to the Nobility, are to be call’d _Baronies_. The other twenty
four square Plots, call’d _Colonies_, are to be the Possession of the
People: And this Method is to be observ’d in the Planting and Setting
out of the whole Countrey; so that one Fifth of the Land is to be in the
Proprietors, one Fifth in the Nobility, and three Fifths in the People.

2. The _Signories_ and _Baronies_, that is, the hereditary Lands
belonging to the Proprietors and Nobility, are all entirely to descend
to their Heirs, with the Dignity, without power of alienation, more than
for three Lives, or one and twenty years, or two Thirds of their
_Signiories_ and _Baronies_, and the rest to be _Demesne_.

3. There will be also some Mannors in the Colonies, but none less than
three thousand Acres in a Piece, which, like the rest of the Colony
Lands, will be alienable, onely with this difference, that it cannot be
parcell’d out, but if sold, it must be altogether.

4. There is to be a Biennial Parliament, consisting of the eight
Proprietors, the _Landgraves_ and _Casiques_, and one out of every
Precinct, that is the six neighboring Colonies, for the People, chosen
by the Freeholders; these are to sit and Vote altogether for the making
of Laws, which shall be in force no longer than sixty years after their
Enacting, the great mischief of most Governments, by which not onely the
People are mightily entangled by multiplicity of Rules and Penalties,
and thereby laid open to the Malice and Designs of troublesom Men and
cunning Projectors; but, which is far worse, the whole frame of the
Government in tract of time comes to be remov’d from its original
Foundation, and thereby becomes more weak and tottering.

5. There are eight supream Courts for the dispatch of all publick
Affairs; the first consists of the _Palatine_, who is the eldest of the
Proprietors, and hath power to call Parliaments, and dispose of publick
Offices. The other seven supream Courts are, 1. The chief Justices for
the determining of Controversies of _Meum_ and _Tuum_, and judging of
Criminals. 2. The Chancellors, for passing of Charters, and managing the
State Matters of the Province. 3. The High-Constables, for Military
Affairs. 4. The Admirals, for Maritime Affairs. 5. The High-Stewards,
for Trade. 6. The Treasurers, for the publick Stock; and 7. The
Chamberlains, for Ceremonies, Fashions, Marriages, Burials, _&c._ These
are the seven supream Courts, to whom lies the ultimate Appeal in all
Causes belonging to them. Each of these Courts consists of one
Proprietor, and six other Councellors, whereof two are chosen by the
Nobility, and two by the People. All the number of these eight Courts
joyn’d together make the Grand Council, which are in the nature of a
Council of State, and are entrusted with the management of Affairs of
greatest concernment. There is also in every County a Court, and in
every Precinct another; from the Precinct Court there lies an Appeal to
the County Court, and from the County Court to the Proprietors Court, to
which the Matter in question belongs, and there is the last decision and
determination thereof, without any farther Appeal. And to keep the
People from the Charges and vexation of long Suits, to the enriching of
Men cunning in Words, care is taken, that no Cause shall be Try’d more
than once in any one Court, and that profess’d Pleaders for Money shall
not be allow’d.

_Liberty of Conscience_ is here also allow’d in the greatest latitude,
but yet so, that neither Atheists, or Men of no Religion, are permitted;
Atheism, Irreligion, and vicious Lives being condemn’d, as disagreeable
to humane Nature, inconsistent with Government and Societies, and
destructive to all that is useful to, or becoming of Mankind; as on the
other hand, rigorous Imposing of, and hot Contentions about the
Ceremonies and Circumstances of Religion, is an occasion of perpetual
Strife, Faction and Division, keeps Men from sedate and temperate
Enquiries after Truth, eats out the great Cement of humane Conversation,
_Charity_, and cannot be found in any one, who hath but modesty enough
to think himself less than a _Pope_, and short of _Infallibility_.

There is also to be a Register of all Grants and Conveyances of Land, to
prevent even the occasions of Controversies and Law-Suits.

There are several other less considerable Particulars in this
Government, all contriv’d and design’d for the good and welfare of the
People; all which are so well put together, and in such equal proportion
ballance each other, that some judicious Men who have seen it, say, it
is the best and fairest Frame, for the well-being of those who shall
live under it, of any they have seen or read of.

                                Florida.


[Sidenote: Situation and Bounds.]

South-West of _Virginia_ lieth the spacious Countrey of _Florida_,
remarkable hitherto rather by the great pains which the _Spaniards_ have
taken, and the ill Successes they have met with in the discovery and
search of this Province, than by any thing else they have discover’d in
it answerable to their desires. On the East it hath the _Atlantick
Ocean_, or _Mare del Nordt_; on the South, and South-West, the Gulph of
_Mexico_ and _Mare Virginium_; and full West, part of _New Gallicia_,
and some other Countreys, not yet perfectly known.

[Sidenote: _Ponce_’s Expedition.]

[Sidenote: Water to make old People look young.]

This Countrey is also one of those, said to have been first of all
discover’d by Sir _Sebastian Cabot_, at the Charges of the King of
_England_, about the Year 1497. but afterwards more throughly search’d
into by _John Ponce de Leon_, a _Spaniard_, who in the Year 1512. set
Sail with three Ships out of the Haven _St. German_ in _Porto Rico_,
North-West to the Isles _Del Veio_, _Caycos_, _Yaguna_, _Amaguyao_,
_Manegua_, and _Guanahani_, first discover’d by _Christopher Colonus_,
and call’d _St. Salvador_: After that Steer’d North-West by a Coast,
which (because of its pleasant prospect) was call’d _Florida_ or
(according to the more common Opinion) because it was on _Palm-Sunday_,
which the _Spaniards_ call _Pascha de Flores_, (or _Pascha Florida_)
that he Landed here: And to find out a Haven he kept sight of the Shore,
which appear’d South-West from him. Here the Ships met with so strong a
Tide, that notwithstanding they had a fresh Gale of Wind, yet could they
not stem it; one of the Ships was driven to Sea out of sight; the other
two casting Anchor, which raking, drove toward the Shore; whither, being
beckned by the _Indians_, they immediately went; when no sooner he
Landed, but they ran in great Companies to make themselves Masters of
the Vessels, kill’d one _Spaniard_, and wounded two more: the Night
approaching put an end to the Fight. From hence Sailing to the River _La
Cruix_ for Wood and Water, they were resisted by sixty Natives, which
they put to flight with their Guns, and took one Prisoner; after which
they erected a Stone Cross. The Promontory, by which glides the strong
Current, lies in twenty Degrees North-Latitude, and call’d _Cabo de
Corrientes_, as the Row of Isles, before the Main Land _Los Martyres_,
because the Cliffs at a distance appear like Men standing on Poles.
Lastly, after some small Encounters with the _Floridans_, _Ponce_
return’d home, being onely inform’d falsly by the _Indians_, that in
_Florida_ was a River, and on the Isle _Bimini_ a Fountain, whose Waters
made old People young.

[Sidenote: _Vasquez_’s Expedition to _Florida_.]

[Sidenote: Habit of a _Floridan_ King.]

But after this _Florida_ remained not unvisited; for eight years after
the foremention’d Voyage, _Lucas Vasquez de Aylom_ weighed Anchor with
two Ships from _Hispaniola_, to fetch Slaves from the adjacent Isles for
the Gold-Mines, which Labor the Natives were not able to perform:
therefore steering his Course Northwardly, he Sail’d along the Coast of
_Chicoa_ and _Gualdape_, by them call’d _Cabo de St. Helena_, and _Rio
Jordan_, where the Natives look’d upon the Ships as Sea-Monsters, and
seeing Bearded Men in them, fled: the _Spaniards_ pursuing them,
overtook one Man and a Woman; who being well Entertain’d, and Clad in
_Spanish_ Habits, made the Strangers so acceptable to their
Countrey-men, that their King sent fifty Men Aboard of them with
Provisions, and to invite the Sea-men to his Dominions. The King sat
with a great Cloth about him, made fast on his Shoulders, covering his
Belly, Breast and Back with the Lappet thereof, and being long, was held
up by one of his Servants; over one of his Shoulders hung a String of
Pearl that came three times about, and reach’d down to his Thighs; on
his Head he wore a Cap full of Ribbonds; his Arms and Legs were also
surrounded with a double Chain of Pearl; in his right Hand he held a
very rich Staff: But the Queen went almost naked, onely a piece of a
wild Beasts Skin hung down before her from her left Shoulder to her
mid-Leg, and a double String of Pearl about her Neck hung down between
her Breasts, and her Hair Comb’d behind reach’d down to the Calves of
her Legs; about her Wrists and Ancles hung also Strings of Pearl.

[Illustration]

[Sidenote: Treachery of _Vasquez_.]

[Sidenote: _Indians_ misused.]

On the King’s Command, the _Spaniards_ were permitted to make inspection
into the Countrey, in which they were every where courteously
Entertain’d, and not without Gold and Silver Presents. Returning Aboard,
_Vasquez_ invited the _Indians_ to go with him, under pretence of
returning them thanks for the Favours which they had bestowed upon him;
but no sooner had he gotten a considerable number in his Ships, but he
set Sail, and losing one Ship, arriv’d with the other safe at
_Hispaniola_ with a few _Indians_, for most of them with grief and
hunger died at Sea, and those that remain’d alive, liv’d on dead
Carrion.

[Sidenote: _Vasquez_ defeated by the _Floridans_.]

Some few years after, _Vasquez_ receiving Letters Patent from the Court
of _Spain_ for the Government of _Florida_, fitted out a Ship thither in
1620. which brought a good Return of Gold, Silver, and Pearls; whereupon
he himself went not long after, and coming into the River _Jordan_, lost
one of his Ships, which proved not the worst Accident; for Landing two
hundred Men, they were all of them either slain or wounded by the
Inhabitants; so that _Vasquez_ was forc’d to sound a Retreat: And after
that the _Spaniards_ were less willingly drawn to that Coast, and the
rather, because the Inhabitants seem’d poor, and had little Gold but
what they procur’d from the _Otapales_ and _Olugatono_’s, sixty Leagues
Northward up in the Countrey.

[Sidenote: _Narvaez_ his Expedition.]

[Sidenote: Strange Booty.]

[Sidenote: He is in great extremity.]

[Sidenote: _Cabeca_ is Stranded.]

[Sidenote: His strange Entertainment at _Malhado_.]

Notwithstanding these unsuccessful Expeditions, _Pamphilus Narvaez_
retain’d so much Courage, that obtaining Letters Patents from the
Emperor _Charles_ the Fifth, he fitted out four Sail and a Brigantine,
weigh’d Anchor from _Cuba_ with six hundred Men and eighty Horse, in the
Year 1528. On _Florida_ he Landed three hundred Foot and forty two
Horse; they found many empty Huts, but in a great House a golden Bell
hid amongst the Nets, Chests full of Merchandise, and in each a dead
Body cover’d with Beast Skins, and painted; Pieces of Linnen Cloth, and
Wedges of Gold, which they had from the remote Countrey _Apalache_.
_Narvaez_, though against the Opinion of _Nunnez Cabeca_, march’d up
into the Countrey, whilst the Fleet was to stand along the Shore, and
travelling fifteen days saw neither House nor Man, onely here and there
some _Palmito_-Trees: Crossing a River on Floats, they were Encountred
by two hundred of the Natives; of which the _Spaniards_, having routed
them, took six Prisoners, who furnish’d them plentifully with _Indian_
Wheat. After this they march’d fifteen days farther, without discerning
the least foot-step of a Man; but at last they met an _Indian_ Lord with
a considerable Train, before whom march’d several Pipers: being told by
_Narvaez_ that his Journey was for _Apalache_, he conducted the
_Spaniards_ with a _Canoo_ over a River, and Landing again, walk’d with
them to his Village, where he Entertain’d them with great civility.
_Narvaez_, after a long and troublesom Journey, came at last in sight of
_Apalache_, a Village which contained two hundred and forty Straw
Houses, built between the Mountains on a Moorish Soyl, full of Nut,
Pine, and Savine-Trees, Oaks, Laurel, and short _Palmito_’s, besides the
Trees, which blown down in several places by a strong Wind from between
the Hills, and lying cross, cumber the High-ways: There are many deep
Pools, and also Bears, Lyons, and other ravenous Creatures, which make
the Ways very dangerous. _Narvaez_ falling suddenly on the Village, took
the _Casique_ Prisoner, as also store of Wheat, Mortars to pound it,
Hides, and Thred-spun Cloaks. Here he rested twenty five days, during
which time some of his Men Journey’d farther into the Countrey, yet
found none but poor People, troublesom Ways, and an unfruitful Soyl:
twice they were set upon by the Natives, who kill’d some of the Horses
and Men: They being a very strong People run stark naked, and as swift
as a Deer, Diving under Water from the _Spaniards_ Bullets; which not a
little amazing _Narvaez_, he thought it convenient to set upon the
Village _Aute_, lying on the Shore: Nine days he was in a miserable
condition before he got any Wheat, Pease, or other Provisions from this
Village; the getting whereof cost him very dear, for the Villagers
behav’d themselves so valiantly, that they kill’d many _Spaniards_, and
some of their Horses, which since they left the Haven of _St. Cruce_ had
travell’d two hundred and eighty Leagues; so that being tir’d and out of
heart, they could not carry the Sick and Wounded, who not able to go,
fell down dead in the Way: whereupon it was judg’d convenient to make
five Barques, in which they made their Shirts serve for Sails, the
Horses Tails and Mayns for Ropes, their Skins to hold fresh Water; with
which putting out to Sea, they saw no Land in seven days; and running
through the Straights of _St. Miguell_, Steer’d along the Coast of _Rio
del Palmes_; where they suffer’d great Drought, insomuch that some
drinking salt Water, died thereof: at last Landing, they were in the
Night set upon by a _Casique_, who having given _Narvaez_ a great Wound
in the Face, fled, leaving behind him a Sable Cloak, scented with Amber;
three days they rang’d again along the Sea-shore, when the Barque of
_Nunnez Cabeca_ being behind, was by Storm driven on the Shore, where a
hundred _Indians_ waited to cut them off, but were pacifi’d with some
Trifles: Thus being bereav’d of Arms, Provision, and all manner of
Necessaries, they found themselves on an Isle, by the Inhabitants call’d
_Malhado_, where they were lodg’d and maintain’d so long as they had any
thing left; but Famine grew at last to such a heighth, that they
devour’d one another, and in a short time of eighty Men there remain’d
onely four alive, _viz._ _Nunnez Cabeca_, _Castillo_, _Orantes_, and
_Estevanico_, who at last by Land reach’d to _New Gallicia_, and soon
after to _Mexico_, having escap’d a thousand Dangers. Of _Pamphilus
Narvaez_ never any tydings being heard, it is suppos’d he was drown’d.

[Sidenote: Strange Fight.]

After this miserable Adventure, the Business of _Florida_ lay dead for
eleven years, till _Ferdinandus Sottus_, chosen Governor of _Cuba_,
obtain’d so much of the Emperor _Charles_ the Fifth, that he ventur’d
one Expedition more for _Florida_: Besides Seamen he carried five
hundred Foot, and three hundred and fifty Horse; with which Landing in
the Bay _Del Espirito Santo_, he march’d against the Casique
_Vitacucho_, whom he took Prisoner, with a thousand of the Natives, whom
he either put to the Sword, or caus’d them to be torn in pieces by Dogs;
and staying all the Winter in _Apalache_, fortifi’d that place, and
furnish’d himself with Provisions; he was inform’d, that thirteen days
Journey from thence lay the Kingdom of _Cofachiqui_, abounding with
Gold, Silver, and Pearls, which made every one of the _Spaniards_ very
desirous to go thither, notwithstanding the Way was very dangerous; for
the valiant _Floridans_ lying in Ambuscade in the Corn-Fields, wounded
and kill’d many of them by Shooting from thence. _Sottus_, so soon as
_March_ approached, set forward on his Way. In the poor Province of
_Achalaqui_ he found a few young People, and the old most of them blind.
From _Cofachiqui_ he was follow’d by four thousand Natives, who carried
the _Spaniards_ Luggage, and serv’d them as Guides through Woods and
Wildernesses. The seventh day they stopp’d at a great River, whither
_Sottus_ sent four Companies to seek out a Passage over, whereof three
return’d without any effect, but the fourth, Commanded by Captain
_Annasio_, and a Colonel of a thousand _Cofachiquians_, came to a
Village built along the River; in which they made a miserable Rout,
killing all they lighted on, and hanging the Sculls of the Dead by their
sides: this done, they march’d back. _Sottus_ at last espying a Village
on the other side of the River, beckned to the Natives to come over to
him; whereupon six came immediately; who understanding that he desir’d
their friendly Assistance and Trade, promis’d to acquaint their
Governess, being a young Maiden: who soon after came over to _Sottus_,
and presented him with a String of Pearl: he complain’d to her for
Provisions, which she promis’d in part to store him with. Crossing the
River he found a brave Countrey, where were Pearls as big as gray Pease,
Copper of a golden colour, but no Gold. Out of the Tombs of their
Princes the _Spanish_ Officers, with the leave of the fore-mention’d
Maid their Governess, got an incredible Treasure in Pearls. In the
Village _Tolomeco_ they did the like. But here their Provisions growing
scarce, the Army was divided into two Bodies, _Balthasar de Gallegos_
leading one, and _Sottus_ the other; yet the Design of them both was on
the Province of _Chalaque_; whither marching, they were surpris’d by
such a violent Storm, that few would have been left to relate their
Adventures, had not the Trees bore it off from them; for it not onely
Thundred and Lightned as if Heaven and Earth would have met, but also
Hail-stones fell down as big as Eggs, which beat down the Boughs of
Trees. In the pleasant Valley _Xualu_, belonging to the Kingdom of
_Cofachiqui_, they rested fifteen days, and then march’d through
Countreys of _Guaxale_, _Acostes_, and _Coza_, where above a thousand
_Indians_, adorn’d with Plumes of Feathers and rich Furr Cloaks, came to
meet and welcom them, and to desire them from the _Casique_ to stay
there all the Winter; but _Sottus_ resolving to go to the Haven
_Achusi_, refus’d the same. After this he view’d _Talisse_, fortifi’d
with woodden and earthen Bulwarks; where the Casique _Tascalusa_, a Man
as big again as an ordinary _Spaniard_, receiv’d _Sottus_ with great
civility, and conducted him to _Mavilla_, lying in a pleasant place. The
City, surrounded with double Pallisado’s, fill’d up with Earth between,
(where also at eighty Paces distant from one another, stands a Tower to
contain eighty Soldiers) hath two Gates, eighty Houses, in every one of
which dwell a thousand Men, and a large Market-place in the middle;
where whilst the _Spaniards_ were in the midst of their Mirth, they on a
sudden heard a great cry of Arms; the first Assault was made by seven
thousand, which still increased by fresh Supplies; but the _Spaniards_
at last setting the City on fire, broke through them, and left above
eleven thousand slain, either by the Smoak and Flame, or by their
Bullets, Swords, Horses Heels and Dogs; the _Spaniards_ also lost eighty
three Men and forty three Horses. Thence going to _Chicora_ they were
stopt by the Natives before a deep River with high Banks, which at last
crossing, not without great trouble and blood-shedding, they Winter’d in
the Village _Chicora_, where the Inhabitants let them rest very quietly
for two Moneths; at the end of which, joyning together in the Night,
they shot fire into the Straw Roofs, and maintain’d a Fight of two hours
long, in which the _Spaniards_ lost forty Men, fifty Horses, and all
their Hogs, which were burnt in the Houses. From thence going to
_Chicacolla_ they were resisted in most places, and in the Fort
_Alibamo_ Engag’d by four thousand _Floridans_, who waited for their
coming; but those were so shrewdly handled, that half of them were
slain, and _Sottus_ became Master of the Fort, as also of _Chisca_,
which he Storm’d and took unawares. With no less trouble and danger did
he get over the River _El Grande_, where he discover’d a Village that
contain’d above four hundred Houses, and many delightful Fruit-Trees.
The Casique _Casquin_, maintain’d the _Spanish_ Army six days in this
place, and taking five thousand of his Subjects, march’d with them to
_Capaha_, which hath a deep and broad Moat on three sides thereof: the
fourth was fortifi’d with strong Pallisado’s, through which the
_Spaniards_ breaking, made way for _Casquin_, who put all to the Sword,
the Governor onely escaping in a _Canoo_ to a neighboring Isle. The
Entrance being thus taken by the _Spaniards_, _Casquin_ return’d home.
After which _Sottus_ concluded a Peace with _Capahaes_ the Governor, and
took up his Quarters in the Village _Vitangue_, where he receiv’d
continual Sallies; but taking fifteen _Casiques_ Prisoners, threatned to
burn them alive, unless they would procure them some Gold; yet not being
able to get any, they had only their Hands cut off and were sent away.
Moreover, _Sottus_ help’d the _Guachacoya_’s, to ruine those of
_Anilco_; which Design prov’d successful, yet not according to
_Sottus_’s desire, for he found not the Gold-Mines which he expected,
but spent in this five years Progress the great Treasure which he took
out of _Atibaliba_’s Palace; and the Pearls which he got in _Florida_,
for the Oysters being open’d against the Fire, and the Pearls drill’d
through with a hot Iron, lost much of their lustre, neither would his
People consent to build a City in the Haven _Achusi_. In the midst of
these Transitions _Sottus_ died of the Bloody-flux, and his Body was
Interr’d in the River _El Grande_. After which his Successor _Ludovicus
de Alvarado_ had worse success, for half of the Army being wasted by the
excessive heat, the rest resolv’d to desert _Florida_, utterly
despairing to be ever able to resist the valiant Natives. In the
Province of _Auche_ they procur’d a Guide, whom, because he mis-led them
in their Way, they caus’d to be torn in pieces by their Dogs: after
which they march’d without a Guide through such bad Ways, that they lost
a hundred of their Men and eighty Horses, besides many _Floridans_ that
carried their Luggage: At last coming to the River _El Grande_ they
conquer’d two Villages; which fortifying, they took up their Winter
Quarters in them. But this being the fourteenth year, in which the River
us’d generally to overflow and drown all the adjacent Countreys, on a
sudden, to their great amazement, the Wood which they had gather’d for
the building of Barques to carry them home, was wash’d away, their
Provisions spoil’d, and their Habitations drown’d: and to this
Inconvenience was added another yet greater; for the Governors round
about rais’d all the Forces they could possibly, to revenge themselves
on the _Spaniards_ for their great oppression. But _Alvarado_ being
inform’d of this Design by the Casique _Anilco_, caus’d thirty of the
Abettors of the Plot to have their Hands cut off. Not long after this
the _Spaniards_ set Sail, when a thousand _Canoos_ that came to Engage
them lay sixteen days amongst them, killing and wounding several of the
Seamen, and sunk a Barque with forty eight Men, and also kill’d many
Horses which were yet on the Shore; the Prisoners they took were
strappado’d to death, and the Horses shot: yet some of them got safe
from _Panuco_ to _Mexico_.

[Sidenote: Expedition of _Ahumada_ and _Samano_.]

These above-mention’d Expeditions to _Florida_, notwithstanding they
fell out unfortunately, nevertheless by the permission of _Philip_ the
Second, King of _Spain_, _Peter Ahumada_ and _Julius Samano_, with five
_Dominican_ Monks, made another Attempt, and Landed with several great
Crosses, that thereby they might reduce the _Floridans_, whose Language
they understood not, to their Faith: But they fearing treachery,
resisted them, and kill’d the Monks with Clubs, flay’d them, and hung
their Skins in their Temples.

[Sidenote: The Expedition of _Menendez_.]

Notwithstanding these and many worse Accidents that hapned, yet the
_Spanish_ King ventur’d once more, and sent _Peter Menendez_ to
_Florida_; whither he was follow’d by three _Jesuits_ from _Rome_,
_viz._ _Peter Martinius_, _Joan Roger_, and _Francis Villaregius_: The
Master of the Ship in which they went being ignorant where he was,
judg’d it convenient to Land; whereupon nine _Netherlanders_ and four
_Spaniards_, amongst which was _Martinius_, went ashore on _Florida_,
whilst a Storm arising drove the Ship to _Cuba_; by which means those
that were Landed were left in a miserable condition, having no Food but
wild Herbs, on which they fed twelve days: so that this Expedition also
came to nothing.

[Sidenote: Voyage of _Ribald_ and _Laudoniere_.]

At last the _French_ following the foot-steps of the _Spaniards_, _John
Ribald_ and _Rene Laudoniere_ having Sail’d several times to _Florida_,
discover’d several Coasts; but their Men were often set upon by the
_Spaniards_, and cut off.

[Sidenote: The Expedition of _Dominicus Gurgius_.]

[Sidenote: Valiant Exploit of _Gurgius_.]

_Anno 1567._ _Dominicus Gurgius_ set Sail thither with three Ships,
which carried two hundred Soldiers and eighty Sea-men; with which
entring the River _Tacatucouru_ he Landed, and found a Youth call’d
_Peter du Bre_, who escap’d when the _Spaniards_ cruelly massacred the
_French_ in the Garrison _Carolina_; after which _du Bre_ ranging up and
down, at last serv’d _Saturiona_, Governor of _Florida_; whom deserting,
and now meeting with the _French_ his Countrey-men, he brought several
_Casiques_ to joyn with them against the _Spaniards_, whom they drove
out of three Forts, which were all by the Command of _Gurgius_
dismanteled.

[Sidenote: City _Augustine_.]

_Florida_ is call’d by the Natives, _Irquasa_. The _Spaniards_ have
built two Forts on the same, the one erected on the Promontory _Helena_,
is Consecrated to the Apostle _Matthew_. The City and the Fort
_Augustine_ lies near the River _May_. Both City and Fort stand on a
Hill, which is pleasant and well set with Trees. Between the _Foreland_
is a deep and wide Channel, which washes the City and Fort; it is
eight-square, at each corner there stands a round Tower, in which the
Soldiers keep Guard; the Countrey is water’d by two Rivers, which
gliding between the _Main_ and the _Foreland_, are great Safeguards to
the Fort. The City is almost square, onely against the Fort it is much
closer built than in any other place, and divided into four Streets. The
Church stands without of the City, and before it the _Augustine_
Cloyster.

[Sidenote: Their Food in time of War.]

[Sidenote: Their Priests are Sorcerers.]

[Sidenote: Strange actions.]

[Sidenote: Cruelty on the conquer’d.]

[Sidenote: Remarkable Mourning for the Dead.]

The Inhabitants of _Florida_ are an Olive colour, tall, and without any
deformity; their Skins generally painted, and their Bodies naked, onely
a Deer’s Skin about their middle, their Hair long and black, hanging
down to their Hams, but most of them tie it in a Knot on the top of
their Heads; two small Boards cover their Breasts, and six lesser hang
on their Arms, two Bells at each Ear, and a Cap on their Head, with a
Feather: Their Quivers, which are always full of Arrows, sharpned with
Fish Bones, hang by their Sides; In their left-Hand they hold a great
Bowe, with which they go to War, the King walking before with a Club.
They Consult daily about warlike Affairs in the King’s Palace, where he
himself sits on a high Seat; the Grandees salute him first with their
Hands lifted over their Head, crying _Ha, He, Ya_, at which the rest cry
_Ha, Ha_; then every one sits down on a Stool round about the Room. If
they have any Business of Consequence to debate, then the King sends for
the ancientest Persons and Priests, call’d _Jawas_; this done, they give
a Cup of _Cassine_ (which is a hot Drink made of Herbs) to the King;
after which every one drinks in order out of the same Cup. This Liquor
occasions Sweat, quenches Thirst, and satisfies the Appetite for twenty
four hours. When they March against their Enemies they live on _Indian_
Wheat, Honey, smoak’d Fish, and divers sorts of wild Roots, amongst
which they mix Sand and Cinders, to preserve them the longer. No sooner
are the two Armies come within sight one of another, but the Kings of
both Parties roll their Eyes about in their Heads, mutter something to
themselves, and make strange Gestures and Exclamations; which is
answer’d by a general Cry of the whole Army: then each King turning
himself with great Reverence to the Sun, takes a woodden Platter with
Water, which he throws over his Army so far as he is able, and begs of
the Sun to grant him, that he may spill his Enemies Blood in like
manner; then throws another Dish-full into the Fire, wishing that his
Soldiers may thus Offer the Bodies of their Foes to the Flames; then
step forth the Priests, who are always skill’d in the Art of Necromancy,
and seating themselves on a Shield in the midst of the Army, draw a
Circle, in which they make many strange Gestures, not without muttering
to themselves, and seemingly say a Prayer of a quarter of an hour long;
during which they deport themselves so strangely, that they rather seem
to be Devils themselves, than Charmers of the Devil: They turn their
Eyes quite round, and their Bodies as if without Joynts; at length being
wearied they leap out of the Circle, and inform the King of the number
and condition of the Enemies Army. Those whom they take Prisoners they
flay alive, and drying their Skins at the Fire, tie them to long Poles,
and carry them home as Trophies of their Victory, and afterwards set
them up in some Field or spacious place, putting both Men and Women to
watch them; then comes the Priest with a woodden Image, and utters
Execrations against the slain Enemies; at a corner of the Fields kneel
three Men, one of which striking with great force on a Stone, gives as
many Blows as the Priest pronounces Curses, whilst the other two shake
their _Calabashes_ fill’d with Stones, and Sing many strange Songs: No
sooner is this ended, but the Women whose Husbands are slain in the
Battel, walking to the King, cover their Faces with their Hands, make
many strange Gestures, and desire liberty to take what revenge they can,
and licence also to Marry at the limited time; all which the King
permitting, they return thus comforted home crying. Not long after they
go to the place where their Husbands lie buried, where they crop their
Hair up to their Ears, and throw it on the Grave, as also the Arms and
Drinking-Cups which the Deceased us’d in their life-time; after which
they may not Marry before their Hair be grown again to their Shoulders.
The same Custom is also observ’d when their King is buried but then also
all his Subjects Fast and Howl three days together, stick his Grave full
of Arrows, and burn his House and all his Goods.

[Sidenote: _Floridans_ differ amongst themselves.]

The _Floridans_ differ amongst themselves very much, for those that
inhabit the Province _Panuca_, which borders upon _New Spain_, are
valiant and cruel People, Offering their Prisoners to their Idols, and
eating them. The Men pluck up the Hair of their Beards by the Root, make
holes through their Nose and Ears, and Marry not till their fortieth
Year.

Next to these follow the Realms of _Aranaris_ and _Albardaosia_,
inhabited by a People, which exceed all others in subtilty.

The Natives of _Jaquazia_ run faster than a Deer, and tire not though
they travel a whole day.

[Sidenote: Hermophrodites.]

The best Swimmers are found in _Alpachia_, _Authia_, and _Someria_,
where the Women Swim through deep and great Rivers with their Children
in their Arms. Here also are many Hermophrodites, which carry all the
Luggage when an Army is upon a March.

[Sidenote: Their manner of taking Crocodiles.]

[Sidenote: As also their Deer.]

We find mention’d also two other Provinces of note, _viz._ _Colas_
(which lies near the Point call’d _Cape Florida_) and _Tegista_, or
_Florida_ properly so call’d, being that long _Peninsula_, which
pointing upon the Isle _Cuba_, by the Cape _Los Martyres_, stretcheth it
self North and South about a hundred Leagues in length, but not above
thirty in breadth where it is largest. In this Province is the _Rio de
lo Spirito Santo_. The Soyl, though it produces _Indian_ Wheat twice a
year, yet it is never Dung’d, but when the Corn (which is planted in
_March_ and _June_) is in, they burn the Weeds; the Ashes of which
serves them in stead of Soil. The King divides the Corn according to
every Mans Family. In the Winter they dwell four Moneths in the Woods,
where they build small Huts of Palm-boughs, feed on Venison, smoak’d
Fish, and Crocodiles, which have pure white Flesh, and are caught after
this manner: On the Shore of the Rivers they build little Houses full of
round Holes, in which they place a Watch, who is to give notice to ten
or twelve Associates, cover’d all over with Boughs full of little sharp
Prickles, which they thrust into the Crocodiles Throat, who with open
Mouth comes running at them, and so throwing him on his Back, stick his
Belly full of Arrows, and kill him with Clubs. But with more subtilty
and art they take their Deer, _viz._ They hide themselves under a Stags
Skin, so cunningly, that it seems as if living, which they place near
the Rivers where the Deer generally come to drink, when on a sudden they
shoot them.

[Sidenote: _Floridans_, though libidinous, yet live long.]

Their Priests serve in stead of Chirurgeons, wherefore they always carry
a Bag full of Herbs about with them, which are chiefly good against
venereal Distempers; for these People are exceeding libidinous; nay,
Sodomy and defiling of young Children is accounted no sin: Yet though
they are much inclin’d to Women, they attain to a great Age.

_Rene Laudoniere_ Landing not far from the City _Augustine_, situate on
the Banks of the River _May_, met with the _Floridan_ Governor
_Saturiona_, who conducted him to the _French_ King’s Court of Arms,
erected two years before, which _Saturiona_, as a testimony of his zeal
to the _French_, had Crown’d with Laurel and Flowers. _Saturiona_ had
with him also his Son _Atoreus_, who had begotten divers Children on his
Mother; whom his Father after that time no more acknowledging, resign’d
her up wholly to him: At which time also his great Grandfather being
then living, was above a hundred and fifty years old, and saw his
Childrens Children to the fifth Generation.

[Sidenote: Their horrid Religion.]

The Religion in _Florida_ is abominable, wicked, and cruel: When they
return Conquerors from a Battel, the old Women rake off the dry’d Hair
from the fore-mention’d Poles, hold it aloft, and thank the Sun for
their Victory. But the Offerings of their first-born Sons are terrible,
for they knock out their Brains with a Club in the presence of the King.
Their annual worshipping of the Sun is also very ridiculous; for filling
the Skin of a Stag full of sweet-smelling Herbs, they hang the Horns and
Neck with Garlands, and carry it with the noise of their kind of Vocal
and Instrumental Musick, to a high Trunk or hollow Body of a Tree, on
which they place the stuff’d Stag, with his Head towards the Sun; which
done, they falling down, desire that he would please to afford them
plenty of all such Fruit as they Offer to him; after which taking their
leave, they let the fore-mention’d Skin remain there till the following
Year.

The _Spaniards_ since their Defeat in the Fort _Carolina_, and their
Engagement with Sir _Francis Drake_, _Anno 1585._ have had little
disturbance on _Florida_.

[Sidenote: _Drake_’s Exploit on _Florida_.]

_Drake_ having burnt and plunder’d _Domingo_ and _Carthagena_, steer’d
along the Coast of _Florida_, and discover’d a Beacon on the same;
whereupon he sent out Spies, who sail’d a League up a River, on whose
Banks they saw a Fort, and somewhat higher the Town _Augustine_, built
full of woodden Houses; all which being related to him, he steer’d
thither, fir’d his Guns twice against the Fort _St. John_; which the
_Spaniards_ answering onely with one Volley, fled, with their Commander
_Peter Menendez_; when the _English_ prepar’d to Storm, a Prisoner,
being a _French_-man, came in a Boat from them to _Drake_, and inform’d
him that the _Spaniards_ had left the City _Augustine_ and Fort _St.
John_; to which _Drake_ going, found there Pallisado’s of pleited
Boughs, cover’d with Earth, and a Chest with two thousand Pound, for the
payment of the Soldiers, and fourteen Brass Guns, with which he set Sail
from thence.

The Mountains of this Countrey are onely the _Apalatei_, suppos’d by the
Natives to have rich Mines of Gold in them, and which the _Spaniards_
saw, but had not time, nor other accommodation to stay and search them,
by reason they were so much wearied and wasted with a long March before
they gat thither, and found the People so stout and obstinate
thereabouts, that in stead of entertaining them with their Hens and
Fowl, as other places had done, they were welcom’d with Blows, and made
to return, leaving not a few of their best Soldiers behind.

Rivers there are many, and those very large and commodious, as 1. _Rio
Secco_, or _The Dry River_, so call’d by the _Spaniards_ (as some think)
because they could find no Gold in it. 2. _Rio Grande_, or _The Great
River_. 3. _Ligeris._ 4. _Garunna._ 5. _Sequana_, _&c._ These last, so
nam’d by the _French_, who, after the _Spaniards_, for some time had,
but never held any long possession of the Countrey. There are also _Rio
de Flores_, _Rio de Nieves_, and _Rio de Spirito Santo_, lesser Streams,
yet all of them, with the rest, falling at several places into the great
Lake of _Mexico_; and some of them not a little haunted by the _Caymans_
or _West-Indian_ Crocodiles, a Creature, as hath been said before,
dangerous both at Sea and Land.

The Natives, who as yet hold Possession and Command of it for the most
part, are themselves generally sorted into certain Tribes or great
Families; all which are Govern’d severally by Chiefs of their own, whom
they call _Paracoussi_, and by reason thereof are almost continually in
Feud and War one with another.

The Towns and Places most known in this Province, are 1. _St. Helens_,
seated on or near unto a Promontory of the same Name, where this
Countrey bordereth on _Virginia_. 2. _Fort Charles_, or _Arx Carolina_,
built and so nam’d by the _French_ King, but afterwards ruin’d by the
_Spaniards_. 3. _Port Royal_, a well frequented Haven, at the Mouth of a
River which beareth the same Name. More within Land there is, 1.
_Apalache_, an old Town of the Natives, formerly a Place of great
resort, but now a poor thing of about forty or fifty Cottages; and yet
as poor as it is, _Pamphilius Narvaez_, as before related, when he
search’d the Countrey, found the Natives not willing to part with it:
for though he took it from them, it was not without some resistance, and
they quickly recover’d it again: and at the 2. nam’d _Aute_, another old
Town of theirs, nine days March from the other, they overtook him, and
fell so resolutely upon him, that he left not a few of his best Soldiers
dead upon the place, and was content himself to march quietly away with
the rest. 3. _Ochalis_, a Town consisting of about five or six hundred
Sheds and Cottages likewise of the Natives. 4. _Vittacuche_, a Burrough
of two hundred Houses.

There is also on the Eastern Shore of this _Peninsula_, _St. Matthews_,
a Place possess’d and well fortifi’d by the _Spaniards_; and _St.
Augustines_ on the same Shore, but lying somewhat more Southerly than
the other, at the Mouth of a River of the same Name, taken and sack’d by
Sir _Francis Drake_ in the Year 1585.

                               SECT. II.
                                Jucatan.

_Jucatan_ is a _Peninsula_, or half-Island, being encompass’d with the
Sea on all sides, save onely to the South-West, where it is joyn’d to
_Guaxata_, its farther and more Easterly Point looking towards _Cuba_.
The knowledge of, when, and by whom this Province was discover’d, is
included in that of _New Spain_, of which some will have it to be a
part. The whole Province contains in compass nine hundred Miles or more,
and lies between eighteen and twenty two Degrees of Northern Latitude,
or thereabouts, the Air somewhat hot, and the Soil not altogether so
fertile as some other parts of _New Spain_ are; but in recompence
thereof the People are so much the more industrious, living for the most
part by Handicraft Trades. Neither is it altogether unstor’d with Corn
and divers sorts of Fruits, besides what it hath of Fowl and Beasts, as
Geese, Hens, Deer, _&c._ particularly it yieldeth plenty of Wax and
Honey, by reason of its frequent Swarms of Bees. They report some
special things of this Province, as namely, that the People of the
Countrey us’d generally, and long before the _Spaniards_ came thither, a
certain Ceremony of Religion, not much unlike to our Baptism, and which
they call’d by a Name that in their Language signifi’d _Regeneration_,
or _A Second-Birth_; that they observ’d it so diligently, that few or
none amongst them omitted to initiate themselves by it, believing, that
thereby the Seeds and Ground-work of all Goodness was laid in them, and
that they were fortifi’d by it against the assaults and temptations of
evil Spirits; that after they were three or four years old, till they
came to twelve, they usually thus Wash’d and Baptiz’d themselves; and
that none were permitted amongst them to Marry, that were not first
initiated after this manner; that they chose likewise a solemn Day upon
which to do this; and that the Friends and Relations (especially the
Father and Mother) of the Parties to be initiated, as well as the
Parties themselves, always Fasted three days before the said Initiation;
and that a great many of the Natives had a Tradition, or general Report
amongst them, that of ancient time this Province of _Jucatan_ was
possess’d and cultivated by a certain People which came thither from the
East, after a tedious long wanderring, and many hardships endur’d at
Sea, having escap’d the Hands of their Enemies onely through the power
of the Deity they worshipp’d; who help’d them, and made them to pass
securely, even through the Waves of the Sea. All which, if true, seems
not a little to confirm the Report which goeth for currant in the
_Welsh_ Chronicles, of one _Madoc ap Owen_, the Son of _Guineth_, a
Prince of that Countrey, who is said to have fall’n upon a far Countrey
this way in his Travels; which he lik’d so well, that having secur’d to
his Companions their safe abode there during his absence, he return’d
himself into _Wales_ for more Men; and that he transported thither as
many as he could carry in ten Barques full fraught. This he is said to
have done about the Year of our Lord 1170. but neither he nor any of his
Men were ever heard of since; and the success of the Expedition, it
seems, little enquir’d after by the _Welsh_. However, the Relation seems
not altogether incredible.

The chief Towns of the Province are, 1. _Merida_, in the Navel of the
Countrey, and the Seat of the Governor, twelve Leagues distant from the
Sea on either side. 2. _Valladolidt_, thirty Leagues distant from
_Merida_. 3. _Campeche_, a great Town, consisting of about three
thousand Houses or more, when first conquer’d by the _Spaniards_; who
found such Monuments of Art and Industry in it, as did clearly argue,
that the Place had been once possess’d by some People that were not
barbarous. It is now call’d _St. Francisco_, and was surpriz’d in the
Year 1596. by Captain _Parker_, an _English_-man, who took the Governor
himself and some other Persons of Quality with him, together with a Ship
richly laden with Gold and Silver, besides other Commodities of good
value. 4. _Tabasco_, by the _Spaniard_ now call’d _Villa de Nuestra
Sennora de Victoria_, and commonly _Victoria_ onely, in memory, as ’tis
thought, of the first great Victory which _Cortez_ obtain’d over these
People at the Battel of _Potonchan_, as hath been said. 5. _Cintla._ 6.
_Potonchan._ 7. _Salamanca._

All along the Coast of this Countrey there lie certain Islands, some
within the Bay or Gulph call’d _Honduras_, pertaining to the next
Province, as 1. _La Zarza._ 2. _La Desconescida._ 3. _Vermeia._ 4. _Los
Negrillos_; and some without it, as 1. _Zaratan._ 2. _Pantoia._ 3. _De
Mugeres_, or _The Island of Women_; so nam’d by the _Spaniards_, who at
their first Discovery of these Parts, for a long time together could
meet with none but Women. The chief of them is call’d _Acusamil_,
commonly _Cozamul_, and is fifteen Leagues in length, and about five in
breadth, and was as it were the Thorow-fare, or Common Road of the
_Spaniards_, when they first discover’d the Countreys of _New Spain_:
For first here Landed _Ferdinando de Corduba_; after him _John de
Grialva_, and others; and last of all the fortunate _Cortez_. It is now
call’d _St. Crux_.

                               CHAP. IV.
                               Guatimala.


[Sidenote: Its Situation and Bounds.]

_Guatimala_ stretcheth to the _Isthmus_, or Neck of Land, which, as we
said, joineth the Northern and Southern parts of the _New World_
together.

This Countrey is bounded Northward with the _Peninsula_ of _Jucatan_
abovesaid, and part of the Gulph or Bay of _Honduras_; on the South,
with _Mare del Zur_; on the East and South-East, it hath _Castella
Aurea_; and on the West, _New Spain_. The length of it lieth upon the
Coast of _Mare del Zur_, and is said to be little less than three
hundred Leagues; but the breadth not half so much, and in some places
very narrow. It is generally a fertile and good Countrey in all
respects, but especially abounding in Cattel and good Pastures; it is
subdivided into seven inferior Provinces or Countreys, which are 1.
_Chiapa._ 2. _Verapaz._ 3. _Honduras._ 4. _Nicaragua._ 5. _Veragua._ 6.
_Costa Rica_; and 7. _Guatimala_, specially so call’d: all differing in
Language and Customs one from another.

The Bishoprick (as it is now call’d) of _Chiapa_ is border’d on the West
with _New Spain_; on the East with _Vera Paz_; and on the South with
_Mare del Zur_. It is a Countrey much shaded with Woods, and those
replenish’d with many fair and goodly Trees, of divers sorts, and of the
largest size, as Oaks, Pines, Cedar, Myrtle, and Cypress-Trees, besides
others which yield them a good kind of Rozen, precious Gums, _&c._ also
several sorts of Balsom, as white, red, green, and black, not onely
pleasant to the Scent, but an excellent Remedy for all manner of green
Wounds: the best of it drops out of the cut Bodies of the Trees; and the
worst is press’d out of the Wood and Leaves.

[Sidenote: Trees and Plants.]

There are also proper to this Countrey several other kinds of Trees and
Plants, as that whose Fruit tastes like Pepper and Cloves, being of a
great heighth; a Tree whose Leaves cure all ulcerated Sores, or the
bitings of any poysonous Beast.

There is a sort of Cabbage call’d _Ilantas_, which grows to the heighth
of a Tree, so that Birds make their Nests in them; they are eaten
likewise like other common Cabbages.

There is also an Herb with narrow Leaves, which is no sooner touch’d,
but it shrinks up to nothing; but at the going away of those which touch
it, it obtains its former vigour.

[Sidenote: Birds.]

Here are likewise Quails, Ducks, Geese, Pheasants, Parrots,
Turtle-Doves, Pigeons, and the like, in great abundance.

Amongst the several sorts of Falcons which breed in this Countrey, there
is one sort which hath one Foot proper to its kind, the other like that
of a Goose; it feeds on Fish along the Rivers.

The Bird _Toto-Queztall_, which is somewhat smaller than a Pigeon, with
green Feathers and a long Tail, is taken onely for its Tail, which when
the _Indians_ have pull’d out, they let the Bird fly again, there being
a Law amongst them, that whosoever kills one of them, is to suffer
death.

The Cranes here are of a dark Gray; the biggest of them have a tuft of
Feathers like a Crown upon their Heads.

[Illustration]

[Sidenote: Birds.]

The Birds _Guacamayes_, which are red and blue, are like a _Peruan_
Goose.

[Sidenote: Beasts.]

Moreover, the Countrey yields brave Horses, Goats, Sheep, Rabbets, and
Foxes; also wild Dogs, Leopards, Lyons, and Tygers.

The wild Hogs which breed here have their Navels on their Backs, and
have no Tails, they smell exceeding strong, and feed together in great
Companies.

The _Taquatrin_, a certain Beast proper to those Parts, hath a Bag under
its Belly, in which it generally carries seven or more young ones, and
hath also a bald Tail; it creeps into Houses in the Night to steal Hens.

Here is also a certain Beast (whose Name we find not) about the bigness
of a Rabbet, and like a Rat, and carries its young ones on its back
whensoe’re it comes abroad.

The Serpents, which are very numerous here, trouble the Inhabitants
exceedingly, especially near the Village _Ecatepeque_, where there are
such an abundance on two little Hills, that none dares approach them;
some of them are very poysonous, for if touch’d with a Stick, the Poyson
runs up the same: and whoever are anointed with the Blood of a dead
Serpent, die a lingring Death. _John de Laet_ relates, that the
_Indians_ took one which carried thirty young ones, which being a Finger
long, crep up and down immediately; and the old one, being above twenty
Foot long, serv’d the Natives for Venison.

Amongst other Beasts is also the _Teuthlacokauhqui_, or _Fortress of the
Serpents_; it hath a Head like an Adder, thick Belly, glittering Scales,
a black Back, sprinkled with white Crosses; at its Tail there grows
yearly a Bone, with which it makes a noise when it stirs; its poysonous
Teeth destroy those which are bit therewith in twenty four Hours, unless
the part which is wounded be held in the Earth so long till the pain be
over. Notwithstanding the noise, terrible aspect, and gestures of this
Animal, the _Indian_ Hunters make nothing to take the same by the Tail,
and wrap it up in Linnen, and carrying it home make it tame. It is able
to live a whole Year without either Meat or Drink; its Head when cut off
grows to the bigness of a Man’s Thigh in ten days time.

No less resolute are the Indians in taking the _Ibitobaca_, which is an
Ell long, of a crimson Colour, full of black and white Specks, the Bones
whereof they wear about their Necks in stead of Chains.

[Sidenote: The Serpent _Iquanna_.]

The _Iquanna_ is a Serpent which doth no manner of hurt, though terrible
to look upon to those which know it not, having a Bag under its Chin, a
glittering Comb on its Head, and on its Back sharp Bones, which stand
like a Saw, and a long Tail: It lays fifty Eggs at a time as big as
Acorns, of a very good taste, and fit to eat when boyl’d: It also lives
both in the Water and on the Land.

[Sidenote: Baboons.]

Here are also many Baboons, which are big and heavy, with ugly Heads,
short Legs like a Man, and Tails standing upwards; they eat all sorts of
Fruit, but chiefly covet after Wine and Bread; and are so lascivious,
that they often set upon Women: The Females generally bring forth two,
one Male, and the other Female. There is also another sort, whose Skins,
being red, are full of little Spots.

The ancient Inhabitants of _Chiapa_ (divided into the _Chiapaneca_’s,
the _Zeques_, the _Zeltates_, and the _Quelenes_) are very Civil and
Witty, also skilful in Painting, Singing, Breaking of Horses, and many
other Trades.

[Sidenote: Towns and Villages of Note.]

The Places of more principal note in this Countrey, inhabited by the
_Spaniards_, are 1. _Ciudad Real_, pleasantly seated in the midst of a
round Vale or Plain, and almost encompass’d with Hills representing the
form of an Amphitheatre; also at the Foot of one which stands in the
midst of the rest, the City is built. It is a City specially Priviledg’d
by the King of _Spain_, having a Court of Justice, Cathedral, and
_Dominican_ Cloyster; of a pure and temperate Air, and the Countrey
round about plentifully abounding both in Corn and Fruit, onely somewhat
too cold to produce Lemmons and Oranges; but for Pears, Apples, Peaches,
Quinces, Cherries, and the like, they grow here in great abundance.

2. _Chiapa_, which giveth Name to the Valley aforesaid; It is a Bishop’s
See, and famous, if but for one of its Prelates, _viz._ _Bartholomeo de
las Casas_, of the Order of _Predicants_, who was Bishop of this City,
and his Memory justly precious amongst the poor _Americans_ at this day,
for his Charity towards them, and for the stout and zealous opposition
which he made against the _Spaniards_ cruel and inhumane dealings with
the Natives at the beginning of their Conquests: by which at last,
notwithstanding much difficulty and resistance made by interested
Persons of the other Side, he procur’d them liberty, and an Edict from
the Emperor in favor of them; whereby they were declar’d to be a Free
People, and not Slaves, and the _Spaniards_ forbidden to use them any
longer as such, or to force them to any kind of Labour against their
wills, or otherwise than by agreement with them, which Liberty they
enjoy to this day; and though the _Spaniards_ are said to give them very
small Wages in some places, and for their Work in their Sugar-Mills
(which is no small Labor) not above five _Reyals_, or Two shillings six
pence a Week, for the Maintenance of themselves, their Wives and
Children, yet by reason it is with Consent, and in a Countrey where all
things are plentiful and cheap, their Condition is much better than it
was, and the favor which that good Bishop did them, never to be
forgotten. It is at present a great and populous City, and lieth almost
in the mid-way betwixt the Cities of _Mexico_ and _Guatimala_.

3. _St. Bartholomews_, in the Countrey of the _Quelenes_.

4. _Tecpatlan_, the chief of twenty five Villages, said to belong to the
_Zoques_. Here the _Dominicans_ have another Cloyster.

The _Zeltates_ possess a fruitful Countrey, have thirteen Villages
planted with Trees that yield _Cochenile_, being under a Common-wealth
Government.

The chief Place of the _Quelenes_ is _Copanavatzla_, where there is good
Cheese, and store of brave Cattel: The River _Chiepa_ gliding through
the midst thereof, loseth it self in the Northern Ocean. In this part of
the Country are Beasts not unlike Apes, with long Tails, which they wind
about the Legs of those whom they find swimming and so pull them under
Water; wherefore they that go to Swim take Axes along with them, to cut
off their Tails.

The Water of the River _Blanco_ is clear and wholsom, running for the
most part through Rocky Grounds, which nevertheless are overspread with
Trees.

In the highest Ground of _Chiapa_, a League and a half from the City
_Reall_, spring clear Fountains, whose Water ebbs and flows every six
hours.

Near the Village call’d _Afixa_ is one which runs three years together,
though in the driest Season, and is dry three years, though it Rain
never so much.

Not far from the Village _Cinacatan_ is another Spring, whose Water
cures several Sicknesses, but kills all Birds and Beasts which drink of
the same.

Here are likewise divers Baths.

The Rivers which run out of the Valley _Chiapa_, fall into two great
Pits.

Near the Village _Bartholomew_, in the Province _Quelenes_, is a strange
Cavern, out of which by the throwing of a stone into the same, are heard
mighty noises like claps of Thunder.

Not far from the Village _Chicomucolo_, appears a Cavern, in which is a
great Plain on one side, and a standing Lake, whose Water is like Sand,
on the other.

The _Spaniards_, if they wanted not Slaves, might dig good store of
Gold, Silver, Copper, Lead, Tin, and Quicksilver, out of the Mynes on
the Mountain _Ecatepeck_, which is in nine Leagues compass: The Wind
blows so strong after Sun-rising, that no Man is able to travel for it,
but in the Night.


                               SECT. II.
                               Vera Paz.

[Sidenote: Situation and Bounds.]

_Vera Paz_, or _The Countrey of True Peace_, was so nam’d by the
_Spaniards_, as they say, because it was never conquer’d by the Sword,
but reduc’d to Obedience onely by the Preaching of the _Dominican_
Fryers. It is bounded on the West and South-West with _Chiapa_; on the
East with some part of _Guatimala_ and _Honduras_; and on the North with
_Jucatan_. It contains about thirty Leagues in length, and almost as
much in breadth, being a woody and mountainous Countrey for the most
part, yet well distinguish’d with Valleys and lower Ground. It is much
subject to Rain, which ’tis said to have for nine Moneths of the Year
almost continually; by reason whereof the Countrey, being otherwise hot,
is much annoy’d with a kind of _Mosquit_, or great sort of Gnats, which
spoil the Fruit very much, and are otherwise not a little trouble to the
People. Moreover, there happen oftentimes terrible Earthquakes and
Storms, with Thunder and Lightning.

[Sidenote: Commodities of the Countrey.]

The chief Commodities of this Countrey, are a kind of Amber, which some
call _Liquid Amber_, which drops from divers of their Trees, and is said
to be a Commodity very precious, and of much use; _Mastick_, _Sanguis
Draconis_, _Gum Anime_, _Sarsaparilla_, _China-Wood_, and divers other
Medicinal Drugs, which it affordeth in great plenty. The Woods afford a
sweet smell, and the Trees in the same grow a wonderful heighth.

The Canes which grow here, being a hundred Foot long, and proportionably
thick, serve for Timber.

There is also a hard Wood call’d _Iron-Wood_, either from its hardness
or colour, or both, which never rots.

The abundance of Flowers which grow here afford nutriment to innumerable
swarms of Bees, which are about the bigness of small Flies. Their Honey,
which is somewhat tart, they hide in the Roots of Trees, or in the
Earth. Another sort, which is made by the Wasps, bereaves those that
taste of their Senses.

[Sidenote: Beasts.]

The noted’st Beast in this Countrey is the _Danta_, which resembles a
Mule, hath no Horns, but Ash-colour’d long Hair, short Neck, hanging
Ears, thin Legs, with three Claws before and two behind, long Head,
narrow Forehead, little Eyes, a Nose hanging over its Mouth, little
Tail, sharp Teeth, and a Skin which is six Fingers thick, and scarce
penetrable by any Weapon. This Beast is taken in Traps, Holes, or else
with Dogs, which he often kills when hunted towards the Water. They say
that this Beast taught Men first to Let-blood; for if it be too full of
Blood, it pricks it self against a sharp Cane, and stops up the Orifice
again very carefully. The Flesh thereof is good Meat, as also that of
the _Ross_-Lyons, which in the day-time sleep on a high Tree, where they
are shot by the _Indians_.

The Tygers are much more dangerous to be taken; yet the _Indians_
Hunting them, eat them in stead of Beef; and also through all _New
Spain_.

The Bears, which make the Ways very dangerous to travel, have black
frizled Hair, broad Tails, Feet like Mens Hands: but since the _Indians_
have made use of Guns, which they learn’d from the _Spaniards_, they
have much lessen’d the number both of Bears and Tygers.

There are likewise many Leopards, Apes, and wild Goats (whose Skins
serve the Natives for Drums) Hogs, and _Armadillo_’s.

Amongst their Fowls, are Eagles and Parrots.

The Countrey is so well stor’d with Water, that in three Leagues space
are above thirty Rivulets, and as many Fountains.

[Sidenote: Medicinal Plants.]

On the Mountains grow great quantities of _Sarsaparilla_, _Mechoacan_,
and the _China-Root_, which being yellowish hath several
Saffron-colour’d Knobs on the top. The _Sarsaparilla_ grows with many
Stalks, creeping along over the Ground; the Body thereof is tough and
full of Prickles, the Leaves broad and sharp at the ends, and are of a
bluish colour on one side, and green on the other, and bear Clusters of
Flowers, which close like Buds, and are first green, next vermilion-red,
and lastly blackish: within are two hard Stones, which inclose a white
Kernel, by the _Indians_ call’d _Juapecanga_.

The Bay _Golfo Dulce_, which pours its muddy Water into the Sea, feeds
the great Fish _Monati_, and a great number of Crocodiles.

Several Rivers abounding with Fish fall also into the same, having their
Banks set all along with Trees, in whose Boughs, joyn’d together on the
top, those sort of Birds make their Nests which prey on Fish.

The Women in this place are much shorter Liv’d than the Men, so that
there are often thirty Widowers to one Widow. Women with Child are
Deliver’d by themselves in the High-way; and from thence they go to the
next River to wash themselves and the Child.

[Sidenote: Places of note.]

As for any Towns or Places of much Traffick or Note, inhabited by the
_Spaniards_, we find not any nam’d, save onely _St. Augustines_; near
unto which there is said to be a Cave and Fountain within Ground, which
converts the Water that falleth into it out of several lesser Springs,
into a kind of Alabaster or Stone, perfectly white, and fashions it
likewise into Pillars, Statues, and other artificial Forms of very
curious Workmanship, as _Laet_ reporteth.


                               SECT. III.
                               Honduras.

[Sidenote: Situation and Bounds.]

_Honduras_ hath on the South, _Guatimala_ abovesaid; on the West, a
certain Bay, or Arm of the Sea, which they call _Golfo Dulce_, from the
abundance of fresh Waters which run into it from all Parts; on the North
and North-East, the _Atlantick Ocean_; and somewhat to the South-East,
_Nicaragua_. It contains in length, _viz._ from East to West, Coasting
along upon the Sea, about a hundred and fifty Leagues, and in breadth
eighty. The Countrey is rich both in Corn and Pasturage, being said to
be very much advantag’d that way by the constant overflowings of the
Rivers, which are very many, about _Michaelmass_-time, and which the
People order so well, that they water their Gardens, and exceedingly
fertilize the whole Champain, or lower part of the Grounds by them.

The fruitful Valleys of this Countrey were anciently very well
inhabited, till vast multitudes of the Natives were destroy’d by the
_Spaniards_ Cruelties, of which the Bishop _Bartholomeo de las Casas_,
in his Letter to the Emperor _Charles_ the Fifth, gives this Relation:

[Sidenote: Cruelties of the _Spaniards_.]

“The young Children (saith he) they murder’d, beating out their Brains
against the Stones; the Kings and Princes of the Countrey they either
scorch’d to death, or threw them to the Dogs to be torn in pieces; the
poor People they drove into their Houses, and then set them on fire;
those that remain’d were condemn’d to the greatest slavery imaginable,
being us’d in stead of Mules and Horses, and having greater Burdens laid
upon them than they were able to carry, insomuch that thousands of them
fell down dead under them; some out of despair running into the Woods
were famish’d, after they had kill’d and eat their Wives and Children
for Hunger. In this one Province onely they massacred above twenty
hundred thousand Men, and amongst others, Persons of Quality, which had
civilly Entertain’d them: nay, they tortur’d the poor innocent Natives
all the ways they could possibly invent, onely to know of them where
their Gold lay; particularly _Diego de Valasco_ spar’d none that ever
fell into his hands; insomuch that in a Moneths time above ten thousand
were slain by him: He hang’d thirteen Noble-men, to twelve of whom he
gave the Denomination of _The twelve Apostles_; and the chiefest of them
he call’d in a derision, _Jesus Christ_. Some they suffer’d to starve to
death, with their Heads compress’d between the cloven Barks of wild
Vines; some also they buried alive, and leaving onely their Heads to
appear above Ground, bowl’d Iron Bullets at them, and forc’d them to eat
one another; besides infinite other hellish Cruelties, too horrid and
dreadful to be recounted.”

[Sidenote: Commodities of the Countrey.]

This Countrey produces much _Maiz_, Wheat, Honey, and great
_Calabashes_, from whence the first Discoverers call’d that Sea _Golfo
de las Ybueras_, because they met with abundance of _Calabashes_,
floating on the Water, which at _Santo Domingo_ bear the Name of
_Ybueras_.

This Countrey is water’d by three Rivers, the first _Chamalucom_, which
glides by the City _San Pedro_; the second _Ulva_, inhabited on both
Shores; the third _Haguaro_, the Grounds adjacent to which would prove
very fruitful, were the Inhabitants not too lazy. In stead of a Plough
they use a long Pole, with two crooked Staves at the end, one bent
downwards and the other upwards, with which they cut and turn the Earth.
The Natives feed on several Roots, Flesh, and Vermine.

At their Feast they make themselves Drunk with a Drink made of Honey,
Noble-men heretofore onely drinking the Liquor of _Cacao_; of late it is
common, and made by all People, though never so mean. They speak several
Languages, the chiefest whereof is that of the _Chontales_, a salvage
People. They divide their Year, call’d _Joalar_, that is, _Passing_,
into eighteen Moneths, and each Moneth into twenty Days. They formerly
measur’d the Year by the Nights, and began the Year forty days sooner
than the _Europeans_.

[Sidenote: _New Valladolid._]

The Towns in this Province are 1. _New Vallodolid_, by the _Indians_
nam’d _Comayagua_, lying in a pleasant Valley under a temperate Climate.
The Cattel brought hither from _Spain_ increase exceedingly. The
Silver-Mynes are also so well stor’d, that they keep the Melting-house
in the Town always employ’d.

The Governor of this Place hath his Residence next to the
Treasury-Chamber.

_Anno 1588._ the Bishop’s See was translated hither from _Truxillo_:
Nineteen years before which _Francisco de Monteio_ sent his Lieutenant
_Alphonso de Cacenes_ thither, to build a Village half way between the
Southern and Northern Ocean; who accordingly erected the Town _Santa
Maria de Camoyagua_, near a River Navigable for _Canoos_, which
disembogues in _Puerto de Cavallos_. The remaining part of the Way to
the Haven _Fonseca_ being passable for Carrs (which was a means to
prevent many Inconveniences which us’d to happen to Travellers on the
Way between _Panama_ and _Nombre de Dios_) the _Spanish_ King was so
much concern’d at the first proposal hereof, that he sent the famous
Surveyor _Baptista Antonello_ thither, and he rather, because he
received information, that the new Way, along which they carried the
Merchandise from _Peru_, _Mexico_, and other Countreys along the South
Sea, lay very pleasantly, by reason of the brave Vineyards, Corn-Fields,
Fruit-Trees, Pastures, Streams abounding with Fish, Herds of Deer, and
Cony-Warrens; yet _Antonello_ meeting with many troubles, would not
undertake the Business.

_New Valladolid_ is adorn’d with a great Church, a Cloyster, belonging
to the Monks _De la Merced_, and handsom Streets.

[Sidenote: _Gratias a Dios._]

2. Thirty Leagues Westward from this City lies another call’d _Gratias a
Dios_, begun by Captain _Gabriel de Royas_, _Anno 1530._ that so he
might be near the Gold-Mines: But because the Natives kept the new
Inhabitants in continual alarm, and daily Storm’d the unfinished
Fortifications, _Royas_ was necessitated to leave off building any
farther, the rather, because none came to his assistance from the
neighboring Garrison.

Six years after _Gonzales de Alvarado_ undertook this Work, and built
the City on a Rocky Mountain; which, though otherwise barren, produc’d
lusty Horses and strong Mules.

[Sidenote: _St. Pedro._]

3. _San Pedro_, though lying under a hot and unwholsom Climate, us’d
formerly to be a brave City of Trade; but it is gone much to decay since
_Golfo Dolce_ hath been discover’d, because from that Bay the
Commodities are carried in Barques up into the Countrey.

[Sidenote: _Juan de Puerto de Cavallos._]

4. The Village _Juan de Puerto de Cavallos_, inhabited by Factors and
Moors: It receiv’d that Denomination, because not far from it several
Horses were forc’d to be thrown over-board in a Storm. Though it be but
ill fortifi’d, yet it hath an exceeding large Haven. Captain
_Christopher Newport_ arriving here _Anno 1591._ found two hundred
Houses, and in them a considerable Booty left, notwithstanding four
Ships richly laden had lately set Sail from thence.

Six years after _Newport_, Capt. _Ant. Sherly_ re-took the Place, and
leaving the Haven open for Pyrats, _Alphonsus Coriado_ judg’d it
convenient to remove the Trading Place to _Amatique_; he built the
Village _Thomas de Castilla_, and fortifi’d the same against all manner
of Assaults.

[Illustration: TRUXILLO.]

Behind _Cavallos_ lies the Valley _Naco_, which is exceeding fruitful,
being situate between high Mountains, where formerly was found plenty of
Silver.

[Sidenote: _Truxillo._]

5. Eastward from _Cavallos_ appears the famous City _Truxillo_, near a
large Bay; secur’d from all Storms by two Cliffs, full of Trees; the
Mouth of the Haven call’d _Joan Gil_, is above two Leagues broad, and
receives two Rivers, one from each side of the City: The Stream
_Quaimarotte_ flows Eastward, and the River _Antonio_ Westward, both
abounding in Fish. The Countrey round about produces abundance of all
sorts of Provisions, and chiefly abounds in Grapes, which are gather’d
twice a year: Eight days after _August_ they cut their Vines, which
afford them ripe Grapes again in _October_; they have two Harvests of
Corn; also Lemons and Oranges are very plentiful: The Cattel brought
hither from _Spain_ are exceedingly increas’d to an incredible number.

_Truxillo_ it self lying on a steep Mountain, is defended on that side
which respects the Sea, with a thick Wall of six Foot high; between
which and the Haven are many brambly Bushes, which prevent the access to
the Wall, onely a narrow and steep way leading up to the City, which
hath a strong Gate, guarded with two Brass Guns, and sufficiently
Fortifi’d to oppose an Enemy. The Eastern Cliff, which bends before the
Haven is call’d _Punta la Rye_, on which stands a House with a high
Beacon: Beyond the Wall Eastward, near the Haven, is a Ship-yard, before
which stands a large Woodden Cross: The Castle in which the City Store
is kept, joyns to the Wall, near unto which, within the Town appears St.
_Francis_ Church; but the Cathedral call’d _Eglesia Major_, is seen
above all other Buildings: The Houses cover’d with _Palmito_-Leaves,
have Walls of Pleited Bushes, Plaister’d over within and without: Behind
the City, where it lies open, are exceeding high Mountains.

[Sidenote: Attempts upon this place by the _English_ and _Dutch_.]

_Anno 1576._ the _English_ falling on this strong Place, carry’d a rich
Booty from thence; after which, Capt. _Anth. Sherly_ and Capt. _Will.
Parker_ ventur’d once more on the same, but being discover’d by the
Centinel, were forc’d to Retreat, not without a considerable loss: When
not long after, Captain _John Van Hoorn_ a _Hollander_, attempting the
same, had much better success; for he Weighing Anchor for _Pernambuc_,
with four Frigats, three Ketches, and a Sloop, set Sail to _Truxillo_,
where arriving, lay close before the City with his four Frigats, which
fired very fiercely on the Town; the Inhabitants of which not being
idle, kill’d three Men in one Ship, forc’d her to fall farther off from
the Castle: Whilst the Ketches and Sloop went about a Gun shot Westward
beyond the City, towards the River _Antonio_, where they Landed two
hundred and fifty Soldiers, which march’d with all speed up the Hill,
where the Castle lay which they Scal’d at Noon-day; the Besieged being
provided with seven Guns, shot, and threw Stones continually amongst
them, yet were forc’d to Retreat from the _Dutch_ Hand-granado’s: During
the storm, the Admiral himself Landed, but before he came out of the
Boat, the foremention’d Soldiers had made themselves Masters of the
Fort, with the loss of onely eight Men, and were busie Pillaging all
places they came at, and carrying their gotten Booty to a Watch-house
near the Castle on the Shore; when on a sudden a Fire happen’d in the
East part of _Truxillo_, which increas’d in such a manner, that in few
hours two third parts of the City lay in Ashes; every one then had
enough to do to save themselves, yet for all the haste they made,
several _Hollanders_ were kill’d at the blowing up of the Magazine, and
most of the Booty lost by the Fire; insomuch that they carry’d but two
hundred thirty nine Skins, six Bales of _Indigo_, eight hundred and
twenty Pounds of _Sarsaparilla_, seven Brass, and three Iron Guns, four
Clocks, and some few trifles with them; having before made an agreement
for twenty Pound of Silver, with the Governor _Joan de Miranda_, who
inform’d them, that they had not the least knowledge of the _Hollanders_
Fleet, till the Evening, when the Beacon on _Punta La Rye_ was fir’d:
Moreover, that the City was inhabited by two hundred _Spaniards_, and as
many more _Mulatoes_ and _Moors_; and that the Trade thereof was much
gone to decay, because there had been no Gallies there in two years
before.

Twenty seven Leagues from this City lies the Village _Jorgo de Olancho_,
where four thousand _Spaniards_ force Tribute from sixteen thousand
_Indians_, who possess much Gold.


                               SECT. IV.
                               Nicaragua.

[Sidenote: Situation and bounds.]

_Nicaragua_ is a County of this Province, border’d Northward with
_Honduras_; on the East, with the _Atlantick Ocean_, and part of
_Veragua_; on the South, with _Mare del Zur_; and on the West, with
_Guatimala_, being call’d by _Diego Lopez de Salzado_, _The New Kingdom
of_ Leon, and comprizing several little Territories, as _Nicoya_,
_Nequecheri_, _Mabyth_, _Deria_, _Masaya_, _Mandigua_, _Cacoloaque_,
_Cepeoco_, _Los Micos_, _Madira_, and the _Contales_. It hath few Rivers
in it, the want whereof is supply’d by the benefit of a great Lake, in
the midst of the Countrey, call’d by the _Spaniards_, _Laguna de
Nicaragua_, containing, as is suppos’d, above one hundred Leagues in
compass. It empties it self by the Port of _St. Juan_ into the
_Atlantick_ or North-Sea, but reacheth as far as the South or _Mare del
Zur_, at least within a very few Leagues; and from whence some _Spanish_
Captains are said to have made a passage, though with much difficulty,
into the Lake, and from thence to the North-Sea. It is abundantly well
stor’d with good Fish, but withal much haunted with Crocodiles; and the
Countrey about it so plentiful in all things, especially Cattel,
Cotten-Wool, Sugars, and all kind of Fruits: Amongst which, the chiefest
is the _Zeiba_, which is of so great a thickness, that fifteen Men
holding Hand in Hand, can scarce encompass the same. The _Callabashes_
ripen here in fourteen days time: The Sea along the Coast, breeds Whales
and other Sea-Monsters, which are often seen above Water.

[Sidenote: Nature of the Inhabitants.]

The Inhabitants of this Countrey, (except the _Chontales_, which live on
the Mountains, and maintain their old Salvage Customs) have for the most
part learnt the _Spanish_ Tongue and Manners, and exercise themselves in
all sorts of Arts and Siences, especially in Working of Silver, making
of Clothes, Wax-Work, and the like: From the Mountains they gather
Balsom, Liquid-Amber, Turpentine: They also drive a great Trade in
Cotton, Skins, and several sorts of Provisions, to _Panama_, and _Nombre
de Dios_.

The Lake _Laguna de Nicaragua_, which hath a hundred and seventeen
Leagues in Circumference, and round about inhabited, is by three Leagues
of Land separated from the South-Sea; and discharges its Waters into the
River _Desaguadero_, which falls into the Northern Ocean. _Alphonsus
Calera_, and _Diego Machuca de Zuaso_, were the first that Sail’d out of
the foremention’d Lake into the Sea, not without many dangers, by reason
of the great Water-falls, call’d _Rondales_, which fall into the River
_Desaguadero_, and forc’d them often times to draw their Barques over
the Land.

[Sidenote: Cities.]

The chief City is, 1. _Leon_, which is surrounded with Woods, and lies
close by the Lake; hath a great Church, five Cloysters belonging to the
_Monks, de la Mercede_, several Houses for the King’s Officers, and a
hundred and twenty thousand Families of _Indians_ which pay Tribute.
Three Leagues beyond _Leon_ appears a high spiry Mountain, from whose
top, both Morning and Evening, rises a mighty smoke, and sometimes casts
out great sulphurous Stones over the neighboring Fields, and on a sudden
mighty Flames. A _Dominican_ Monk, in hopes to get some melted Gold out
of its burning Mouth, went up the same with four of his Fraternity, and
carry’d an Iron Chain and a Kettle, which were no sooner let down into
the hole, but they were immediately melted; yet not so discourag’d, they
resolv’d to venture a second time with stronger Materials, which
nevertheless had the same, or rather worse event; for the Fire flew out
in such a manner, that the _Dominicans_ sadly scorch’d, had enough to do
to escape with Life, since which none durst presume to approach the
same.

But besides the Episcopal City _Leon_, Erected by _Franciscus
Fernandez_, 2. _Granada_ acknowledges the same Builder, and lying also
on the shore of _Laguna de Nicaragua_, is adorn’d with a Castle, Church,
and several Sugar-Mills: Not far from it lie the small Lakes _Masaya_
and _Lindiri_; the first which is inclos’d between exceeding high
Mountains, covers the Foot of the burning Mountain _Masaya_; the other
falls into _Laguna de Nicaragua_, near which is the smoky Mountain
_Munbacho_, surrounded with Fruit-Trees.

3. _&_ 4. The Towns _Jean_, and _Neuva Segovia_, which are not far from
thence, are of little consequence.

5. _Realeio_, this is, as it were, the _Chattam_ of _America_, being a
place on the South-Sea, where the King of _Spain_ hath all his Ships
built that are made of _American_ Timber, and inhabited by few or none
but Shipwrights, Mariners, and Men of that kind of Profession.

6. _&_ 7. _Nicoya_, _Avarines_.

8. _Cartago_, forty Leagues distant from _Nicoya_, and lying almost in
the midst of the _Isthmus_, or _Streight_ of _Darien_, equally distant
both from the North and South Sea; on both which it is said likewise to
have a convenient Port or Haven for Shipping.

[Sidenote: Strange manner of Dancing.]

The _Spaniards_, when first they Landed here, call’d this Countrey
_Mahomets Paradise_, because of its exceeding Fruitfulness. The _Cacao_
which they use here in stead of Money, is not unlike the Stone of an
Almond. The Inhabitants, in stead of using a Steel and Flint to strike
Fire withal, rub two pieces of Wood together so long, till one of them
is kindled; and burn the Boughs of Pine-Trees in stead of Candles.
Amongst the several Languages which they speak, the _Mexican_ is the
chiefest: Amongst their Recreations, Dancing is principal, which is
perform’d after a very strange manner, for they meet sometimes two or
three thousand together, according to the bigness of the Province, in a
spacious Field, which is made clean before for that purpose: He that
leads the Dance goes backward, and with many strange Gestures, turns
himself about, which the rest, following four and four together in a
row, imitate, whilst their _Tambores_ beat on hollow Instruments, and
sing Songs, which are first answer’d by the Ring-leader of the Dance,
and then seconded by the whole Company, each of them waving a Fan or a
_Callabash_, and being all adorn’d with Plumes of Feathers on their
Heads, and Strings with Shells about their Arms and Legs; they also act
several antick Tricks, the one, the blind Man, the other, the Cripple,
one feigns himself to be deaf, the other makes a wry Mouth, one cries,
and another laughs, whilest others drink healths in _Chocolate_, which
continues till Midnight.

[Sidenote: The Fish _Manati_.]

A King of this Countrey in former times us’d to feed the Fish _Manati_
with Bread, in the Lake _Guainabo_, where it would appear at its being
call’d _Matto_, _Matto_, which signifies _Noble-minded_, and oftentimes
carry eight or ten Boys on its Back from one side of the Lake to the
other; but being shot by a _Spaniard_ with an Arrow, never appear’d
again.

There is likewise a black Beast in this Countrey call’d _Cascu_,
resembling in some things a Hog; it hath a hard Skin, little Eyes, open
Ears, cloven Feet, short Nose, and makes such a terrible noise, that it
affrights those which hear it.

No less strange and wonderful is the Fox-Ape, which hath two Bellies one
under another; in the lowermost of which it carries its Young, which are
never brought into the World till they are able to shift for their own
Food. It hath the Body of a Fox, Feet like a Man’s Hands, and Ears like
a Batt.

It will not be amiss before we conclude with this Province, to give you
a Relation of the Discourse which hapned _Anno 1527._ between the
_Spanish_ Commander _Francisco de Monteio_ and the _Nicaraguan_ Casique
_Alquinotex_, who being a hundred and ten years old, told him, “That
before the _Spaniards_ arrival there, great numbers of his Soldiers
perish’d after a strange manner; for after having vomited abundance of
Worms, they fell down dead on a sudden: those that escap’d the Contagion
differing amongst themselves, made two Parties, which twice Engaging
with one another, each of them lost above a hundred and fifty thousand
Men. Yet both these Plagues were no ways to be compar’d to the Slaughter
which the _Spaniards_ had made amongst them.”

About the same time an _Italian_, call’d _Hieronymo Bonzo_, Lodging with
a _Nicaraguan_ Noble-man that understood the _Spanish_ Tongue, was thus
set upon by him: _What do not_ (_Oh_ Christ) _the_ Christians _do! they
no sooner get their Foot into an_ Indian_’s Hut, but they commandingly
call for Maiz, Honey, Winter-Clothes, Gold, Silver, and a Woman to cool
their lustful desires: Certainly there is nothing more vicious on
Earth_. To which _Bonzo_ gave him this Answer: _The wicked_ Spaniards
_commit oftentimes unseemly things_. The _Indian_ again suddenly
retorted, saying, _Where are any such Men to be found as good_
Spaniards? _I have never known any but wicked Villains._ To which
_Bonzo_ said, _Why have you made place for them on_ Nicaragua? Which was
thus reply’d to by the Noble-man: “All People round about took Oath on
the first News of the _Christians_ arrival, to hazard all, and fight to
the last Man, before they would be under the insupportable Yoke, with
which they had heard other Countreys were oppress’d with by them. To
which purpose they made ready Bowes, Arrows, Lances, Stones, Clubs, and
other Weapons of War: But when it came to the trial, the _Spanish_
Horse, of which they had never seen the like, struck such a terror into
the _Indians_, that they fled, and sent two Agents to _Monteio_ to
desire Peace; but their Design was onely to gain time, that they might
gather new Forces, to venture a second Encounter; which prov’d as fatal
to them as the first. Then desiring Peace once more, they gather’d all
that were able to bear Arms, and swore one to another not to stir a
Foot; and withal made a Law, That whosoever did shrink should be kill’d
immediately: But the Women being inform’d hereof, begg’d that they might
rather suffer under the _Spanish_ Yoke, than be torn in pieces by their
Dogs, or kill’d by their Bullets and Swords, alledging, that they were
not able to resist the _Spaniards_; and entreated them, that if they
were resolv’d to go on with their first Design, they would first send
their Wives and Children to the other World, that so they might not fall
into the hands of the merciless and bloody _Christians_: Whereupon most
Voices judg’d it convenient to make use of the Opportunity, and to
submit to _Monteio_. But his cruel dealings made some to contradict that
Determination, for which they paid dearly; for not onely they, but their
little Infants, were put to the most cruel Deaths imaginable; which made
many of them also to lay violent hands on themselves.”

                               Costarica.

[Sidenote: Bounds and Nature of the Countrey.]

_Costarica_ borders on the East with _Veragua_; on the South and East,
with the Sea; and on the North, with _Nicaragua_. The Countrey it self
is barren and mountainous; whose Inhabitants were valiant enough to
Encounter with the _Spanish_ Forces, being unwilling to lose their
former Priviledges.

This Coast was discover’d full by _Christopher Columbus_, who _Anno
1502._ Sailing up the Rivers _Belen_ and _Veragua_ with Barques, took
much Gold out of the Mynes _Urira_, but chiefly from between the Roots
of Trees which were grown together.


                               SECT. VI.
                                Veragua.

[Sidenote: Bounds and Nature of the Country.]

_Veragua_ is bounded on the West with _Costarica_; on the East it hath
the District, or Countrey of _Panama_, being otherwise wash’d on all
sides by the Sea. It hath its Name from a River of great note in this
Tract, by which it was first discover’d. The Countrey is for the most
part mountainous, and the Soil outwardly barren, but recompencing all
defects with the abundance of its more inward Wealth, that is to say, in
the richness of its Mynes, of which it is said to afford many, and so
inexhaustibly rich and good, that the _Spaniards_ here know no end of
their Wealth; although by the stoutness and untameableness of the
Natives, it was a long time, and they met with many difficulties, before
they could make themselves Masters of the Treasure.

[Sidenote: Its chief Towns.]

The chief Towns they have here are 1. _La Conception_, lying at the
Mouth of a River so nam’d, and the Seat of the Governor.

2. _La Trinidad_, upon the Banks of the same River likewise, but down
towards _Port Beleno_, and about six Leagues Eastward of _Conception_.

3. _St. Foy_, twelve Leagues more to the South, where the _Spaniards_
melt their Gold, and cast it into Bars or Ingots.

4. _Carlos_, a Town they have upon the Coast of _Mare del Zur_.

5. _Philippina_, another on the West of _Carlos_; both of these seated
upon a large capacious Bay; before which there lie certain little
Islands, to the number of thirty or more, which the _Spaniards_ are said
to have wholly dispeopled long since, by forcing the Natives over into
the Continent to work in the Mynes, as usually they did before the
Emperor’s Prohibition: but now they use Slaves or _Negro_’s, which they
buy for that purpose from _Guinee_ and other Parts.


                               SECT. VII.
                     Guatimala, properly so call’d.

[Sidenote: Bounds of the Country.]

_Guatimala_, specially so call’d, hath on the West the River _Xicalapa_,
which divides it from _Vera Paz_; on the East it is bounded with the
Countrey of _Nicaragua_; on the North, with _Honduras_; and on the
South, with _Mare del Zur_.

This Countrey was conquer’d by _Peter de Alvarado_, _Anno 1525._ It is,
by reason of its neighborhood with _Vera Paz_, not altogether clear of
Mountains, but otherwise well water’d with Rivers, and enrich’d with
fair and fruitful Valleys, which afford not onely good Pasturage, and
many great Herds of Cattel, but likewise good store of Wheat, _Maiz_,
and other Fruits of the Earth. Great plenty of Cotton-Wool is generally
both here and in the other Provinces, _viz._ _Vera Paz_, _Chiapa_, &c.
some Medicinal Woods likewise, and Liquors, and absolutely the best
Sulphur in _America_. The People are generally tractable and well
dispos’d, both in point of Religion and civil Government.

[Sidenote: Towns of note.]

The Towns of chief note are 1. _Guatimala_, now call’d _St. Jago de
Guatimala_ since the re-building thereof; for about the Year 1586. it
was almost buried in Ashes, which one of the neighboring Mountains, for
the space of six Moneths together, continually belch’d out in such
fearful quantities, that many People were slain, the old City deserted,
and a new one built in another place. The day before this sad Accident
hapned, the neighboring Mountains were observ’d to shiver, and a great
noise was heard from under Ground; which amazing the _Indians_, the news
thereof was carried to the Bishop, _Franciscus Moroquin_, who narrowly
enquiring into the Causes of these Accidents, and what they might
portend, found that a sad Event would suddenly follow, as accordingly it
did; for about midnight on the eighth of _August, Anno 1541._ such a
mighty store of Rain fell, as if the Clouds had been all dissolv’d into
Water, which came rowling from the Rocky Mountains with such violence,
that it wash’d down great Stones, which carried on by the strength of
the Water against the Houses, beat them down; and none could have seen
how they were ruin’d, had not the mighty flashes of Lightning, follow’d
by terrible claps of Thunder, lighted the Night. Some instantly
deserting this miserable place, fled up into the Countrey, and there
built a new _Guatimala_ (as above-mention’d) sur-nam’d _St. Jago_, three
Leagues farther towards the East, in a Valley through which flow two
Rivers, between two _Vulcans_, or smoaking Mountains, which sometimes
vomit forth terrible Flames, mix’d with dreadful Thunder-claps, Ashes,
and great Stones, insomuch that the Ground all about it, which is
exceeding fruitful, seems to move. There are many of these _Vulcans_ in
several parts of _America_, as namely at _Arequipa_ in the Kingdom of
_Peru_, at _Puebla de los Angelos_, in the Province of _Tlascalla_
abovesaid, a Mountain of so great heighth, that they are fain to go
little less than thirty Leagues turning and winding before they can
reach the top of it, and others in several other places. They are
generally Mountains of great heighth, and running sharp upwards, but at
the top containing some quantity of plain and level Ground; in the midst
whereof is a Pit or Hole, out of which abundance of Smoak and fiery
Sparkles are vomited almost continually, and so deep, that they are
suppos’d for the most part to reach to the very bottom of the Mountain.
Some of these _Vulcans_ cast forth neither Fire nor Smoak, yet are
clearly seen to burn at the bottom with a quick Fire, and which is so
extreamly hot, that it instantly melteth Iron, or any other Metal that
is cast into it, as by experience hath been found: for some conceiving
that the Matter which maintains these Fires within the Bowels of the
Earth so long together, can be nothing else but melted Gold, have
endeavor’d several times to extract and draw it forth in certain Vessels
of Iron and Brass, which they have caus’d to be let down into the bottom
of the _Vulcan_ or Pit, by long Iron Chains made on purpose: but, as we
said, the extream heat and force of the Fire below always melted them
before they could be drawn up again, and by that means hath rendred all
such Attempts frustrate. In this Town, now call’d _St. Jago_, reside
above six hundred _Spanish_ Commanders, and more than twenty five
thousand _Indians_ which pay Tribute. They have also a brave Church and
two Cloysters, one belonging to the _Dominicans_, and another to the
Order _La Merced_, and likewise a noble Hospital. Not far from thence is
a place call’d _Yzaleos_, where there are Orchards of _Cacoa_ two
Leagues in square, each of them producing yearly as much as fifty
thousand Men are able to carry. They reckon the _Cacao_ by _Contels_,
which is the number of four hundred; by _Xequipiles_, of eight thousand;
and by _Carga_’s, of twenty four thousand. In this County is a Mountain,
whose top smoaking continually consumes by degrees, and oftentimes
covers the neighboring Countrey with Ashes. The Water which flows from
the same differs very much, for some of it is wholsom and fit to drink;
some foul and stinking, and some turns Wood, if laid in the same, to
Stone. Here is also the Beast whose Head is highly esteem’d for the
_Bezoar_-Stone, which it carries in the same. Here is likewise a little
Bear, which in stead of a Mouth, hath a long Nose with a round Hole in
it, and a hollow Tongue, with which it sucks Honey, and disturbs the
Nests of Pismires. The Women in this Place make curious Earthen Ware,
colour’d either red or black with the Mud of two several Brooks. The
_Indians_ call’d the boyling Fountains in this County _Hell_, because
they bubble up a Bowes-shot high, and make the River _Caliente_, which,
notwithstanding it hath pass’d half a League through a wide Channel,
retains its exceeding heat. Not far from it lies a Stone, which having a
Crack in the middle, sends forth a thick Damp, and against bad Weather a
thundering noise. On the Mountains grow exceeding large Trees,
especially Oak. Here Pismires which are of an extraordinary bigness, are
brought to Market amongst other Provisions.

2. _St. Salvador_, forty Leagues distant from _Guatimala_ Eastward, and
seated upon the River _Guacapa_, and having about it a small Territory,
which by some is accounted a distinct Countrey or Province.

3. _Acaputla_, a Town of the Natives, situated at the Mouth of the
River, and being as it were, the Port-Town to _St. Salvador_.

4. _Trinidad_, a Town of great resort, being the greatest Empory and
Place of Traffick for all sorts of Commodities, betwixt the People of
_New Spain_ and those of _Peru_.

5. _St. Michaels_, two or three Leagues distant from the Bay _Fonseca_,
upon the South Sea.

6. _Xeres de la Frontera_, on the Confines of this Province, towards the
Borders of _Nicaragua_, besides several Villages which we shall have
occasion to mention.

In the middle of a Lake within this Territory is an Island, on which the
_Indians_ had a Tradition, That a Man no sooner set his Foot but he died
immediately: Which Opinion of theirs was chang’d when the _Spaniards_
went thither in Boat-fulls and return’d safe again, with Relation that
they had seen a large Stone Image, resembling a Woman; before which lay
the Ashes and Bones of slain People.

Round about the Village _Guaymoco_ grow great Balsom-Trees, which afford
Timber of fifty five Foot long. From this Village leads a Way to the
City _Salvador_, near which the fore-mention’d River _Guachapa_ runs
with so many windings, that the Traveller is forc’d to cross the same
several times before he can come to the Foot of a Mountain which
formerly cast out terrible Flames; but now the combustible Matter being
consum’d, there appears onely a great Hole on the top, with Ashes in a
large compass round about it. At the Foot of the same are two Pits, one
of which smoaks continually in such a manner, that it stifles all those
that approach it; yet the Mountain is well overspread with Cedars and
Pine-Trees.

Three Leagues farther lies the Village _Nixapa_; and not far from thence
the Hill _Elmal Pais_, which consists of great Stones and Ashes,
wonderfully mixt together: No less wonderful is a Brook which flows in
the Night till Morning, and then sinks into the Ground: And in the
Countrey _Choluteca_ is another, which hides it self at Noon, and
appears again towards Night. The Cavern which formerly produc’d Fire and
Smoke, now affords good Water to the Village _Curcatan_, and City
_Salvador_: Near the Village _Yztepegve_ are five Springs, which cast up
Allom and Sulphur. The Natives _Chontales_ which speak several
Languages, flock to the Village _Mimilla_, to make Offerings; not far
from hence are two Pits, one of which is full of boyling Water, and the
other as cold as Ice: Moreover, _Cocori_ lies near a high Mountain, on
the top of which is a very turbulent Lake.

[Sidenote: Havens.]

The chiefest Haven of this Countrey, which lies along the South-Sea, is
_Bahia de Fonseca_, Discover’d by _Gonsalves Davila_, _Anno 1522._ and
so nam’d from _Joan Rodrigas de Fonseca_, Bishop of _Burgos_; In the
middle thereof appears the Island _Petronella_, with nine others, of
which four are inhabited by _Indians_.

The good conveniency of the Haven _Fonseca_, induc’d some of the
_Spaniards_ to make a new Passage from the side of the Southern Ocean,
to the Northern, _viz._ from _Panama_ to _Nombre de Dios_, designing it
to reach from the said Haven _Fonseca_, unto _Puerto de Carellos_, which
are distant one from the other forty five Leagues; most of it good way,
except some over-grown Mountains, which might be made passable with
little trouble; to which purpose they built the Town _Buena Esperanca_,
yet nevertheless the Work remain’d unprosecuted.

There are moreover reckon’d as appertaining to _Guatimala_, the small
Provinces _Soconusco_, _Suchitepec_, and _Chilulteca_, the chief of them
being _Soconusco_, to which belongs the Town of _Gevetlan_, where the
_Spanish_ Governor hath his Residence; the rest seem to be onely small
Territories about Towns of the same Name, in like manner as St.
_Salvador_, and St. _Miguel_ before-mention’d.

                  The Kingdom of Mexico, or New-Spain.


[Sidenote: Bounds of _New-Spain_.]

_New Spain_, the chiefest part of the Northern _America_, reckons in
length from the East-Point of _Yucatan_, to the place where _Mechoacon_
juts against _Guadalajara_ three hundred and sixty Leagues; and in
breadth from the Northern parts of _Panucos_, to the Southern Ocean, a
hundred and eighty Leagues; besides a great part which lies to the
Northward, behind inaccessable Mountains and Wildernesses; inhabited by
the _Tepecuaenes_, _Guachucules_, _Cacatequas_, _Tecaxquines_, and
others; and was, before the _Spaniards_ Conquer’d and Dismember’d it,
much larger than now it is; for as much as it comprehended the whole
Province of _New-Gallicia_, and reach’d from the furthest Point of the
_Peninsula_ of _Jucatan_ Southward as far as _New-Biscay_, and the
Confines of _California_ Northward; containing in length seven hundred
Leagues and more, and about half as much in breadth: But since the
Conquest by _Hernando Cortez_ and his Followers, the whole Countrey of
_New-Gallicia_ is taken from it, and made a distinct Government or
_Audiencia_, as the _Spaniards_ call it, of it self.

[Illustration: NOVA HISPANIA NOVA GALACIA GVATIMALA]

[Sidenote: The Original.]

The Natives of the Countrey are of the Race of the _Chichimecæ_, a
Salvage and Wilde sort of People, of the Province of _New-Gallicia_,
especially in the Parts of _New-Biscay_, living in Forests and in deep
Caves under Ground; whose Posterity do still at this day much trouble
and annoy the Countrey thereabouts; notwithstanding all the endeavors of
the _Spaniards_, and the Garrisons which they keep in those parts on
purpose to destroy them. About five hundred years ago, or more,
according to the account of the _Mexican Annals_, divers Hoards, as they
are call’d, of these _Chichimecæ_, weary, it seems, of their Woods and
subterraneous dwellings, issu’d out into the more open Air, and fell
down in huge multitudes into these Southerly parts of _America_, which
are now call’d _Mexico_ and _New-Spain_; not all at once, but at several
times, and under several names, _viz._ of the _Suchimilci_, _Chalcæ_,
_Tepanecæ_, _Tlascaltecæ_, and others, who subduing or driving out the
People they found in those parts, Seated themselves in their room: And
though at first every Nation or Company of them, as they came, seiz’d
upon some Province apart by themselves, and held it, as it were, in
Soveraignty to themselves, without acknowledgement of any dependance or
subjection to their Neighbors, or those that were there before them; yet
in Tract of time, and by fortune of the Wars, which they made one upon
another, they fell under the Government of one King, _viz._ the King of
_Mexico_, which was the chief City of the Province.

[Sidenote: The state of the _Mexican_ Kingdom before the _Spaniards_
           arrival.]

This Kingdom, at the time that the _Spaniards_ first Discover’d the
Countrey, was Govern’d by a Prince, nam’d _Motezuma_; one, who by his
Valor and good success in the Wars, had in a few years of his Reign,
before the _Spaniards_ came thither, subdu’d the better part of a
hundred Cities and great Towns to his Dominion; and held in actual
submission to his Government, and Tributary to him, no less than thirty
several _Casiques_ or petty Princes; every one of which paid him
Tribute, and were able upon occasion to bring into the Field an hundred
thousand Men: He is said to have been, for his Person, a wise and good
Prince, just, affable, and tender of his Subjects good: but by reason of
some heavy exactions, which his own power, and the Practise of his
Ancestors before him, gave him the confidence to Impose upon the
Conquer’d People, a great part of his Subjects liv’d but unwillingly
under his Obedience, and rather by constraint than otherwise: being also
further exasperated against him by one barbarous Custom, which the
_Mexicans_ frequently us’d, _viz._ the Sacrificing of Men. Their manner
was, whensoever they had any solemn occasion of doing Honor to their
Devil-god _Vitzilopuchtli_, as they call him, to send out an Army of Men
from _Mexico_, into some of the subdu’d Provinces, (in case they had no
Enemies nearer Hand) and to fetch in as many Men as they thought good,
to be Sacrific’d; whose flesh likewise afterwards they did eat in a
solemn Banquet. This being a business of their Satanical Religion, and
_Motezuma_ a Prince extremely Superstitious and Devoted to the Service
of his gods, it is said, that he Sacrific’d commonly, one year with
another, twenty thousand Men, and some years, upon extraordinary
occasions, not less than fifty thousand: So great and grievous a
Tyranny, by the just Judgement and Permission of Almighty God, for their
great and unnatural sins, did the Enemy of Mankind exercise upon them.
He was likewise much given to Women, but it was onely to such as were
counted his Wives; of which he is said to have had no less than a
hundred and fifty with Child by him at one time.

[Sidenote: The bounds of the _Mexican_ Kingdom.]

[Sidenote: Riches of _Mexico_.]

The Bounds of this Kingdom at present are thus; on the East it hath a
large Arm of the Sea, which they call _The Bay of New-Spain_, or _The
Gulf of Mexico_; On the West, it hath some parts of _New-Gallicia_, and
_Mare del Zur_; on the North, the rest of _New-Gallicia_, and part of
_Florida_; and on the South, _Mare del Zur_ again, and part of
_Guatimala_. It extendeth it self in length from _Jucatan_ South-East,
to the Borders of _New Gallicia_ Northward, above eight hundred
_Italian_ Miles, and in breadth, from _Panuco_ to the South Sea, about
half so much. It lieth wholly under the _Torrid Zone_: nor is it a
Countrey generally so mountainous or high seated, as some others of
_America_ are but for the most part level or low; yet is it so fann’d,
(for three parts at least of four, by the cooling Blasts of the Sea, and
the Heats otherwise so moderated with frequent Rains, which it hath
constantly three Moneths in the Year, _viz._ _June_, _July_, and
_August_) that the Air is rendred thereby exceeding temperate, and the
Climate not unhealthful, especially to temperate Bodies, and such as are
never so little us’d to it. A goodly Countrey it is, of inexhaustible
Wealth and Riches, whether we regard the Mynes of Gold, Silver, Brass,
Iron, _&c._ of all which it hath many, and very good; or the Fruits of
the Earth, abundance of Cattel, plenty of Corn and Grain, of which they
have two Harvests; or any other Commodities and Endowments of Nature,
which serve for the enriching of the World. Amongst other things, it
affords _Cassia_, the Fruit whereof is a thing well known, and much
commended by the Apothecaries for its use in Physick, especially in
Purgations, and removing of all Obstructions of Phlegm, Choler, _&c._
Such store of Balm, Amber, all sorts of Gums and precious Liquors, as no
Countrey in the World is better furnish’d with excellent Perfumes and
Physick, than the Kingdom of _New Spain_.

[Sidenote: _Tunas_-Tree.]

Among the many other sorts of Trees which this Countrey produces, the
most remarkable is their _Tunas_, of which, there being five kinds, one
is call’d _Cumbeba_, from whence proceeds that admirable Tincture,
commonly known by the Name of _Cochinele_, which is thus made: On the
top of this Tree is found a Worm, which hath the bigness and shape of a
great Louse, which so increases, that in one years time a hundred Trees
shall be stock’d from the seed of one of these Animals. The Worm it self
being white, after the Skin is carefully pull’d off, put in cold Water
or Ashes, and so dry’d, becomes _Cochinele_. The best sort of it is to
be had in _Tlascala_, and that in so great a quantity, that no less than
five or six hundred _Arrobes_ of _Spanish_ Measure (each _Arrobe_ is as
much as five _English_ Bushels) is yearly Transported thence. The other
sort, which grows on the Mountains, and that which is not so carefully
gather’d, call’d _Chichimecas_, Dyes not so well as the right
_Cochinele_. The _Tunas_ also bears a Fruit long and whitish, with a
smooth Shell, and full of little Seeds like Figs: The red, which are
inferior in taste to the white, colours the Urine red.

[Sidenote: Pine-Apples.]

The Pine-Apples which grow here differ from the _Spanish_, for the Pulp
is not inclos’d in a Shell: They have a pleasant smell, and a Pulp,
which if eaten much of, causes an Appetite, it being of a tartish taste;
they keep good a long time when Salted.

[Sidenote: Fruit _Cacao_.]

But much more beneficial is the _Cacao_, with which Fruit _New Spain_
drives a great Trade; nay, serves for Coin’d Money. When they deliver a
Parcel of _Cacao_, they tell them by five, thirty, and a hundred. Their
Charity to the Poor never exceeds above one _Cacao_-Nut. The chief
reason for which this Fruit is so highly esteem’d, is for the
_Chocolate_, which is made of the same, without which the Inhabitants
(being so us’d to it) are not able to live, notwithstanding it causes
Phlegm and Vomiting to those that are strangers thereto. When the
_English_ Commander _Thomas Candish_ coming into the Haven _Guatulco_,
burnt two hundred thousand Tun of _Cacao_, it prov’d no small loss to
all _New Spain_, the Provinces _Guatimala_ and _Nicaragua_ not producing
so much in a whole year. The Trees on which this Fruit grows are divided
into four sorts, differing in bigness and shape: all of them are very
tender, for they will not onely grow in no place but on their usual
Ground, but cannot endure the cold Nights Storms, or excesses of Heat;
wherefore the _Cacao_-Trees which grow out of the Fruit that falls off,
come to no perfection, except in shady and warm Valleys; which is also
the reason why the Planters of _New Spain_ plant the great Leafy Tree
_Cacaoquanthly_ (that is, _The Mother of the Cacao_’s) near the
_Cacao_-Tree, that it may the better grow under the Shadow thereof; in
which manner whole Woods are planted: In the second year it bears Fruit,
which is first ripe in _January_, and again in the midst of Summer.
Amongst the four sorts the chiefest is _Quathuitl_, of an indifferent
heighth, and full of sharp-pointed Leaves, which are fast to the Boughs
without Stalks, and bears a great Flower of a yellowish colour, which
falling off, leaves long, tough, and hairy Threds behind them, out of
which grows the _Cacavently_, a Fruit which is oval, heavy like a Melon,
of a Saffron-colour, of a fat and thick Juice, a bitterish, yet pleasant
taste, and very cooling; being dry’d in the Sun it is thereby made fit
to keep; it is likewise highly esteem’d, because the _Chocolate_ is made
of the same. Before the _Spaniards_ made themselves Masters of _Mexico_,
no other Drink was esteem’d but that of the _Cacao_; none caring for
Wine, notwithstanding the Soil produces Vines every where in great
abundance of it self. But besides the _Quathuil_, _New Spain_ hath three
other sorts of _Cacao_-Trees, _viz._ _Mecanal_, pleasant to behold for
its heighth, large Leaves and Fruit; the next is the _Xochucaual_, which
is less than the former; and lastly the least sort, which is call’d
_Halcacahual_. The Fruit of these four sorts of Trees, though differing
in shape, yet is all one in power and operation.

[Illustration]

The _Spaniards_ to make _Chocolate_ mix _Maiz_ (by the _Mexicans_ call’d
_Tlaolli_) either whole or Ground, or boyl’d before with Chalk.
Moreover, they put the red Kernels also in the Drink, which grow in the
Fruit of the _Achiote_-Tree. Of the Kernels, which are dry and cooling,
boyl’d in Water, and stirr’d till it comes to a Pap, they make Cakes,
which mix’d with the _Chocolate_, gives it a cleansing power, and takes
away all tastes that cause vomiting.

The Pepper _Mecaxochite_, which grows creeping along the Earth, with
long and fragrant Leaves, round Stalks, hairy Roots, and three long Cods
which shoot upwards. This Pepper tempers the over-cooling property of
the _Chocolate_. Lastly, it consists also of _Xochinacatlis_,
_Tlilxochitle_, and the Rozenish Gum, _Holli_. The _Xocinacatli_ is a
Tree with small Leaves, and great Flowers hanging on long Stalks that
bend downwards, within of a purple, and without of a dark-green colour,
of a sweet smell, and resembling an Ear; and this Flower also gives a
pleasant taste and wholsom operation to the _Chocolate_. The
_Tlilxochitle_ runs up to the tops of Trees like Ivy; the Flowers, of a
darkish brown colour, cleanse the Nerves, strengthen the Brain, and take
away the rawness of the Stomach. The _Holli_ drops out of the
_Holquabuytle_, a smooth barky Tree full of Moisture, which at first
appearance is white, then yellowish, and lastly black, which kneaded
into round Balls and Roasted, is a remedy against a Loosness and
soreness of the Bowels.

[Sidenote: Nature of the People.]

The Natives of the Countrey are very ingenious in divers mechanical
Arts, especially in making of Feather-Pictures, a piece of Curiosity
wherein they are held to be incomparably, or rather inimitably
excellent; and so industrious at it, that although the _Americans_
generally are not a People over-much addicted to any kind of Labor or
Study, yet at this they will sit a whole day together, without either
Meat or Drink, onely out of a natural affection they have to the Work,
and a desire to be excellent in it; The Countrey indeed affords them
great variety of Birds and other Fowl, of most rare and exquisite
Colours, which is a great advantage to their Skill, and helps much to
the accomplishment of their Work. They Paint likewise very curiously
upon their Cottons; and are held to be generally the best Goldsmiths in
the World; of most perfect skill in the purging and refining of all
sorts of Metals, but especially of Gold and Silver: And yet in other
things so strangely stupid and ignorant, that when the _Spaniards_ first
appeared amongst them, not a few of them (as ’tis reported) took the
Horse and Man both for one Creature; and when the Horse Neighed, they
would enquire very seriously what he said.

[Sidenote: Lakes of _New-Spain_.]

There are likewise many fair Lakes in this Province, but the principal
are those of _Chapala_ and _Mexico_: the former of which is in the more
Northern parts of the Kingdom, towards the Borders of _New Gallicia_,
and is chiefly famous for the abundance of good Salt that is yearly made
and Transported thence. The other of _Mexico_ is one of the largest and
goodliest in the World, of circular form (as some say) little less than
nine hundred Miles in compass, environ’d with the main Land, the
_Peninsula_, or Cape of _Florida_, _Jucatan_, and the Island _Cuba_,
having two onely Passages in and out, and both of them well fortifi’d:
the one betwixt the Point of _Jucatan_ and the Isle _Cuba_, where the
Tyde violently enters; and the other betwixt the said Island and the
Cape of _Florida_, where it goeth as violently out: upon which Gulf the
King of _Spain_ hath always some good Ships in readiness for all
occasions; and by them, ’tis suppos’d, he doth more assure his Estates
in those parts of _America_, than by all the Garrisons besides.

The whole Kingdom of _Mexico_, or _New Spain_, is subdivided into these
Inferior Provinces:

[Sidenote: The several Provinces.]

1. The Arch-bishoprick of _Mexico_. 2. The Bishoprick, _Mechoacon_. 3.
_Los Angelos_, or _Tlascale_. 4. _Guaxaca._ 5. The Lordship _Panuco_:
And 6. the Province _Tabasco_.

_Mexico_, the chief Province of _New-Spain_, so denominated from
_Mexico_ the chief City, not only of the Province, but of all _America_;
lying between _Tlascale_ and _Mechoacan_, extends in length from North
to South, a hundred and seventeen Leagues; and in breadth along the
Southern Ocean, seventeen, but up in the Countrey, fifty four Leagues:
In which circumference lie to the North-East, _Lateotlalpa_,
_Mextitlan_, _Xilotepeque_, and _Panuco_; Westward, _Matalzingo_, and
_Cultepeque_; Eastward, _Tuzcoco_; South-East, _Chalco_; Southward,
_Suchimilco_, _Tlaluc_, _Coyxca_, and _Acapulco_.

[Illustration: NOVA MEXICO]

[Sidenote: Bounds of _Mexicana_.]

It is bounded on the East, with the Gulf of _Mexico_; on the West, with
_Mechoacan_; on the North, with _Panuco_, and some parts of
_New-Gallicia_; and on the South, with _Tlascalla_.

[Sidenote: Nature of the Countrey.]

This Countrey is both large and rich, containing not much less than one
hundred and thirty Leagues, both in length and breadth; and if it yields
any thing to _Peru_ in the plenty of Gold and Silver, ’tis certain it
much excels it in many other Commodities; as namely, in all sorts of
Fruits, abundance of Cattel, plenty of Corn and Grain; in all which, the
advantage this Countrey hath, not only of _Peru_, but of all the other
Provinces of _America_ beside, is well known: Not to speak any thing of
the great plenty and variety of good Fish, which both the Rivers and
Lakes of this Countrey afford, which is very great; insomuch, that the
very Tribute of the one Lake of _Mexico_ is said to yield an Income of
above twenty thousand Crowns yearly, one with another.

The People of the Countrey are generally Industrious and Active,
especially since the _Spaniards_ came among them; rich Merchants, if
they apply themselves to it; and they say likewise good Soldiers, when
they are train’d and imploy’d that way.

[Sidenote: Chief Towns of _Mexicana_.]

The chief Towns and places of the Province are, 1. _Mexico_, both
anciently and at present, the Metropolis and Capital City; being the
Seat of an Archbishop, and the ordinary Residence of the Vice-Roy, and
chief Governors of _New-Spain_.

[Sidenote: Description of the City _Mexico_.]

This City, by the _Indians_ was formerly call’d _Tenustatan_, lies in
nineteen Degrees and a half to the Northward of the _Equinoctial-Line_,
rais’d out of a brackish Lake, full of muddy Water; whose circumference
along the Mountains is seventy Leagues: This Lake swarms continually
with Boats, which carry the People to and again from one inhabited
Island to another; four Stone-bridges, no less costly than artificial,
with Arches and Gates in several places, lead from the City to the Main
Continent.

The fresh Water which they have in the City _Mexico_, is led into the
same through Pipes that lie in the bottom of the Lake; but none are to
enjoy the benefit thereof, before they have paid a certain Sum of Money
to the King’s Collectors.

Moreover, the City divided into Islands, contains above sixty thousand
Houses, which being built on several Isles, have large Bridges, which
reach from one to another; some that lie in the middle of the Lake, they
approach in little Boats; round about the Lake, especially where the way
leads from the Continent into the City, lie several Suburbs, all
inclos’d with Walls; between which stand strong Towers, cover’d on the
top: To keep off the force of the Water, the _Tenustatans_ have with
great labor and charge, made a Bank through the Lake, half way along the
City: But the Lake _Laguna_, from whose bottom _Mexico_ is rais’d, is
divided in two parts, the _Sweet Lake_, which is higher than the _Salt_,
falls in to the same through Sluces, with Bridges built on the Bank that
leads from the City to the main Land: The _Salt-Lake_, which hath
brackish and bitter Water, ebbs and flows according as the Wind blows;
no Fish is able to live in the same, because the Water which in the
sight of _Mexico_ falls into the same out of the Mountains, hath a
sulphury Ground: All along the shore, much Salt is made, with which the
Citizens drive a great Trade: There are continually above a hundred
thousand Boats (by the _Indians_ call’d _Acales_, and by the
_Spaniards_, _Canoos_) going off and on from one shore to another: The
fresh Water Lake, which is bigger than the salt, and feeds small Fishes,
hath above fifty Suburbs about the same, of which, some boast five
thousand, and others ten thousand Houses: Nay, the Suburb _Tescuco_, in
former times was no way inferior to _Mexico_ in bigness; since the
_Spaniards_ have been Masters of this City, they stopt up many Moats, to
inlarge their narrow Streets.

Besides three publick Markets, every open place affords all sorts of
Provisions daily; the _Indians_ call the Markets _Tianguystly_, and the
_Spaniards_, _Tianguez_; the first and chiefest stands in _Tatelulco_,
adorn’d with Galleries on three sides; in the middle of this Square,
which is accounted the biggest in the World, stands next to the place of
Execution, a stately Fountain; the Tents which are every Week pitch’d up
here for Trade, amount to above thirty thousand. The second Market
call’d St. _John_’s, is in _Mexico_, and swarms continually with People.
The third is call’d _Hipolito_, from the _Guardian-Saint_ of the City,
whither every Wednesday and Thursday comes such a multitude of People,
that this spacious Market is too little for them; for the sale of every
Commodity, a peculiar corner is allotted; but great Packs are left to be
dispos’d of in Boats, which lie near the shore.

At the four corners of the City, at present call’d _St. John_, _St.
Maria la Rotonda_, _St. Pablo_, and _St. Sebastian_, are above four
thousand _Spanish_ Families, and thirty thousand _Indians_, besides what
inhabit _Tatelulco_, now _St. Jago_.

[Sidenote: The Temperature of the Air.]

The Air in this place is very strange; in the day time, the Sky is
generally Serene; the North Wind against the Evening brings Rain, of
which the Mountain _Tepeaquilla_ lying a little League beyond the City,
gives certain Testimonies; for when a black Cloud appears on the top
thereof, it is certain to be blown from thence over _Mexico_ with Rain:
After a moist Evening follows a Star-light Night, and a pleasant
Morning: From _September_ till _May_, it is generally dry Weather here,
but if it chances to Rain, the Rain is attended with a Storm, which
occasions a sulphurous Fogg, very unwholsom, and so dark, that one Man
cannot discern another, and causes a pain through all the Limbs, nay
sometimes Death it self; wherefore, whensoe’re it approaches, every one
keeps close in his House, or goes into the Countrey.

Moreover, it is worthy of observation, how strangely this City is
alter’d since its being Conquer’d by the _Spaniards_, and especially
when _Anno 1629._ it was overflow’d by a mighty Deluge; which alteration
by _Barnabe Cabo_, in a Letter to the _Jesuite Hernande Leon_, is thus
set forth:

[Sidenote: _Barnabe Cabo_, his Description of Mexico.]

[Sidenote: _Mexico_ overflow’d.]

_Mexico_, says he, lying in a Valley between high Mountains, hath
seventy Leagues in circumference: The Valley being Oval, is for the most
part interspers’d with Lakes, which the _Indians_, and after them the
_Spaniards_ have digg’d, only the Lake which washes _Mexico_ is natural;
and to stop the Water-falls, there are Banks and Sluces every where: The
Flood before _Mexicalcingo_ flows a Fathom and a half higher than before
_Mexico_. The four other Lakes to the Northward have much more Water
than the _Mexicalcingo_, of which, some have scarce four, others but
three Leagues in circumference; when as _Mexicalcingo_’s Lake reckons
fifteen, and _Mexico_’s sixteen. On the breaking of the Banks, _Mexico_
hath often suffer’d great damage, wherefore the Vice-Roy _de Valesco_
took special care to make a vent for the Water through the lowest
Mountains; whereupon the Countrey being Survey’d, the Northern Coast
near the Village _Gueguenoca_, was found to be the most convenient. But
about the manner of letting the Water out, the Surveyors could no ways
agree; most of them were of opinion to dig Channels, into which the
Lakes might discharge their Waters; others, thought best to make a
Gutter under Ground, which last _Valesco_ put in hand with unhappy
success, because the Laborers who under-min’d the Ground, were choak’d
with the falling in of the Sand, or stifled with the sulphurous Vapors
rising out of the Earth: Nevertheless, they gave not over the Work,
though they began it quite another way, for a _French_-Man, call’d
_Henry Martin_, advis’d to deepen the River _Quaiotitlan_, which falls
into the _Laguna_, and by that means make it a Bay, into which the
_Laguna_ might pour her over-charg’d Waters: Which design, though
contradicted by the Jesuit _John Sanchez_, was put in practice; by which
means the Water fell in a short time so much, that they could walk dry
to the Cliff _El Ponnel_, lying a League from the City; wherefore they
continually labour’d on this Work, till such time _Conde de Getues_ came
over for Vice-Roy, who judg’d the Charge to be unnecessary, nay
Commanded the Ditches to be broken down, which stopt the Water along the
Silver Mines of _Pachuca_, that he might see exactly how much it would
over-flow _Mexico_: After which the Flood rose yearly higher and higher;
till at last, _Anno 1629._ a mighty Rain falling, swole the _Laguna_ in
such a manner, that it over-whelm’d all _Mexico_, wash’d down the
Houses, all Merchandizes which could not endure the Water, were spoil’d,
and had not they had innumerable Boats to help them, thousands of People
might have perish’d in this Deluge: But at last, _Henry Martin_ restor’d
again the fore-mention’d Channel to its former Perfection, and brought
the Flood which fell down out of the Mountains within the Banks of the
River.

[Sidenote: Stately Palaces.]

_Quantitlan_ digg’d also a Channel of eight thousand Fathom long, and
made an Arch’d Sewer under Ground of the same length, which Sewer hath
at every two hundred Fathoms distance, Vent-holes, and a hole of sixty
Fathom deep, and by this means, diverting abundance of Water, they dry’d
_Mexico_ in a short time: When the Banks and Streets began no sooner to
appear, but they fell to work to raise the Ground, and to lay Bridges,
and also to build more Boats. The Citizens likewise found it convenient
to make another deep Sewer for the carrying away of more Water,
notwithstanding it requir’d twenty years labor. The River, which in a
manner runs through the middle of the City, is curb’d by a Wall; a
crooked Bridge, with many Arches, and of a long extent, leads to the
City, in which stand many brave Palaces, with pleasant Walks of Trees
about them; the Cloysters of several Orders of Fryers, appear with high
Spires and Turrets, above all other Buildings.

[Sidenote: And Monasteries.]

The _Franciscans_ have here four very sumptuous Buildings: The first,
Consecrated to St. _Francis_, stands in the uppermost part of _Mexico_,
within a large square Court, and on each a pleasant Walk of Trees: The
Cloyster it self is very high, and trebble Wall’d, with Towers and
Galleries about it: In the middle of the City stands another
Tower’d-Cloyster, call’d St. _Jago_. The third lies a little distance
from it, which being built long, hath a stately Turret, and is call’d
_Maria de Rodonda_. The fourth, not far from the first, but much
smaller, is nam’d _San Diego_; these belong to the _Franciscans_. The
_Augustin_ Monks are also no way inferior to the _Franciscans_, for
magnificent Structures, with spacious Halls, high Towers, and rich
Balconies: The first is denominated from St. _Augustine_, just behind
which appears _San Pabla_, less stately than the rest. St. _Sebastian_,
near the _Laguna_, is built in manner like a Church, whose Tower ends
like a Pyramid. The Cloyster _San Cruz_, belonging also to the
_Augustines_, built square, stands near the Market, in the middle of
which stands a stately Fountain: The Court within inviron’d with thick
Walls, amazes the beholders by the pleasantness of its situation.

Moreover, the _Dominicans_ inhabit two brave Cloysters; the chiefest
Dedicated to St. _Dominic_, is eight square; to which is adjoyning a
pretty large Church, with a Steeple: The second, which stands on one
side of _St. Jago_, and consists of three several Structures, is call’d
_Collegio de Porta Cœli_. Opposite to _St. Jago_, near the great Market
the _Jesuits_ have a stately Colledge, or High-School, where many are
brought up in the Latin and Greek Tongues, whence it is call’d, _Casa
Professa Les Estudios_.

There is also another Habitation of Religious Men, call’d _Illefonse
Sanna Noviciad_, which for State, may vie with any Royal Palace.

[Sidenote: Cloysters belonging to the _Monks_ of _La Merced_.]

The _Monks_ of _La Merced_ dwell in two Cloysters, both Consecrated to
the Virgin _Mary_, yet Sirnam’d _Montseratte_, and _Carmel_: The first
lying not far from the River, is a mean Structure, in comparison to the
last; the uppermost Tower of whose Temple appears above all other
Buildings, in the upper part of _Mexico_ near the Cloyster of St.
_Francis_.

[Sidenote: Womens Cloysters.]

The Women have also fourteen Cloysters here, the chiefest whereof is
Dedicated to _Catharine_ of _Siena_; but much more splendid is that of
_Santa Teresa_, built like an Imperial Palace; famous for its stately
Gardens, and round Fountain, which continually spouts Water. The rest,
which we shall onely name, are _La Encarnacio_, _Santa Ines_,
_Jesus-Maria_, _Laurenso_, _Las Des-calcas_, _Santa Clara_, _Juan de la
Penitentia_, _Regina Cœli_, _Santa Monica_, _las Rocogidas_, _Jeronymo_,
and _Conceptione_; besides the Almshouses, _Real de los Indios_, and
_Nostra Senora del Amor_: There are likewise eight Hospitals, _viz._ _de
Dios_, _del Spiritu Santo_, _Juan de Doys_, _de la Misericordia_, _de
san Hippolito_, and _de san Lazaro_. The three chief Churches bear the
Name of _Catharine_, _Martin_, and _Vera Cruz_; and the Clergy-men
thereto belonging, enjoy many stately Palaces, amongst which are _Juan
de Lateran_, _de Christo_, and _las Nivas_.

[Sidenote: The Vice-Roy’s Palace and Arch-bishop’s Seat.]

The Residence of the Vice-Roy which lies near the _Dominican_ Cloyster,
_Porto Cœli_, is so sumptuous a Structure, that it may stand in
competition with any of those Edifices which were so much cry’d up by
the Ancients; nevertheless, it is not to be compar’d to the
Arch-bishop’s Seat, built round like a Theatre, whose Luster expresses
the Quality of him that inhabits the same, he being Governor of the
Bishopricks of _Fascala_, _Guaxaca_, _Mechaocan_, _New Galicia_,
_Chiapa_, _Yucatan_, _Guatimala_, _Verapaz_, and the _Philippinas_. This
marvellous Structure was begun by _Ferdinand Cortesius_, but was
finish’d by _Sebastian Ramires de Fuenleal_; and not much inferior
thereunto is the _Casa de Cabildo Alameda_.

[Sidenote: The gallantry of _Mexico_ at this day.]

At present, _Mexico_ is thought to be one of the richest Cities of the
World, abounding (if reports be true) in all kind of voluptuous
gallantry and bravery, even to excess: It is suppos’d to contain about
six or seven Miles in compass, and to consist of above an hundred
thousand Houses or Families, whereof not the tenth part _Spaniards_, but
those that are, all Gentlemen, at least as to their garb and manner of
living; for they live most splendidly in all respects, both for Diet and
Apparel.

For the first, we have spoken so much already of the general plenty of
all things in the Kingdom of _New-Spain_, that pertain to this part of
pleasure, that it is not to be doubted: And for the second this may be
some instance, _viz._ that it is no extraordinary matter to see an
Hat-band or Role all of Diamonds, in some ordinary Gentlemans Hat; and
of Pearl among the common Citizens and Tradesmen. The Coaches (which
most Gentlemen keep) almost cover’d with Gold and Silver, richly beset
with Precious Stones, and within ordinarily lin’d with Cloth of Gold, or
the best _China_ Silk that can be gotten; of which Coaches, in time of
year, at the _Alameda_, as they call it, which is, as it were, _The
Hide-Park of Mexico_, and a place made of purpose for recreation and
delight, a Man shall observe not seldom, above a thousand or two
thousand Coaches, full of Ladies and Gallants coming thither onely to
take the Air, and their Pleasure, both the one and the other attended
with a numerous Train of Servants and _Mulattoes_ of both Sexes. In _la
Plateria_, which is but onely one Street in _Mexico_, nigh to the
Vice-Roy’s Palace, in less than half an hours space: with the turn of an
Eye, you may see Millions of Wealth in Gold, Silver, and Precious
Stones, in the Goldsmiths and Jewellers Shops thereabouts. In a word,
there is nothing hinders _Mexico_ from being the most absolute City in
the World for delight and bravery, but onely two Inconveniences to which
it is subject: The one is the danger of the Lake, with the Infalls
whereof it may seem to be almost continually threatned, and in the Year
1629. did actually suffer a very great calamity, the Waters breaking
through the Banks, and drowning a great part of the City, with the
destruction of much People, and the loss of all their Goods intirely,
through the avarice (as is suppos’d) of the Vice-Roy that then was, and
some other of the King’s Officers, who diverted the Money that should
have been employ’d for the fortifying and repairing of the Banks, to
their own proper uses: The other is from the nature of the Soil and
Ground it self on which it standeth; which is found to have a tincture
of _Sal_ Nitre in it, somewhat strong; and the Winds partly from the
Lake it self, and partly from the Hills about it, raising the Dust of
this Earth constantly every Evening, for many Moneths of the Year
together, so violently, that the Air is even darkned therewith for some
time: The Inhabitants are much annoy’d by it, and made subject to divers
Hypocondriacal Pains and Infirmities, and sometimes kill’d with it,
especially such as either cannot, or care not much to avoid it.

The City lieth about sixty Leagues, or a hundred and fifty Miles distant
from the _Atlantick_ or North Sea, from whence by the Port of _St. John
d’Ullua_, or _Vera Crux_, (which are the usual Landing-places) there is
a fair and easie March to _Mexico_, by the Cities of _Xalabar_,
_Perotta_, _Puebla de los Angelos_, and _Tlascalla_, all of them open
and unfortifi’d Places, (as likewise _Mexico_ it self) and the Countrey
round about very rich and well accommodated with all things.

[Sidenote: City _Chulula_.]

The next City of note in ancient times was _Chulula_, which being built
in a fruitful Plain, had above twenty thousand Dwelling-houses, and as
many more Banquetting-houses. The number of the Temples and Turrets were
equal with that of the days in the Year: The Government thereof belong’d
to a Mayor and six Aldermen, and one chief Priest; for they never went
upon the least Design before they had been at their Devotion; in which
the Priest’s Office was onely to perfume the Idols four times in twenty
four hours, _viz._ in the Morning, at Noon, after Sun-set, and at
Midnight; at which times none durst be absent, but they us’d also a
cruel Exercise on themselves, and one much more cruel on others, for on
usual Feast-days they abstain’d from Meat, Drink, and Sleep, scourg’d
their Bodies with knotted Cords after a miserable manner, evacuated
their Seed, that so they might curb all fleshly Desires, and met every
Night in a spacious place, where sitting down they wounded themselves
with Lances in their Legs and Arms, so long till the Blood gush’d out of
the same; which gathering in a Cup, they anointed their Temples
therewith, and dipt the Lances in the same, and then hung them up before
the Temple in Bundles of Straw. Of these were a great number, and the
more, because they never us’d their Lances but once. But on these Days,
which were Consecrated to the Idol _Tezcatlipuca_, every one besides the
Priests wore a new Rope made of the Hemp _Mangey_, of a Fathom long, and
a thick Knot at the end, with which they beat themselves so miserably on
their Backs, as if they intended to have broken them: After which the
Priests stay’d five days in the Temple, in which they us’d the like
cruelty, eating scarce once in twenty four hours.

Their Prisoners they us’d after a most horrid manner, _viz._ in their
Temples stood a round Stage of Stone; to the top of which they ascended
by a Square Scaffold, supported by twenty eight Pillars; behind which
appear’d thousands of Mens Heads, and amongst them the Prisoners that
were to be Offer’d sat stark naked, and guarded by several Armed Men;
three Foot from the Steps which led up to the top of the Scaffold, stood
a pyramidical Stone, (by the _Indians_ call’d _Quauxicalli_) and behind
it two round Chappels, cover’d on the top like Mitres, each had four
Holes in a large Gate, in which sat a horrid Representation, worshipp’d
by six Priests call’d _Chackalmua_, whereof one call’d _Papas_, or
_Topilzin_, whose Office was to pluck out the Hearts of the Prisoners,
being in greatest esteem, wore a red Mantle about his Body, not unlike a
long Coat, with broad Fringe, which trail’d after him upon the Ground,
and also a Crown of green and yellow Plumes on his Head; his Ears and
under Lip were likewise adorn’d with Precious Stones: The other five
appear’d in like manner with their Hands and Faces painted red, but
having Leathern _Fascia_’s about their Heads, and white Coats stitch’d
with Black on their Bodies, they might easily be distinguish’d from the
_Topilzin_; who on a sudden ran down the Stairs to the Prisoners, and
shew’d each of them an Image, (saying, _This is your God_) made of
_Bledo_ Paste, _Maiz_ and Honey, green Beads for Eyes, and Grains of
_Maiz_ for Teeth: whereupon the Prisoners were led up, and laid with
their Backs on the sharp Stone _Quauxicalli_; then the five Priests took
hold of their Leggs, Arms and Head, put woodden Collars about the
Sufferer’s Necks, whilst the _Topilzin_ shew’d Reverence to the Idol;
which done, with a sharp Stone he cut open the Breasts of the Prisoners,
who in a deplorable condition lay on the pyramidical Stone, and pulling
their Hearts out of their Bodies, shew’d the same reeking to the Sun,
and at last threw them toward the Idol, and the dead Bodies down the
Stairs, where some appointed for that purpose carried the same away; but
every one taking his own Prisoner, and roasting and boyling him, serv’d
him up to his Friends as a great Dainty.

This kind of Murdering was not onely us’d amongst the _Mexicans_, but
also by all the other neighboring _Indians_, and especially in the City
_Chulula_, which (as we have said before) signifies _The Sanctity of all
the Gods_: for in this Town six thousand Children were yearly Offer’d.

The Citizens hereof us’d to drive a great Trade, especially in
_Cochinele_.

Their Habits were several; for Persons of Note wore Cotton Coats, about
the Edges of which hung Feathers and pieces of Cony-skins: the meaner
sort went in _Nequons_, or a sort of Linnen Coats made of the hairy
Leaves of the Tree _Maguey_.

3. The City _Tezuco_, full of handsom Streets and fair Houses, is built
near the salt _Mexican_ Lake, yet hath no want of fresh Water, with
which it is supply’d by Gutters from the Mountains under Ground,
according to _Anthony Herrera_, it twice exceedeth in bigness the famous
City _Sivill_ in _Spain_.

4. _Quitlavaca_, by the _Spaniards_ call’d _Venezuela_, (because it is,
like _Venice_, surrounded with Water, and divided into several Isles,)
boasted formerly above two thousand Families: From the Town a Cawsey of
twenty Foot broad, and half a League long, leads through the Lake to the
Main Continent.

5. _Yztacpalapa_, a very populous Place, and lying part of it in the
salt Lake, and partly on the Main Land; where several fresh-water Pools
afford store of Fish, two Leagues distant from _Mexico_, to which leads
a broad Way; in the middle of which stands a Fountain, surrounded with
high Trees, which produces excellent Water.

6. _Mexicaltzingo_, situate upon the Lake _Laguna_, a Town consisting of
four thousand stately Houses.

7. _Cayocan_, in a fruitful Plain, containing six thousand, being but a
League and a half from _Yztacpalapa_: to which the neighboring Village
_Houcilopucho_ was not much inferior.

These three Places, before they were subdu’d by the _Spaniards_, boasted
many brave Temples and high Towers, whose lustre appear’d at a great
distance, but now being turn’d into Cloysters, they are inhabited by
Monks and Nuns.

The Salt made here of Earth, though not white, and onely fit to make
Pickle of, is Transported to many Places.

[Sidenote: Towns and pleasant Villages about _Mexico_.]

About _Mexico_ there are also several Villages, the chiefest of which
are 1. _Mastitlan_, a Town pleasantly seated upon the top of an huge
Mountain, in the midst of most delicate Groves and shady Woods, and
reckon’d to contain no less than thirty thousand Inhabitants in all,
dwelling either in the City, or upon the sides of the Mountain.

2. _Antepecque_; this is a Town belonging to the Marquess _de Valle_,
who is of the Posterity of _Cortez_, and said to be seated in the most
delicious place of all _New Spain_.

3. _Acapulco_, a Town seated upon the South-Sea, or _Mare del Zur_, yet
belonging to this Province. It is a haven-Town, and one of the most
frequented upon the South-Sea, situate upon a large and capacious Bay of
about a League broad at the Entrance, and affording many convenient
Stations and Docks for Shipping. At the bottom of the Bay Westward lieth
the Town, with a strong Castle very opportunely built, both for the
command and security of the Port, well wall’d and fortifi’d with
Bulwarks, and having a constant Garrison of four hundred Soldiers in it,
or thereabouts. The reason whereof, I suppose, may be chiefly this,
_viz._ that from this Port there is the greatest Traffick and
Entercourse held betwixt the _East_ and _West-Indies_, together with the
_Philippine_ Islands.

[Sidenote: Silver Mynes.]

The Countrey hath many rich Mynes of Silver in it, and some of Gold; the
chief of which are by _Herera_ reported to be these, _viz._ 1. Those of
_Puchuca_, fourteen Leagues distant from _Mexico_. 2. Of _Tasco_. 3.
_Talpuiana._ 4. _Cultepeque._ 5. _Zacualpa._ 6. _Zupanguo_, and divers
others.

The rest of the Villages are _Guatitlan_, _Tenyauca_, _Escapusalco_,
_Tacuba_, and _Suchimilco_.

[Sidenote: Strange Fountain.]

The neighboring Province _Xilotepeck_, which is exceeding fruitful, is
also famous for two Fountains, whereof one near the Village _Queretaro_
produces boyling Water, which when cool’d, is a wholsom Drink for
Cattel: The other for four years is full of Water, and for four years
after it is empty; in great rainy Seasons it is quite dry, and in
droughty Weather it overflows.

Between the Villages _Queretaro_ and _San Juan_, is a Plain which
extends it self seven Leagues in breadth, and seven in length, besides
two Leagues farther beyond _Quartero_, where a hundred thousand Head of
Cattel, and ten thousand Horses, find plentiful Pasture.

[Sidenote: The wonderful Mountain _Nevada_.]

The Mountain _Nevada_, near the City _De los Angelos_, deserves no small
admiration; for it begins at thirty Leagues end to rise exceeding high,
and being flat on the top, hath a wide gaping Mouth, whose bottom is
fathomless; from which at Sun-rising and setting rises a Smoak up
directly towards the Skie, but immediately after spreading like a Plume
of Feathers, it is dispers’d by the Wind, and no more seen till it
appears in a dusky Cloud. With the Smoak are also Ashes vomited up; yet
the Mountain is very pleasantly planted with lofty Cypress, Cedar, Oak,
and Pine-Trees. The neighboring Fields abound likewise with Wheat,
Cotton, and _Maiz_. There seldom appears any Rain here.

At the Foot of this Mountain lies the Village _Tepecco_, famous for the
Crystal and Allom gotten there. The Village _Ocotlan_ is also maintain’d
by the same: But _Tuculala_ by Gold-Mines, and fruitful Lands, which are
twice a year shaken by Earthquakes; wherefore the Inhabitants live not
in Stone Houses, but in little Straw Huts.

South-Eastward from _Nerada_ is excellent Sugar to be had, and on the
Mountain it self the famous Gum _Anime_, which drops out of a Tree
call’d _Jetaiba_, which is always green, with hard white Wood, a pale
yellow speckled Bark, three long soft Leaves hanging one over another on
one Stalk, and the Fruit on the middle of the Body. After the rainy
Season is past in _October_, then they cut a Hole in the Body of the
Tree, out of which the Gum drops: it hath a pleasant smell, and is
exceeding good against the Head-ache occasion’d by Colds.

Not far from hence appears the Valleys _Matalzingo_ and _Atzompam_,
which have excellent Pastures, in which _Diego Nunnez de Camargo_ bred
forty thousand Sheep out of two in ten years time.

And these are the chiefest Towns, Villages, and Countreys, which
surround the famous City _Mexico_.

[Sidenote: The first Foundation of the City of _Mexico_.]

Concerning the erecting of this City, the _Indians_ relate thus: That
the seventh Family of the _Navatlaca_’s, Extracted out of the Countrey
_Aztlan_, rang’d up and down not without thousands of Inconveniences,
from one Countrey to another, according to the Information which their
Sages had given their Spirit _Viztliputli_, till at last some of the
Priests straying from the Army, or rather Multitude, got into a
Wilderness, full of Brambles and Thorns, and came at length to a Place
where was a Spring of clear Water, in which the Fishes glitter’d like
Silver; where taking up their repose that Night, their Spirit inform’d
the oldest of them in a Dream, that they should find thereabouts a
_Tunal_ Tree (whose Leaves grow out of one another) under which, on a
Stone, lay the Heart of the famous Sorcerer _Copil_: This _Tunal_ Tree
should be discover’d by a Crane on the top of it, which in one Foot
should hold a Bird, and in the other a Bough of the Tree, near which
they were to build a City: The old Priest waking, and relating his
Dream, every one endeavor’d to find out the fore-mention’d Tree; at last
they found it, by discovering on the top a Crane, with spread-out Wings
looking up towards the Sun, and holding in his Claws a small Bird,
invested with curious Feathers: Whereupon they with all speed built a
Chappel of Turf and Clods of Earth, and cover’d the same with Canes, to
keep their Idol from the Weather, resolving, so soon as they could, to
build him a better Temple.

The Lake on whose Isles they setled, abounded with Fish and Fowls, which
they exchang’d with the neighboring People for Stone and Mortar for the
building of a Temple for _Viztliputzli_, and a new City; to which they
made a Cawsey in the Lake _Laguna_, and divided it into four great Wards
or Divisions, and subdivided them again into lesser; over which they
plac’d peculiar Idols, and order’d a Crane like that which they had seen
on the _Tunal_ Tree to be their City Arms. The dividing of the Wards
occasion’d great dislike amongst the Grandees, judging those to whose
lot they fell, not to be worthy of them; wherefore deserting the same,
and travelling along the Lake _Laguna_, they setled themselves at last
in a sandy Soil, which they call’d _Tlattellulco_, and entertain’d a
bitter hatred against their Countrey-men who kept the four Wards of the
new _Tenustitan_, doing them all the mischief they could; wherefore the
Assaulted were necessitated to chuse a King, that they might be the
better able to oppose their Enemies: But that they might not raise a
Discontent amongst themselves about electing a Governor, they judg’d it
fittest to take a Foreigner; amongst whom they found none so capable of
so great an Office as _Acamapixtli_, Grand-son to the King of
_Culhuacan_, whereupon sending Ambassadors thither, they obtain’d their
desires.

The new King was no sooner Crown’d, but he settled all things in order
with great Prudence, insomuch, that _Mexico_ grew daily to be more
famous and fear’d: But this sudden growth rais’d a jealousie amongst the
Neighbors, who dreaded their growing Power and Valor.

[Sidenote: Proceedings between the _Tapuneca_’s and _Mexicans_.]

The _Tapunecans_ who were also a valiant People, being the nearest to
them, and having _Azcapuzalco_ for their chief City, made it their main
design, utterly to root out the _Mexicans_, before they grew to be more
Populous and Potent; notwithstanding they had hitherto receiv’d Tribute
from them, for delivering the Lake _Laguna_ to them, which was a
quantity of Timber and Plants; yet they demanded not only more Tribute
than formerly, but also in such a manner, as was thought impossible to
have been perform’d, which was, that those Plants which were formerly
brought to them, as growing on the Land, should be set in the Water, so
as to come floating to them, as they grew, to _Ascapuzalco_, which if
they did not pay, they should expect to be all put to the Sword. The
_Mexicans_ much amaz’d hereat, and not knowing how to produce the
demanded Plants, _Viztliputzli_ inform’d the oldest Priest, that the
demands might be satisfi’d; and commanded him to throw Earth on the
Water, and to Sow Seed on the same, which at the usual time produc’d
_Maiz_, _Azi_, _Chias_, _Tomates_, and the like, with which the
_Tapunecans_ being satisfi’d, demand next a Goose, and a Hen which laid
Eggs, out of which the young ones should appear, when on the floating
Clods of Earth, the Nests came opposite to _Azcapuzalco_, which by the
advice of _Viztliputzli_, they perform’d fifty years one after another.
Mean while, _Acamapixtli_ (who had inlarg’d _Mexico_ with Streets,
Palaces, Temples, and Markets) dying, would not name any one to succeed
him, but left the choice of the Election to the Commonalty, who Crown’d
his Son _Vitzilovitli_, and Marry’d him to the King of _Tapunecans_
Daughter, that by that means they might gain his friendship, and be
eas’d of their strange Annual Tribute: Whereupon _Ayauchigual_, the King
of _Tapunecans_ Daughter being Marry’d to _Vitzilovitli_, was within
twelve Moneths deliver’d of a Son, which the Grand-father call’d
_Chimalpopoca_, which signifies _A Gun which gives Smoke_, and
afterwards was satisfi’d with two Geese, and some Fish yearly from the
_Mexicans_, onely as an Acknowledgment that they inhabited his Countrey.
_Chimalpopoca_ loosing his Parents, in his tenth year was Crown’d King,
with a Bowe and Arrows in his left Hand, and a Woodden Sword in the
right: Soon after he oblig’d his Mothers Father to be kind to the
_Mexicans_, for they being in great want for fresh Water, he had leave
by Channels to bring the same out of the Mountain _Chapultepec_, a
League distant from _Mexico_; to which purpose they made a Pipe of
Planks, and hollow Trees joyn’d together with Clay, quite through the
Lake; but this Pipe not being teight and durable, and the fresh Water by
that means mixing with the Salt, they sent Agents to _Azcapuzalco_, to
request Stones, Mortar, and Work-men to make a substantial Sewer: This
message was ill resented by the Council of _Azcapuzalco_; _What_, (said
they) _do the_ Mexicans _think, shall a rambling company of people,
which on Charity live in anothers Countrey, Command those that Govern
them to be their Servants?_ This grudge went so far, that at last they
took a Resolution without the King’s knowledge, (for he was suspected,
because of his Grand-chil’d _Chimalpopoca_) to forbid all manner of
Trade with the _Mexicans_; nay, to endeavor utterly to root them out;
yet some judg’d, that they ought to spare _Chimalpopoca_, while others
on the contrary said, _That he ought to be destroy’d, because his Father
being a_ Mexican, _he would to the utmost of his Power defend his
People_; which last being approv’d of, so troubled the King of the
_Tapunecans_, that he dy’d of grief; for the Design being soon after put
into execution, and the _Tapuneca_’s breaking in the Night into
_Chimalpopoca_’s Palace, Murder’d him; which Murder made the _Mexicans_
thirst for revenge; whereupon, setting themselves wholly against the
_Tapunecans_, they enter’d into a League with _Vezcuco_, and
_Culhuacan_, and chose _Izcoalt_, for his great Valor, for their King;
notwithstanding _Acamapixtli_ had begotten him on a Slave.

[Sidenote: _Izcoalts_ success against the _Tapanecas_.]

_Izcoalt_ was no sooner Crown’d, but he made great preparation for a
War, though against every ones Opinion, because of the Populousness of
the _Tapunecans_; yet it was concluded on, that they should request
Peace, and a place to inhabit on the main Continent, that so they might
remove from the Isles: This Request they thought could not be deny’d
them in _Azcapuzalco_, provided the _Mexicans_ brought their Gods
thither, and wholly conform’d themselves to the manners of the
_Tapunecans_, for otherwise they could expect nothing but utter Ruine:
Yet though every one else imbrac’d the Proposal, _Tlacaellel_, the
King’s Nephew, stiffly oppos’d it, alleging, that it did not agree with
the _Mexicans_ quality, to make so mean and slavish a Proffer; and that
they had best consider, first if there were no other means to be found:
and that he would willingly venture his Life in going to _Azcapuzalco_,
as a Spie, to pry into their whole Designs and Intentions, which was
perform’d accordingly; and soon after returning, he brought information,
that the _Tapunecans_ were making great preparations for War, and made
no mention at all of Peace; which news struck a general fear into all
Peoples Hearts; many desiring that they might save themselves by flight;
but _Izcoalt_ putting fresh courage into them, made an agreement with
the People, that if he was beaten by the _Tapunecans_, they should eat
him up; but if he prov’d Conqueror, they should all be at his Command;
to which all consenting, they boldly march’d with their King to the City
_Azcapuzalco_. The Front of the Army consisting of the prime Nobility,
was led by _Tlacaellel_, and the Rear _Izcoalt_ brought up, who was also
to give the sign on a Drum, when they should fall upon the Enemies; who
having ten Men to the _Mexicans_ one, suddenly Sally’d out of the Gates,
where they were so briskly entertain’d by _Tlacaellel_, that in a
confus’d manner they soon ran back into the City, whither the Conqueror
pursuing them, got within the Gates, where he put all to the Sword which
he could meet with; some fled to a steep neighboring Mountain, whither
being also follow’d, they threw down their Arms, and begg’d Quarter, to
serve the _Mexicans_ as Slaves, which was granted them, whilst _Izcoalt_
found an unvaluable Mass of Treasure in _Azcapuzalco_, and distributed
the Conquer’d Countrey amongst those who had behav’d themselves best.

This Conquest made the neighboring People jealous of the _Mexicans_,
whose Success and growing Power they dreaded.

[Sidenote: The _Cuyoacans_ utterly subdu’d by _Tlacaellel_.]

The Towns _Tacuba_ and _Cuyoacan_, though they had Governors of their
own, yet were subject to the _Tapunecans_, whose General advising those
of _Azcapuzalco_ to try another Encounter, they took up Arms again; but
before it came to a Battel, the _Cuyoacans_ play’d a subtile trick with
the _Mexicans_, for inviting them to an Idolatrous Feast, after they had
Eat, Drunk, and Danc’d, they forc’d them to put on Womens Apparel, to
their no small disgrace and ignomy; which remain’d not unreveng’d, for
the _Mexicans_ made a Poysonous Fume in the Gates of _Cuyoacan_, which
made Women with Child to Miscarry, and many to fall dangerously sick;
yet lastly, both Parties march’d into the Fields, where whilst _Izcoalt_
was elsewhere ingag’d, _Tlacaellel_ marching about, came upon the backs
of the _Cuyoacans_ with such eagerness, that they fled to a strong
Temple, which soon after was set on fire by _Tlacaellel_, who pursu’d
the Enemy ten Leagues.

This Conquest stir’d up the _Suchimilcos_, the first Family of the
_Navatlaca_’s, to stop the proceedings of the _Mexicans_, that they
might not, as they had already done to others, fall upon them; to which
purpose they thought to surprize the Conquering Army; but _Tlacaellel_
who led the Van, march’d in good Order to meet the _Suchimilcos_, fell
resolutely upon their whole Army, and after a short conflict, put them
to flight, and took the City _Suchimilco_ for _Izcoalt_, who being
Crown’d King there, Commanded the Conquer’d to make a direct Road
betwixt _Suchimilco_ and _Mexico_, of four Leagues long, both, that a
Trade might the easier be drove between these two Cities, and to keep
them the better in awe: Notwithstanding these examples, _Cuytlavacan_, a
City built at the Lake _Laguna_, trusting to the abundance of Boats,
which the Citizens knew how to use with great dexterity, daily molested
_Mexico_ with them by Water, whereupon _Izcoalt_ resolv’d to send his
Victorious Army thither, but _Tlacaellel_ opposing the same, promis’d to
subdue the Rebelling City with a considerable number of Boys, which had
skill in the managing of a _Canoo_, which being permitted him, he
accordingly made himself Master of _Cuytlavacan_, from whence the Boys
brought a great Booty, and divers Prisoners, whom they sent as an
Offering to _Vitzlipultzli_.

[Sidenote: _Tezcuco_ submits to the _Mexicans_.]

These unheard of Victories being spread far and near, mov’d _Tezcuco_
after several Skirmishes and Conflicts with _Tlacaellel_, to submit to
the _Mexican_ King, who chose the Governor thereof for his Prime
Councellor. _Izcoalt_ Deceasing, after having Reign’d twelve years, his
Son _Muteczuma_ was chosen his Successor; the Election and Coronation
being perform’d after the following manner.

[Sidenote: Coronation of _Muteczuma_.]

The new King mantled in Tygers Skins, was led into the chief Temple
before a Hearth, on which burnt Fire both Night and Day; not far from
which stood the Throne, where sitting down, he Offer’d Blood, which was
taken from his Cheeks, Ears, and Legs; after which, an Orator
Congratulated him, in the name of the Nobility; which done, they ended
the Solemnity in a great Dinner, Fire-Works, and Dancing: At the same
time it was establish’d, that all Future Coronations should be kept with
an Offering of Provisions, fetch’d by the King out of the Enemies
Countrey: wherefore _Muteczuma_ going to the Countrey _Chalco_, took
several of the Natives, whose reaking Hearts he Offer’d to
_Viztlipuztli_: Which done, the Coronation follow’d, to which an
innumerable company of People came flocking from all the neighboring
Provinces: Those which were Tributaries, brought Presents with them,
before which the Heralds carry’d the Coats of Arms belonging to the
Nobility of _Mexico_, in a good order.

[Sidenote: _Muteczuma_’s Brother taken Prisoner by those of _Chalco_.]

[Sidenote: An example of great Fidelity.]

Soon after the King’s Coronation, he march’d and fell upon _Chalco_, the
Inhabitants of which defended themselves very Valiantly, took
_Muteczuma_’s Brother, among several other Prisoners; to whom the
Conquerors proffer’d the Government; which at first he refus’d, but at
last accepted of on this condition, that a high Mast should be erected
with a Scaffold on the top, which made every one suppose, that
_Muteczuma_’s Brother did in that manner aim at a high Election, but he
at the appointed time, getting on the top of the Mast, call’d with a
loud voice, and spake to the taken _Mexicans_ which were there present
to this effect: _Chalco seeks to set me on the Throne, the Heavens will
not permit it; learn by me rather to die, than to live and be guilty of
Treason to your Countrey_: which he had no sooner said, but with some
Flowers which he held in his Hand, threw himself down from the Scaffold,
which so inrag’d the _Chalcoans_, that they immediately slew all the
other _Mexicans_ that were there present; which not long after was
reveng’d by _Muteczuma_, who not onely subdu’d _Chalco_, but several
other Provinces, leaving onely _Tlascala_ unattempted, that the
_Mexicans_ might have a neighboring Enemy to fetch Prisoners from for
their Offerings, and also by Skirmishing with them, train up their Youth
in Martial Discipline.

[Illustration]

Thus his Predecessors and he, having Conquer’d divers Provinces,
insomuch that he was now become absolute Emperor over a vast Tract of
Land, he resolv’d to settle the same in good order; to which purpose he
erected Courts of Judicature, with good Laws; built a stately Palace and
Temple; ordain’d several Customs to be observ’d in Religion; which done,
and having Reign’d twenty eight years, he Deceasing, left _Ticocic_ for
his Successor.

[Sidenote: Description of the Temple _Cu_.]

The foremention’d Temple was call’d _Cu_, being built of Stone, in form
like a Serpent, of an exceeding bigness, in the middle thereof there was
a spacious open place, and round about it Habitations, two Stories high,
the lowermost for the Inferior Priests, and the uppermost for the High
Priests; in this place also above ten thousand People Danc’d in a
Circle, on all high Feasts; four great Gates fac’d the like number of
broad Streets, each two Leagues long: On the outmost Gate stood large
Images, the Front of black Stones, Painted between each Lay with red and
yellow Colours, no less Beautiful than Artificial: On each corner of the
Temple were plac’d two Marble Statues of _Indians_, sitting with their
Arms stretch’d out, and holding a Candle, and on their Heads Plumes of
Feathers: Thirty high steps led up to a round place, set about with
Deaths-Heads, which was a Stage appointed for the slaughter of those,
whose Hearts were to be Offer’d to the Diabolical gods, and whose Heads,
their Bodies being eaten, were brought back to the Priests, who hung
them under the Stage, where every Head hanging till it dropp’d off, the
vacant place was immediately supply’d with a fresh Head. At the end of
the Stage stood two Chappels, cover’d like a _Cardinal_’s-Cap, in one of
which sate the Image of _Tiztlputzli_, and in the other _Tlaloc_, to
which led a hundred and twenty Stone steps.

But besides this stately Temple _Cu_, _Mexico_ boasted nine more,
standing not far asunder in a large Plain, all adorn’d with curious
Imagery, and set out with large Pillars, each being Dedicated to a
peculiar Idol, and built with magnificent Apartments, for the Priests to
lodge in; the chiefest of them Dedicated to an Idol call’d
_Tezeatlipuca_, or _Lord of the Humble_. This Temple was ascended to by
eighty steps, and had before it a spacious Court; within a low and broad
Gate appear’d a high Vail, which open’d into a spacious square Hall,
hung with Tapestry, at the end whereof stood large Images, and beyond
which were several Rooms, in which Assemblies met, Scholars were taught,
Judges sate, and Priests Resided.

[Sidenote: _Tlacaellel_ resigns the Kingdoms to _Ticocic_.]

[Sidenote: _Axayacan_ chosen King.]

But to return again to _Muteczuma_, his Funeral was no sooner finish’d,
but the four Prime Councellors were attended by the Commissioners of
_Tezcuco_ and _Tacuba_, in order to the Election of a new King:
_Tlacaellel_ being the chief amongst the Dukes, was by a general Vote
Saluted King, as being most worthy thereof, for his special Services
shown in behalf of the Empire of _Mexico_: But he humbly refusing the
same, was desir’d to Nominate another, whereupon he making choice of
_Ticocic_, _Muteczuma_’s eldest Son; the Council immediately bor’d a
hole through his Nose, and hung an Emrauld in the same. But before he
receiv’d the Crown, he was forc’d, according to the Custom, to fetch in
some of his Enemies for an Offering, which though he perform’d, yet he
lost more _Mexicans_ than he took Prisoners, not without sufficient
testimony of Cowardise; which being ill resented by the People, he was
Poyson’d in the fourth year of his Reign, and succeeded by his Brother
_Axayaca_, by the appointment of _Tlacaellel_; who having attain’d to a
great Age, and left the Charge of his Children to the new King, departed
this Life, to the great sorrow and grief of the whole Empire; by the
States whereof he was Bury’d with great Solemnity.

[Sidenote: His Victory against the _Teguantepecks_.]

In the mean time, _Axayaca_ went with a considerable Army to the remote
Province _Teguantepek_, to fetch Prisoners to be Offer’d at his
Coronation; and marching before alone, Challeng’d his Antagonist, the
King, to a single Combat, which he refus’d, and chose rather to fall
upon _Axayaca_ with all his Forces; whereupon, the _Mexicans_ cunningly
feign’d flight, ambuscaded themselves till the Enemies pursuing them,
gave them their desir’d advantage, for rushing out of their Ambuscade,
they set upon the _Teguantepecks_, so disorder’d, that they easily put
them to flight, and had the pursuit of them as far as _Guatulco_, a
noted Haven upon the South-Sea; from whence _Axayaca_ returning Victor,
receiv’d a Crown for a Reward; yet notwithstanding these Proofs of his
Valor, the Lord of _Tlatellulco_ Challeng’d him; whereupon he sent
Agents thither, with proffers, that since the Citizens of _Tlatellulco_
were of one Blood with the _Mexicans_, whom they deserted upon the
dividing of the Wards and Towns, just before the Election of the first
King _Acamapixtli_, they should, if they pleas’d, be receiv’d anew into
fellowship and alliance with the _Mexicans_, acknowledging one and the
same King for their Supreme Head and Governor: But the Ambassadors being
scorn’d and laugh’d at for their proffers, returning, related the same
to _Axayaca_, who immediately marching thither to take revenge, sent
part of his Army to fall on the Enemy by Water; whilst himself falling
upon them by Land, put the Lord of _Tlatellulco_, with his whole Army,
to flight, which was so closely pursu’d, that they forc’d their way into
the City with them, put the Governor to Death, and laid the Town in
Ashes; those which went by Water, having had no less success.

[Sidenote: _Autzol_ succeeds him.]

_Axayaca_, after eleven years Reign, Deceasing, bequeath’d his Crown to
_Autzol_, who sought to promote his Election by ingaging with the mighty
Province _Quaxutatlan_, whose Inhabitants, though but a little before,
they had been so bold as to demand Tribute of the _Mexicans_, yet
terrifi’d at the approach of _Autzol_’s Army, fled over an Arm of the
Sea, where they had been secure, had not _Autzol_ invented a floating
Isle of Planks, by which he got over his whole Army; upon which the
amaz’d _Quaxututlans_ immediately submitted themselves to the
_Mexicans_, who pursuing their Victory, extended their Dominions to
_Guatimala_, over a Tract of three hundred Leagues.

[Sidenote: _Autzol_’s Generosity and Magnificence.]

The new King having now subdu’d all his Enemies, and made himself
glorious by his Victories, was also ambitious to be as much extoll’d for
his Generosity and Magnificence; to which purpose he distributed all the
Wealth which was brought unto him from the neighboring Countreys,
amongst the Poor and the Nobility; to the first he gave Clothes and
Provisions; to the last, Plumes of Feathers and Arms. Moreover he caus’d
all mean Houses to be pull’d down and new ones to be built in their
places. Lastly, he consulted how to bring fresh Water into _Mexico_,
which was plac’d in a brackish Soil: Upon this Design he was so bent,
that when one of his Sages disswaded him from it, alledging, _That the
Water would drown the City_, he, in stead of following his Advice,
banish’d him his Presence, and upon his flying to _Cuyaocun_, caus’d him
to be fetch’d from thence and Executed. Then prosecuting his Design, he
cut the Ditch before _Cuyaocun_, by which means great store of fresh
Water came flowing into the Lake _Laguna_, which the Priests welcom’d
with strange Ceremonies; for some perfum’d the Water, others Offer’d
Quails Blood, whilst others play’d on several Musical Instruments, with
many other Ceremonies, which are at large describ’d in the ancient
_Mexican_ Chronicles, kept in the _Vatican_ Library at _Rome_. But the
Prophecy of the Executed Sorcerer was in a manner fulfill’d; for the
Water overwhelm’d a great part of _Mexico_, and divided the City into
Isles: But to prevent farther Mischief, _Autzoll_ caus’d Banks to be
rais’d, and Channels digg’d; and not long after, in the eleventh Year of
his Reign, he deceas’d: After which the _Mexican_ Kingdom tended towards
its period, as the ensuing Story will declare.

Amongst the _Mexican_ Nobility, _Mutexuma_, a melancholy Man, yet very
prudent, who resided in a stately Apartment near the great Temple _Cu_,
that there he might the better converse with _Viztlipuztli_, was elected
King; which he no sooner heard, but fled from hence: but being found
out, he was against his will led to the Grand Assembly, and from thence
to the holy Hearth, where for an Offering he drew Blood out of his
Cheeks, Ears, and Legs; and, according to an ancient Custom, the
_Council of State_ boring a Hole in his Nose, hung an Emerauld in the
same; after which the Lord of _Tescuco_ saluted him with a Speech; which
(since it is mention’d by _Joseph d’ Acosta_, together with several
other Speeches of Congratulation to their Kings, which were taught to
Schollars, to make them expert in their Language) it will not be amiss
to be annexed here, that of many this one may serve for a pattern of the
_Mexicans_ Eloquence, which is as followeth:

[Sidenote: The Lord of _Tescuco_ his Speech to _Muteczuma_.]


  “The great happiness, most noble _Muteczuma_, which is befall’n this
  Realm by your Election, may easily be conjectur’d from the general
  joy, none besides your self being able to undergo an Office, in the
  management whereof so much Prudence is requir’d: It is a most
  certain testimony that God loves _Mexico_, that he hath given its
  Inhabitants understanding to make such a Choice. Who can doubt, but
  that you who have expatiated through the Heavens, and convers’d with
  _Viztlipuztli_, may easily Govern us Mortals on Earth? Who can
  despair, but that the Vertue inclos’d within your Breast, will
  extend to the Widows and Orphans? Therefore rejoyce, O _Mexico_; the
  Heavens have granted us a Prince without Vice; Merciful, and not a
  Violator of the Laws; Affable, not despising common Conversation.
  And you, O King, let not this great Preferment occasion any
  alteration in your so long known Vertues: The Crown breeds care for
  the publick good; the troubles thereof must extend over the whole
  Realm, and every one in the Realm.”


[Sidenote: Preparation for the Coronation of _Muteczuma_.]

[Sidenote: His Grandeur.]

[Sidenote: The ruine of the _Mexican_ Empire prognosticated.]

_Muteczuma_ having heard out the Speech, would willingly have answer’d
the same, but could not utter a word for Tears, which gush’d from his
Eyes. Before he went out to fetch Prisoners for Offerings at his
Coronation, he first setled his Houshold Affairs. And whereas till this
time the Kings had been serv’d in their Palaces by ordinary Citizens, he
took Knights, and the chiefest of the Nobility, intending thereby to
make a distinction between the Nobility and the common People, and add
more Majesty to the Royal Dignity. This done, _Muteczuma_ marching
against a certain rebellious Province, fetch’d a considerable number of
People to be Offer’d to _Viztupuztli_. At his Return the Coronation-Day
was appointed, against which thousands of People came to _Mexico_; even
their very Enemies of _Tlascala_, _Mechoacan_, and _Tepeaca_, which were
never conquer’d by the _Mexicans_, flock’d thither in great numbers. All
those Countreys which were under Tribute bringing unvaluable Treasures,
came in vast Multitudes, which so throng’d the City, that the very tops
of the Houses were fill’d with Spectators, no King in _Mexico_ ever
going to the Throne in such splendor; nor was ever any King so much
fear’d by his Subjects, none of the common People daring to look in his
Face; neither did he ever set Foot on the Ground, but was always carried
in a Chair on the Shoulders of his prime Nobility; he never wore a Suit
of Clothes but once, nor ever us’d a Cup or Dish after it was once
foul’d; he strictly maintain’d the Laws which he had made, and often
went himself in a Disguise, to make a strict enquiry after all Affairs
whatsoever; by which means the _Mexican_ Power was now arriv’d to the
highest top: but, as other Realms, grown top-heavy with good Fortune,
turn at last topsie-turvy, just such a Misfortune befell _Mexico_; but
not without several fore-running signs of its destruction: for in the
City _Cholola_ their God _Quezalcoalt_ inform’d them, that a strange
People were coming to take possession of the _Mexican_ Dominions; and
their Soothsayers prognosticated the same, for which _Muteczuma_
committed them all to Prison, and doubtless had put them all to death,
had not they escap’d with the help of the Master of their diabolical
Art; and though they escap’d themselves, yet their Wives and Children
were all put to death upon the King’s Command: Soon after which appear’d
a mighty Comet, or blazing Star for a whole year together; the great
Temple _Cu_ was set on Fire, and burnt to the Ground none knew how; the
Water which was thrown on the same to quench it, burnt like Brimstone;
in the Skie appear’d three fiery Heads at noon-day, and out of a long
Tail shot Sparks on the Earth; the _Laguna_, between _Mexico_ and
_Texcuco_, began to swell into a Tide, which turn’d some Houses
topsie-turvy; a shrill Voice was heard in the Night crying on the Water,
_Children, your ruine is at hand; whither shall I carry you that you may
not be lost?_

[Sidenote: A miraculous story of a Bird.]

No less strange is what _d’ Acosta_ relates of a Bird presented to
_Muteczuma_, not unlike a Crane, which the Fishermen had taken on the
_Laguna_; on the shining Forehead of which there appear’d the
resemblance of two Armies Engag’d, and one defeated by the other, and
that whilst the Sages, call’d to interpret the meaning hereof, sat in
Consultation, the Bird vanish’d.

[Sidenote: Another of a Country-man.]

Moreover, there goes a Tradition, That a Countrey-man being at his
Labor, was taken up by an Eagle, and carried through the Air into a
gloomy Cave, where a Man lay fast asleep snoaring, when on a sudden he
heard a Voice afar off, saying, _Do you know that Man?_ whereupon the
Countrey-man taking special notice of the dormant Man, knew him, by the
Royal Apparel, to be _Mutexuma_; after which the Voice was heard again,
saying, _How soundly doth he sleep: the time is coming which provides
Punishments for many Crimes; burn the Snoarer with the Torch which he
holds in his Hands, he will feel no pain_: Not long after he being
inform’d hereof, and looking on his Thigh, found the same burnt, to his
no small amazement.

[Sidenote: News of the arrival of the _Spanish_ Fleet.]

Having now possess’d the Throne fourteen years, he receiv’d news of a
Fleet, and therewith a Draught of the Men and Vessels painted on Cloth.
This startling him, he immediately advis’d with his Council, who judg’d
it convenient to secure the Coast along the Southern Ocean with strong
Watches; yet nevertheless _Ferdinand Cortesius_ Landed with five hundred
Foot and sixty Horse, took the City _Potanchanum_, march’d through the
Countrey _Sicuchimalar_ to _Tascalleca_, where they had a sharp
Conflict, in which the _Spaniards_ were in great danger; and had not
they had six Field-Pieces with them, which did as much affright as hurt
the _Indians_, they had without doubt been cut off there. In
_Chiurutecal_ they were in as much danger; for certainly the _Spanish_
Army had been set upon in the Night, had not a Woman inform’d them of
it.

[Sidenote: _Muteczuma_ committed to Prison by _Cortesius_.]

Mean while _Muteczuma_ consulted with his Sorcerers to destroy
_Cortesius_ by Charms, who then was marching through _Chalco_, whereupon
a considerable number of Sorcerers went thither to the top of a high
Mountain, where, as they were beginning their Incantations and Charms,
their Idol _Tezcalipuca_ appear’d to them; and in an angry manner told
them, That _Muteczuma_ should lose his Crown and Life; and to confirm
his words, he shew’d them a dreadful spectacle; for looking about, they
saw the City in a light flame. This being told to _Muteczuma_, he
resolv’d to make himself as secure as he could, and went to meet
_Cortesius_ with costly Presents, delivering him the Crown in the
presence of all his Council; to which purpose he took one _Marina_,
experienc’d in the _Castilian_ Tongue, with him for his Interpreter; all
things then seeming to end in Friendship. But they continu’d not long in
that state; for _Cortesius_, whose whole Design was to bring _Mexico_
under the _Spaniards_ Subjection, not long after accus’d _Muteczuma_,
that _Coalcopoca_ had on his Commands storm’d the new _Spanish_ City
_Vera Crux_, which he could no way excuse; and notwithstanding
_Muteczuma_ deliver’d him _Coalcopoca_, with fifteen of his Nobles
Prisoners, who were all burnt with green Wood; yet he was committed
Prisoner, to the great discontent of the _Mexicans_, who said, “That
they were now come to a fine pass, to be thus fool’d by a few Strangers,
who had imprison’d their King, trampled upon their ancient Images,
endeavor’d to murther them all, and in despite of them brought their
mortal Enemies, the _Tascaltecans_ and _Guazuzingans_, into _Mexico_.”

[Sidenote: _Cortesius_ marches against _Velasquez_’s Party.]

About this time there were certain Ships come to _Vera Crux_, which was
a new Port-Town of this Countrey, that the _Spaniards_ had built since
their coming thither, and had Landed near upon a thousand Men; which was
an Accident that had like to have spoil’d the Design of _Cortesius_ and
all his Company at _Mexico_, these Men being sent by _James Velasquez_;
Governor of _Cuba_, expressly against _Cortesius_ and his Men, upon
pretence that they had acted not conformably to the Commission which
they had receiv’d from him, and gave him no account of their
proceedings; which in a great measure was true: for it must be
confess’d, that _Cortesius_ and his Men finding themselves to have
fall’n upon an Adventure that was certainly rich and good, and having
got such footing and interest in the Countrey already, by their Success
and Victories, and chiefly by their Confederacy with so many of the
Natives and People of the Countrey, revolted to them, did almost at
first, by a general consent, renounce their Commission, and dependency
upon _Velasquez_, and profess’d to act immediately from and for the King
of _Spain_. What pretences they had for such a Resolution, seemingly at
least irregular, is not so well known. Whatever they were, they proceed
in it, and the whole Company (excepting onely some few, who yet went
along with the rest) chuse _Cortesius_ anew for their Commander in
chief, and appoint likewise by common consent, all other Officers of
Justice, both Civil and Military, among themselves: and to give the
better colour at Court to their Proceedings, they send _Portocorrero_
and _Monteio_, two of their Principals, into _Spain_, with a rich and
noble Present to the Emperor, both to make report of the State of the
Countrey, and to procure immediate Commission from his Majesty, to
proceed; after which they advance towards Mexico, as hath been said.
_Velasquez_, being at _Cuba_, and understanding their Proceedings,
labor’d to intercept both their Messengers and Present, but could not;
and therefore sent _Pamphilius Narvaez_ with eleven Ships, and about
nine hundred or a thousand Men to apprehend _Cortesius_, and oppose his
Proceedings. This hapned about the time that the Differences were but
newly calm’d betwixt the _Spaniards_ and the People of _Mexico_; and
though it oblig’d _Cortesius_ to leave the City in a wavering and
unsetled condition, yet he took such order, that _Muteczuma_ still
remain’d under the Guard of the _Spaniards_ as before, assisted with
thousands of their Friends of _Tlascalla_, and he himself taking the
rest, and some few _Spaniards_ along with him, with undaunted courage
and resolution marches against _Narvaez_: and such was his good fortune,
that not onely _Narvaez_ became his Prisoner without much blood-shed,
but likewise all his Men joyn’d with him in his Design, through the
favour of the Chancery or supream Court of _St. Domingo_, and by the
procurement of the Licentiat _Vasquez de Ayllon_, a Judge of it, who was
sent with _Narvaez_ to accommodate the Differences. With this Recruit
_Cortesius_ marches back again to _Mexico_; but at his coming finds
things in a very bad condition; for the Citizens, gather’d together
under the Command of one _Quicuxtemoc_, had recourse to Arms, and for
three days and three Nights vex’d the _Spaniards_ with continual
Stormings, notwithstanding what-ever Commands they had to the contrary
from their imprison’d King, who at last, looking out of a Window,
endeavoring to appease them, was hurt with a Stone, of which he soon
after died, as they say, who would not have the _Spaniards_ thought to
have murder’d him, as the _Mexicans_ say they did, with divers other
Noble-men, and some of his Children, the very Night they fled. However
it were, not long after his Death, out of extream necessity, and chiefly
for want of Victuals, the _Spaniards_ were forc’d to leave the City in
the night-time, and with the loss of four hundred and fifty of their
Men, who were either slain or taken Prisoners at the passing of a
Draw-bridge, the rest making a heavy Retreat to their Friends at
_Tlascalla_. There is standing at this day in _Mexico_, upon the place
where so many of them were kill’d, a certain Hermitage, which they call
_Los Martyres_, or _The Hermitage of the Martyrs_, though but
improperly, if upon that occasion, as one of their own Writers
confesses, though he alledges no other reason.

[Sidenote: _Mexico_ taken by the _Spaniards_.]

This Retreat of the _Spaniards_ out of _Mexico_ hapned to be upon the
tenth of _July_ after mid-night, in the Year 1520. which the _Spaniards_
at _Mexico_ call _The Doleful Night_. Nevertheless the undaunted
_Cortesius_ being got, though with much difficulty and trouble, by
reason of the pursuit of the _Mexicans_ for a good part of the Way, to
his sure Friends of _Tlascalla_, neither lost his Courage, nor gave over
his Resolution of yet gaining _Mexico_, especially the way being now
laid open, and sufficient occasion given by the Death of _Muteczuma_,
and the provocations of the _Mexicans_ themselves, to make himself
absolute and sole Lord of the Place: wherefore having sent for, and
procur’d a competent Supply of fresh Soldiers from _Santo Domingo_, or
_Hispaniola_, _Almeria_, _Cuba_, and other places, being in all nine
hundred Foot, eight hundred Horse, and seventeen Pieces of Ordnance; he
joyns himself with the Auxiliary Forces of _Tlascalla_, which were no
less than a hundred thousand Men, Arm’d with Bowes and Arrows: and with
this Army marches again towards _Mexico_, and Besieges it both by Land
and Water, _viz._ with the help of thirteen _Brigantines_ or _Galliots_,
which he had built upon the Lake, and six thousand _Canoos_, or little
Boats, which his Friends and Confederates had procur’d him. By which
means, and by his Army on Land, in a short time he cut off all Provision
from the City, and after a Siege of full three Months or more, and a
most stout and obstinate resistance made by the People within, in which
they are said to have lost above a hundred thousand Men, beside those
which perish’d by Famine, Sickness, or otherwise, he took it by Storm
upon _Tuesday_ the thirteenth of _August 1521._ Sackt it first, and then
burnt it to the Ground; yet afterwards he caus’d it to be Re-built
again, far more Beautiful than at first it was; as in due place we shall
further see. They speak not of above fifty _Spaniards_ slain during the
whole Siege, six Horses, and not many _Tlascaltecans_.

[Sidenote: _Cortez_ advanc’d to Honors.]

In this manner, and with so little Charges to the Conqueror, there fell
to the Crown of _Spain_ the richest and goodliest Kingdom (one of them)
of the whole World, _viz._ the Kingdom of _Mexico_, which the Conquerors
presently nam’d _New Spain_; and in reference to which name, the
_Catholick King_ hath ever since stil’d himself in the plural number
_Hispaniarum Rex_, or _King of both Spains_; and all by the Valor,
Prudence, admirable Resolution, and happy Conduct of _Cortez_; who was
at first but a private Adventurer in the _American_ Plantations and
Discoveries, though otherwise a Gentleman of a good Family in _Spain_,
born at _Medellin_ in the Country of _Estramedura_. The Emperor
_Charles_ the Fifth, who was also then King of _Spain_, for his great
Services, endow’d him deservedly with many great and rich Territories in
the Provinces of _Tlascalla_, _Mechoacan_, and other parts thereabouts,
made him Marquess of the Valley, _viz._ of _Guaxata_, (which is his
chief Title) a rich and flourishing Province of that Countrey, Captain
General, or Commander in Chief, of all the Military Forces of
_New-Spain_, and General Discoverer of all the Maritime parts and Coasts
of _America_ towards the South-Sea, assigning him in propriety the
twelfth part of whatsoever should be discover’d, to him and his Heirs
for ever; but deny’d him the Government of _Mexico_ out of reason of
State, though ’tis said, he much desir’d it.

[Sidenote: The grand Haven _Acapulco_.]

Among the famous Havens which lie along the South Sea, and Northern
Ocean the chiefest is _Acapulco_ before-mention’d, whither all
Merchandize is sent to be transported to _China_, which is above two
thousand Leagues distant from thence; in which Voyage they generally
spend fourteen Months; four Sail, each of eight hundred Tun, appointed
for this Trade; generally two of them set Sail to _China_ in _March_,
and returning in Summer, have no sooner drop’d their Anchors, but the
other two set out from _Acapulco_, from whence the way by Land to
_Mexico_, is seventy two Leagues over steep Mountains, dangerous Rocks,
and several Rivers; the chiefest whereof are, first, _Del Papagayo_, or
_De las Balsas_, which runs exceeding strong, which the _Indians_ cross
on bundles of Canes ty’d upon _Callabashes_: Next _San Francisco_, which
though the biggest, yet hath many shallow places to wade over. The
_Mustichoes_ are no small Plagues to those that travel this way, for
their Poysonous Stings are the occasions of many Ulcerated Wounds, and
oft-times Death it self.

In this way lies also the Countrey _del Valle_, from which _Ferdinand
Cortesius_ receiv’d the Title of Earl.

[Illustration: PORTUS ACAPULCO]

The Mouth of the Haven _Acapulco_ gapes a full League North and South,
and within exceeding large, hath a nook call’d _Boca Grande_, where the
Ships Ride safe at an Anchor: More Easterly appears a Land Inlet, (by
the _Spaniards_ call’d _Puerto del Marques_) secur’d against all Winds;
near which is the City of _San Diego_, to which belongs a Fort, with six
Bulwarks, lying on a Promontory; the main of the City is one large
Street, consisting of fair and stately Houses, and leading directly to
the Haven; the Church which is of an oblong square, hath a high Steeple
in the middle.

[Sidenote: _Spilbergen_’s Expedition.]

A _Dutch_ Admiral, one _Joris Spilbergen_, after he had done the
_Spaniards_ all the mischief he could along the South Sea, ran with five
Sail under the Fort _Acapulco_, which fir’d ten Guns at him; whereupon,
the _Dutch_ Admiral Manning a Boat, with a white Flag, they agreed upon
a Cessation, and the _Spaniards_ went aboard of the Admiral, to whom
_Pedro Alvares_, and _Francisco Menendus_, having been a considerable
time in _Holland_, and speaking the Language of that Countrey very
perfect, promis’d that all his Demands should be satisfi’d; yet
_Spilbergen_ was suspicious that the _Spaniards_ had a design upon him,
wherefore he came and lay close under the Castle with his five Sail, and
made ready his Guns: But this suspicion was soon clear’d, when _Alvares_
and _Menendus_ proffer’d to stay as Hostages, till the Governor of the
Town sent the Admiral thirty Oxen, fifty Sheep, some hundreds of
Poultry, Coals, Oranges, Cittrons, and the like fresh Provisions; as
also Wood and Water; during which time, the Prisoners being set at
liberty, several Persons of Quality came to visit the Admiral, amongst
whom was Captain _Castilio_, one that had serv’d twenty years in the
_Low-Countrey_ Wars; and _Melchior Hernando_, Nephew to the Vice-Roy of
_New-Spain_, who desirous to see the Ships that durst set twice upon
_Rodrigo de Mendose_, Admiral of the King of _Spain_’s mighty Fleet,
stood amaz’d that such little Frigats durst Ingage with so many great
_Spanish_ Ships; and carry’d the Admiral’s Son to the Governor of the
City, call’d _Georgius Perro_, who civilly entertain’d him: Eight days
_Spilbergen_ spent here at _Acapulco_, admiring the courteous
Entertainment of the _Spaniards_, and the more, because that having News
but eight Moneths before of the _Dutch_ Fleet setting out, they had in
that short time made all things ready for resistance, the Fort having
seventeen Brass Guns, and four hundred Soldiers, besides many Noblemen
and Reformades, whereas at other times there us’d not to be above forty
Men, and four Guns in the same.


                               SECT. II.
                               Mechoacan.

[Sidenote: Bounds and Description of _Mechoacan_.]

The next Province of _New Spain_ is the Bishoprick of _Mechoacan_, which
hath on the North-East, _Panuco_; on the East, _Mexicana_, properly so
call’d; on the South part, _Tlascalla_; on the West, the Main Ocean, or
_Mare del Zur_; and last of all, more directly Northward, _Xalisco_,
which is a Province of _New Gallicia_: The Name signifieth in the
_American_ Language, as much as _A Fish Countrey_; and so it is, having
many fair Lakes and Rivers in it, abundantly well stor’d with Fish. The
Countrey so exceedingly pleasant and healthful, that ’tis usual for sick
Persons of other Provinces to come hither to recover their health, only
by the benefit of a good Air. The Soil so abundantly fertile of all
sorts of Grain, that of four measures of Seed, it hath been often
observ’d, they have reap’d the next Harvest, more than so many hundred
measures of the same Grain. Very well Wooded; and by reason of its many
Rivers and fresh Springs, equally rich in good Pasture: and besides
great plenty of Medicinal Herbs and Plants, it affordeth good store of
Amber nigh the Sea Coasts, Mulberry-trees, and consequently Silks; much
Honey, Wax, and divers other Commodities, both for necessity and
pleasure. The People of the Countrey are generally tall, of a strong
active Body, and a good Wit, especially in comparison of other Natives;
not unskilful in divers curious Manufactures, the most excellent
Feather-Pictures, afore-mention’d, being said to be found in this
Province. They seem more generally inclin’d to the Humors and Customs of
the _Spaniards_, than any other _Americans_; and receiv’d the Preaching
of _Christian Religion_, when time was, with much willingness; so that
the Countrey is now entirely _Christian_, and divided into several
Parishes.

[Sidenote: Languages belonging to the _Mechoacans_.]

The Languages which are spoken in _Mechoacan_ are several, as the
_Otomian_, _Chihcimian_, and the _Mexicans_, which is common through all
_New Spain_, and the _Tarascan_, a neat and brief Language, which
properly belongs to this Countrey.

[Sidenote: Tygers.]

The Lions and Wilde Dogs of this Countrey devour great numbers of Cattel
yearly, yet the greatest mischiefs happen from the Tygers, which often
fetch People out of their Houses, notwithstanding the Doors are lock’d,
for they break in thorow the Walls and Roofs, with much eagerness and
strength: Of the greatness whereof, _Jacob Bontius_ tells us this story,
That the Governor _Peter Carpentier_ set a Trap without the Walls of
_Batavia_, of great Timber, Pleited with Iron, Baiting it with a Goat;
which taking effect, the Tyger that was caught therein, impatient of
such close Imprisonment, rent the Timber, and getting out, left the Goat
untouch’d.

_Hugo Linschot_ relates, That the Tygers in the _West-Indies_ hurt no
_Spaniards_, exercising their cruelty onely on _Indians_; and that
finding a _Black_ and a _White_ Man sleeping together, they devour the
_Black_ and not the _White_: How far these assertions deserve to be
credited, may appear by an evident contradiction of the first, for it is
well known, many _Spaniards_ in the _West-Indies_ have been eaten by the
Tygers.

General _Fedreman_ marching in this Countrey at the Head of his Army,
was assaulted by a Tyger, which in despight of them all killing a
_Spaniard_, and three _Indians_, escap’d from them; no Trees serve for a
refuge against their fury, for they climb up to the top thereof, and
fetch down their Prey; their Claws are so exceeding Venomous, that
whoever is scratch’d with the same, is never to be cur’d; there is no
Beast but they will venture upon, wherefore they lie in the Bushes, from
whence they rush out upon them; but this disadvantage they have, that
most other Beasts are too nimble Footed for them, for they are a very
heavy Creature, whatever hath been deliver’d by the Ancients concerning
the Tygers swiftness.

As to the difference which they make in Humane Flesh, it is thus far
true: That they find more sweetness in Womens Breasts than other parts,
and chose a _Black_ Man before a _White_: Concerning the first, _France_
gives a sufficient testimony, when two Tygers, in the time of King
_Lewis_ the Twelfth, breaking loose, left a great number of Women lying
Breastless in the Road. The second is confirm’d by _John Johnston_’s
Relation of a strange accident that happen’d in _Bengale_, _viz._ A
_Moor_ dreaming that a Tyger fetch’d him out of the Ship, hid himself
the next Night between Decks, of which the Master asking the reason, was
inform’d concerning his Dream, which prov’d prophetick, for about
Mid-night a Tyger leapt into the Ship, and devouring the _Moor_, went
away without touching any one of the _Hollanders_, of which there were
thirty: But a Sea-man walking on the shore escap’d more wonderfully, for
a Tyger setting upon him behind, and a Crocodile before, he leaping from
betwixt them, discover’d to the Tyger the Crocodile, to whom the Tyger
directly running, and ingaging with the Crocodile, spar’d the Sea-mans
life: Notwithstanding the cruelty and mischief of these Tygers, the
_Indians_ are led by their sottish Superstition to worship them;
because, as they say, the Devil often appears to them in that shape.

[Sidenote: Squerrils.]

Besides the Tygers, the Inhabitants of _Mechaocan_ are exceedingly
molested with Squerrils, which not only carry much Fruit into their
Holes, but also under-mine the Houses, so that they often sink or fall
on one side, the mischief being the worse, because they increase daily.
Most of them bear four young at a time, which on the third day run about
for Prey, and can scarce be taken, because of their exceeding swiftness,
leaping a great distance from one Tree to another; their Tails serve
them on divers occasions; for leaping they use it like a Wing, and at
their crossing over a River, for a Sail; in tempestuous Weather, they
stop their holes therewith, to keep out the Wind.

[Sidenote: Several kinds of them.]

There are six several sorts of these Squerrils; the first call’d
_Tlilic_, cover themselves with their Tails; the second _Quapatchli_, is
as big again, and can never be made tame; the third _Techallotl_, with a
bald Tail and great Eyes; the fourth _Talmototly_, hath a thick Head,
and a Tail full of black and white streaks; the fifth _Quimitchpatlan_,
hath a little Head and long Legs, and leaping from one Tree to another,
seems to flie; the last sort call’d _Yztactechalotl_, is whitish.

[Sidenote: Foxes.]

The Foxes do also great mischief here, their Urine smells so horribly,
that forty days after, none are able to abide near the place where they
have urin’d, and on whatsoever Stuff or Cloth a drop thereof chanceth to
light, the stink can never be wash’d away.

[Sidenote: The Bird _Auras_.]

Here breeds also a sort of Birds, call’d _Auras_, which are not unlike
Moore-Hens; they flie exceeding high in the Air, feed on nought but
stinking Carrion, which they scent at a great distance; they have a
hairy Head and Neck, and ugly Face: Some of the Fowls of this Countrey
stay here all the year long, others go away, and return at certain
times.

[Sidenote: Ingenuity of the Natives.]

The Natives, since the _Spaniards_ coming thither, have gotten their
Habits and Language, learn’d all sorts of Trades; their Tables, Chests,
and Cupboards made of _Brasile_-Wood, are no way inferior to the best
that are made in _Europe_. Painting is also in great esteem amongst
them: They make handsom Clothes, Shooes, and strange Copper Locks. They
have a peculiar Art in Tilling their Ground: They teach the _Spanish_
Dogs several tricks, but not feeding them well, they cause them to run
from them, and turn wilde, whence they are call’d _Cimarrones_, because
they do much hurt to the Cattel.

The Inhabitants, when a Feaver or Ague is upon them at the highest, leap
into cold Water: against other Sicknesses they use Herbs, whose
soveraign Power Experience hath long since taught them.

Since the _Spaniards_ made _Mechoacan_ a Bishoprick, they have built
ninety four Schools, fifty Churches, several Hospitals and Cloysters,
inhabited by _Franciscan_ and _Augustin_ Monks.

There are said to be in this Bishoprick a hundred and fifty Towns or
Burroughs (besides many scatter’d Villages) most of which have
Free-Schools erected in them, for the Training up of Youth in the
_Christian_ Religion, good Literature and Arts; and few of them without
an Hospital for the Sick: of which Towns the principal are as followeth:

[Sidenote: Principal Towns.]

1. _Zinzoutza_, the Seat of the ancient Kings of _Mechoacan_. 2.
_Pascuar_, a City forty seven Leagues distant from _Mexico_, once a
Bishop’s See. 3. _Valladolid_, the Metropolis or chief City of the
Province, since the Episcopal Chair was remov’d from _Pascuar_ thither.
It lieth upon a great Lake, equal almost for bigness to that of
_Mexico_, and is about seven Leagues distant from _Pascuar_, towards the
East. 4. _St. Michaels_, a good Town, forty Leagues Westward of
_Mexico_, and in the Way to the _Zacatecas_, but lying in a Road that is
somewhat dangerous, being not a little infested with Salvages on both
sides of it. 5. _St. Philips._ 6. _La Conception de Salaya_, seventeen
Leagues distant from _Valladolid_, and a convenient Stage for
Travellers, being indeed, with the two last mention’d, built chiefly for
the defence and securing of the Countrey against the Salvages. 7.
_Guaxanata_, a Town on the Borders of _Panuco_, where there are very
rich Mynes of Silver. 8. _Leon_, another Town likewise of very rich
Mynes, twenty four Leagues distant from _Valladolid_, and threescore
from _Mexico_. 9. _Zamorra._ 10. _Villa de los Lagos_, and others.

Towards the Sea there is 1. _Acatlan_, but two Miles distant from the
Sea-Coast, and a small Town, yet by reason of a safe and very good
Harbor which it hath for Shipping, a Place of no little Trading. 2.
_Natividad_, another well known and convenient Haven upon _Mare del
Zur_, pertaining to this Province, and from whence they usually set Sail
for the _Philippine_ Islands. 3. _St. Jago de buena Speranza_, so call’d
by the _Spaniards_, perhaps from the abundance of good Pearls they found
upon this Coast. 4. _Colyma._ 5. _Zacatula_, and some others.

This Province, as we said, was at first a distinct Kingdom of it self,
yet subordinate and Tributary to that of _Mexico_; the King whereof
nam’d _Tamgaiva_, or _Bimbicha_, (as _Laet_ reporteth) at the first
coming of the _Spaniards_ thither, after the Conquest of _Mexico_,
voluntarily submitted himself to them, and was Baptiz’d. Nevertheless
afterwards, upon a pretence of I know not what Treason intended by him
against them, and which the _Spanish_ Writers themselves professedly
think to have been feigned, by command of _Nunnez de Gusman_, President
of the _Chancery_ of _Mexico_, he was most inhumanely burnt alive, and
his Kingdom seiz’d upon by the _Spaniards_.


                               SECT. III.
                               Tlascalla.

[Sidenote: Situation and Description of _Tlascalla_.]

The Bishoprick of _Tlascalla_, formerly call’d _Tlascalteca_,
_Tlaxcala_, and _Tlascalan_, is a Province of _New Spain_, which
extendeth it self entirely from one Sea to another, _viz._ from the
_Atlantick_ to _Mare del Zur_, with which it is bounded on the East and
West Parts, lying otherwise, and for the most part betwixt the Provinces
of _Mexicana_, last spoken of, and that of _Guaxata_, which followeth,
containing in length from one Sea to the other, not much less than an
hundred Leagues, and in some places fourscore in breadth; but towards
the South Sea growing much narrower. It is a Countrey exceedingly
plentiful both in Corn and Cattel, full of rich Pasturage, and so
plentifully stor’d with _Maiz_, Wheat, and other Grain, that it is
accounted as it were the Granary of _America_; besides Deer, all manner
of Venison, and great store of Fowl. There is likewise Copperess, Allom,
Silver-Mynes, _Manna_, _Anime_, and Liquid Amber, with a sweet smelling
Gum which drops out of a Tree. The Rivers feed no Fish, because they
fall with exceeding force from the Mountains; onely near _Topoyanco_, is
a deep Lake of fresh Water, inhabited round about by _Indians_, enjoying
the pleasure and profit of the many _Cumbeba_-Trees, which yield
_Cochinele_, producing yearly above two hundred thousand Duckets worth
of that Commodity. In this Lake swim black Hedge-hogs, whose Flesh is
good and wholsom to eat.

[Sidenote: The ancient State of the _Tlascallans_.]

The People of this Countrey, when the _Spaniards_ came first amongst
them, liv’d in the form of a Common-wealth, or Free-State, refusing to
be subject to the King of _Mexico_, with whom they had almost continual
War; and upon that account, as hath been said, assisted _Cortesius_ in
the Conquest of the Kingdom, without whose help ’tis most certain he had
never been able to do any thing. They enjoy therefore many special
Priviledges and Immunities more than other _Americans_ do. They pay no
Tribute, but onely a handful of Wheat yearly for every Person, by way of
acknowledgment, otherwise living, under the Protection of the
_Spaniards_, wholly in the Form of their ancient Government. In former
times they were great Man-eaters, and not onely eat the Flesh of their
Enemies, but also of one another, insomuch that Man’s-flesh hung in
publick to be sold.

[Sidenote: River _Zahuatl_.]

The River _Zahuatl_, which rushes out of the Mountain _Xicoleucalt_,
oftentimes overflows all the Countrey near it, and washes away divers
Houses. _Zahuatl_ signifies _Scabby Water_, because all those,
especially Children, that wash in the same, are sure to be Scabby. On
its Banks the _Spaniards_ have built many Houses, the fashion whereof is
now also imitated by the _Indians_ of this Province, who formerly built
quite after another manner; for they made low Houses of Earth, Wood and
Stone, with large and strange Chambers; some a Stones-cast one from
another, others close together, had narrow crooked Streets that ran
betwixt them.

[Sidenote: _Tlascallans_ Language.]

In this Province are two sorts of Languages spoken, _viz._ the
_Mexican_, and that of the _Ottomons_, who formerly deserting _Mexico_,
chose the _Tlascallans_ for their Protectors: They are a toilsom and
painful People.

To the Northward of _Tlascalla_ are Mountains, which all the year long,
except three Moneths, are cover’d with Mist; and the Woods on the tops
of them are a great shelter to Lyons, Tygers, Wolves, and wild Dogs,
call’d _Adives_, and other wild Beasts, which do much hurt to the small
Cattel. Here are also many Serpents and Adders.

The whole Province is said to contain two hundred good Towns and
Burroughs, and more than one thousand Villages, all of them exceedingly
populous, and suppos’d to contain in the whole above a Million and half
of Natives, besides _Spaniards_, who have some few Colonies in the
Countrey for securing of it.

[Sidenote: Towns and Villages.]

The chief Towns of the Province are 1. _Tlascalla_ it self, which
denominates the whole Countrey as the Metropolis, and where the Bishop’s
See was at first, till in the Year 1550. it was remov’d to _Puebla de
los Angelos_. It is a fair Town, and commodiously seated in the midst of
a large and fertile Champain of threescore Miles in compass. It
consisteth of four large and beautiful Streets or Quarters, and in the
midst of them where they all meet, hath a _Piazza_, or Market-place,
equal to that of _Mexico_, and able to receive twenty or thirty thousand
Persons conveniently, to Buy and Sell in it; and whose Shambles seldom
shew less than fifteen thousand Sheep, four thousand Oxen, and two
thousand Hogs.

2. _Puebla de los Angelos_, or _The City of Angels_, a Town built by
_Sebastian Ramirez_, a Church-man, and he that was the first President,
or chief Governor of _Mexico_, under the Crown of _Castile_. It was
built in the Year 1531. almost in the Road-way from _Vera Crux_ to
_Mexico_, and seated in a very delicate and fertile Countrey, and of a
good Air. It is a Bishop’s See, and valu’d at twenty thousand _Ducats_
of yearly Rent, the City it self suppos’d to contain about fifteen
hundred Families; where there is abundance of excellent Cloth made, and
for fineness not yielding to the best of _Spain_. Its chief Edifices
are, the Cathedral and four stately Cloysters, belonging to the
_Dominicans_, _Franciscans_, _Augustines_, and _Capuchins_; as also a
Free-School for five hundred _Indian_ Children, endow’d by _Ramirez_
with a yearly Revenue.

3. _Zempoallan_, seated upon a River of the same Name.

4. _Napalaca_, in the Valley _Ocumba_, ows its original to an _Indian_
call’d _Juan_, who at first had onely one House, and a Herd of Hogs
there, till upon his invitation, all the neighboring People came from
the tops of the Hills; insomuch, that in a short time, the place was
Peopled by thousands of Families.

5. _Guaxacingo_, all hitherto great and ancient Towns of the Natives.

6. _Segura de la Frontera_, a _Spanish_ Town, built by _Cortez_
presently upon the Conquest of _Mexico_, for the securing of the
Confines, as the Name importeth.

7. _Vera Crux_, a Town built by _Cortez_ and his Companions, at their
first Landing, and where afterwards, by a Stratagem, and out of a
resolution either to Conquer or Die in the Countrey, he caus’d all his
Ships to be burnt, that his Soldiers might not so much as think of
returning back from whence they came. The Town was at first built five
or six Leagues up within Land; but the place being found not to be so
healthful, the Inhabitants in a short time deserted it, and seated
themselves upon a Bay of the Sea, right over against _St. John D’
Ullua_.

8. _Medellin_, another _Spanish_ Town, built likewise by _Cortez_, in
memory of his own Birth-place, which was _Medellin_, a small Town of
_Estramadura_, a Province of _Spain_, but was afterwards destroy’d by
some _Spanish_ Commanders, out of malice to _Cortez_.

Lastly, _St. John D’ Ullua_, a noted, and the most usual Port to all
this Province, and likewise to the City of _Mexico_ it self, from the
North Sea: but of difficult entrance, especially to such as are not well
acquainted with the Passage, or want Guides, by reason of certain Rocks
and Quicksands, wherewith the Mouth of the Haven is said to be bar’d;
but within, the station is more safe. It hath likewise two strong
Bulwarks or Forts rais’d, on either side of the Entrance one, to defend
the Passage; besides a strong Castle, built since Captain _John Hawkins_
surpris’d twelve Ships richly Laden within the Haven, and thirteen
others that arriv’d with a new Vice-Roy from _Spain_, valu’d at near
sixty Tun of Gold, of which he might easily have made Prize, had he not
trusted to the Vice-Roys Promise, to give him all satisfaction he should
require, by which being deceiv’d, he lost all his Fleet but two Ships.

[Sidenote: Great increase of Crocodiles.]

Between _Tlascala_ and _Los Angelos_ are the Fountains, out of which the
River hath its Original, which gliding by _Machaocan_ and _Zacatula_,
falls into the South Sea: This River is so exceeding full of Crocodiles,
that they have made several places which formerly were Inhabited on its
Banks, utterly desolate; for the Females laying generally Eggs as big as
those of a Goose, increase prodigiously; and were it not that the
_Indian_ Mice, call’d _Ichneumones_, destroy’d them, they would grow
still to greater numbers: But this Animal creeping in at the Crocodiles
Mouth, eats his way out of the Belly again; Water-Serpents, Hawks,
_Buffeloes_, and especially Tygers, are also their mortal Enemies, for
they throwing the Crocodiles on their Backs, rend open their Bellies:
They are more desirous of Mans flesh here than in any other place,
because the River of _Tlascala_ hath but small store of Fish; in the day
time they lie cover’d in the Mud, from whence they rush forth, and set
upon those that happen to pass by them; they pursue the _Canoos_ in the
Water, and strike down the Rowers with their Tails.

[Sidenote: Burning Mountain _Popatepeck_.]

Eight Leagues beyond _Tlascala_, appears the Mountain _Popatepeck_,
which for ten years ceas’d smoaking, till _Anno 1540._ it broke forth in
such a manner, that the Countrey all about was terrifi’d therewith; for
it vomited not onely a black Smoak, but also horrible Flames, which
sometimes being blow’d downward, burnt the Corn in the Fields, and the
Ashes thereof flying as far as _Guaxocingo_ and _Chulula_, burnt a great
deal of the Town to the Ground; every one endeavor’d by flight to secure
themselves, with intention never to return thither again; but the Flame
and Smoak abating, Captain _Diego de Ordas_ went up to view the place,
whence the Fire was cast forth; which curiosity and presumption of his,
had like to have cost him his Life, for the sulphury Smoak breaking
forth on a sudden, had almost stifled him.

[Sidenote: Rivers of _Mexicana_.]

Moreover, the Bishoprick of _Tlascala_, is on the North Coast wash’d by
the River _Papoloava_, since call’d _Alvarado_, from a _Spanish_
Commander, who first Steer’d his Course thither: The next Stream nam’d
_Banderas_, is so call’d, because the Natives held white Clothes on
Poles, to invite the _Spaniards_ ashore. The third is _Almeria_, on
which, _Cortesius_, a year after the taking of _Mexico_, built the Town
_Medellin_, as aforemention’d.

Along the _Tlascallan_ shore, wash’d by the Northern Ocean, lie the
Isles _Blanca_, _Verde_, and _Sacrificios_: The first receiv’d its
denomination from _White Land_, the other from _Green Trees_; and the
third, because _Joan de Greyalve_, who first Discover’d _New Spain_,
Landing on this Island, found a Bloody Altar there, with Sacrific’d
People with open’d Brests, chopt off Arms and Legs.

The River _Almeria_ falling into the Ocean opposite to the
_Sacrificios_, the _Spanish_ Ships came often to an Anchor there; but in
these latter times, they have forsaken the same, because the Northern
Winds us’d to blow very hard against the shore, and spoil’d many
Vessels: But _Henry Hawks_ gives this reason, That a dreadful apparition
of Spirits frighted the _Spaniards_ from thence.

[Sidenote: The Province _Tepeaca_.]

In the Bishoprick _Tlascala_, is also compriz’d the Province _Tepeaca_,
whose Metropolis was built by _Cortez_, when with great Loss he was sent
from _Almeria_. The Soil thereabouts is barren and stony; the Water
which they have in the City, is brought in Pipes from a River which
flows out of the Mountains into the Market place. The plain Countrey
hath many good Pastures. The Inhabitants thereof speak four sorts of
Languages; of which, the commonest is the _Mexican_; others use the
_Popolucan_ or _Otoman_ Tongues.

[Sidenote: _Alyoxuan_.]

The Village _Alyoxucan_ appears afar off on a high Mountain, on whose
top is a Lake of a hundred and fifty Fathom in circumference; the Water
whereof is very cold, and of a bluish Colour, and neither Ebbs nor
Flows, to which the Villagers climb along a narrow Path.

Not far from thence, in the Plain, are two other very deep Lakes: The
first call’d _Tlacae_, is a League in circumference, and breeds delicate
white Fish, not above a Fingers length: The second nam’d _Alchichican_,
about the same bigness, which in stormy Weather is very turbulent.

[Sidenote: Strange sort of Bird.]

Amongst the Fowls of this Countrey, the most noted is a little Summer
Bird, with a long crooked Tail, speckled Feathers; feeds on nothing but
Flowers and the Dew; about Harvest time, when the Rain ceases, it hangs
fast with its Bill on a Tree, and as soon as the first Rain falls, it
revives again.

In this Countrey _Tepeaca_ are five Villages, in each of which is a
_Franciscan_ Cloyster and convenient Hospital.

In this Countrey they gather the Water in the time of the Rainy Moneths,
in a digg’d Pool, which every Morning produces little Toads with long
Tails, which in few days fall off; but these little ones growing to be
great, make a most dreadful noise in the Night: From _October_ till
_March_, not one drop of Rain falls in this Countrey; during which time,
the Northern Winds make a dry and wholsome Air, yet oftentimes a
tempestuous Sea, to the loss of many Ships.

Farther up into the Countrey, between _Vera Crux_ and _Los Angelos_,
lies the Village _Rinconanda_; and also _Xalapa_ and _Perota_ built of
Straw Houses in the middle of a Wood of Cedar and Pine-Trees, inhabited
by the _Spaniards_, for the accommodating of Travellers: To which
purpose there are likewise Inns built near the Spring _Fuente de
Otzumba_, which gushes out of a high Rock.

Not far from hence is the Populous Village _Chetula_, where a small
number of _Spaniards_ dwell amongst thousands of _Indians_, who chiefly
make use of Mules to carry their Loads.


                               SECT. IV.
                                Guaxata.

[Sidenote: Situation and Description of _Guaxata_.]

Between _Los Angelos_ and _Guatemala_, lies the Bishoprick of
_Antiquera_ or _Guaxata_ largely taken; it hath on the North, the Bay of
_Mexico_; on the South, _Mare del Zur_; on the East, _Jucatan_ and
_Chiapa_ which is one of the Provinces of _Guatimala_; on the West,
_Tlascalla_.

[Sidenote: Division.]

The Countrey extendeth it self upon the South Sea about an hundred
Leagues in length, but from the Sea to the Borders of _Tlascalla_, one
hundred and twenty; Eastward not above half so much; having a good Air,
and a Soil no less fruitful, especially in Mulberry-Trees, and abundance
of Silks, which the Countrey affordeth, more than any other Province of
_America_ besides; nor is it less rich in Mines of Gold and Silver,
there being scarce a River in the whole Countrey, but the Sands of it
are said to be Tinctur’d more or less with that yellow Metal; also
Crystal and Copperess. It yieldeth likewise great plenty of _Cassia_ and
_Cochinele_, two rich Commodities; and the People generally, if they
would take pains, might be the wealthiest, ’tis thought, of any other in
_America_: But whether it be through any voluntary contempt of Riches,
or through any natural sloathfulness, as yet they seem to Pine in the
midst of plenty, living, for the most part of them, little better than
from Hand to Mouth; nevertheless, exceeding liberal of what they have,
especially to such as bear the Habit of Religion, and attend the service
of their Souls; maintaining in a plentiful and good manner, as ’tis
said, no less than one hundred and twenty Convents of Religious Men, of
several Orders, in this onely Province; besides Hospitals, Schools for
the training up of Youth, and other places of publick Charity; it is
said also to have three hundred and fifty Villages, and near as many
brave Countrey Houses. It is subdivided into many particular Provinces;
which, because they are many and but small, in comparison of some other,
we may call _Wapentakes_, or Hundreds, rather than Provinces: The
principal whereof are these that follow, _viz._ 1. _Misteca._ 2.
_Tutepecque._ 3. _Zapoteca._ 4. _Guazacoalco._ 5. _Gueztaxatla_: and 6.
the _Valley of Guaxata_, from whence _Cortez_, after the Conquest of
_Mexico_, had his Title given him by the Emperor, _Marquess of the
Valley_. It is the richest and most pleasant part of the whole Province,
extended in a continu’d Tract together, full sixteen Leagues or more,
lying about fourscore Southward of _Mexico_, and wanting neither Mines
of Gold and Silver, nor any other of the prime and best Commodities of
the _New-World_.

[Sidenote: Languages.]

In this Countrey they speak thirteen sorts of Languages, of which the
_Mexican_ is most us’d.

[Sidenote: Poisonous Herb.]

Amongst the Plants which grow here, is an exceeding Poysonous Herb,
which kills those whosoe’re pluck it, though a long time after, that is
to say, if it be of a Years growth, it kills not before the Years end;
if a Moneth old, at the Moneths end; if a Day, on the same.

This Countrey formerly suffer’d also many inconveniencies by
Earthquakes, but of late they are somewhat abated, which the _Spaniards_
ascribe to _Martialis_, Protector of the Cathedral at _Antequera_.

_Misteca_ is divided into _Alta_ and _Baxa_, both of which have Rivers
and Brooks that afford Gold, whither the _Indian_ Women taking
Provisions, go for several days, and gather Gold in Troughs, which they
exchange at the _Spanish_ Markets for Provisions.

[Sidenote: Strange Cave.]

Not far from the Village _Cuertlavaca_, lies a high Mountain, remarkable
for a strange Cave, whose Entrance is very narrow, at the end whereof
appears a square Place of fifty Foot; upon one side whereof stand Pits
with Steps; near which begins a crooked Way of a League long; at the end
of which is a spacious Place with a Fountain of good Water; from the
Foot of which flows a small Brook: But because none have made any
farther discovery of this Cave, the other parts of it remain yet
unknown.

On the top of _St. Antonio_, the _Indians_ live with their Families in
Caves between the Rocks.

Not far from hence appear two Mountains, whose tops, though they lie at
a great distance from one another, at the bottom they are so near, that
a Man may step from one to the other.

The six Rocks _Pennoles_, formerly Garrison’d by the Kings of _Mexico_,
have Gold, Lead-Mynes, and a Root which is us’d in stead of Soap.

In the Village _Totomachiapo_, is a Cave of half a Mile long, at the end
whereof the Water prevents a farther discovery.

The Rocky Countrey _Zapotecas_ formerly bred very salvage Inhabitants,
Mantled in Furrs, but now Civiliz’d, clad after the common manner.

[Sidenote: _Americans_, whether Extracted from the ten Tribes of
           _Israel_.]

The People spread over _Guaxacualco_, _Yluta_, and _Cueztxatla_, observe
Circumcision, according to an ancient Custom; from whence some have in
vain sought for a testimony, that these _Americans_ should be originally
extracted from the scatter’d Tribes of _Israel_; but the _Tartars_ more
immediately, who at last crossing the _Straits_ of _Anian_, furnish’d
the desolate Countrey of _America_ with Inhabitants: But this Opinion is
without any probability of truth; for it will never follow from their
Circumcision, that the _Tartars_, the greatest People on Earth, must owe
their original to a few _Israelites_, Prisoners, since that Ceremony was
never thought on by them till they embrac’d the _Mahumetan_ Religion.
And though they had been Circumcis’d before _Mahomet_’s time, this would
be no testimony that they were extracted from the _Israelites_: for how
many People embrac’d Circumcision, which were never extracted from
_Abraham_’s Seed? It is affirm’d by _Diodorus Siculus_, that the
_Cholchians_; by _Philo Judæus_, the _Egyptians_; by _Herodotus_, the
_Moors_; by _Strabo_, the _Troglodytes_; by _Cyprian_, the _Phœnicians_
and _Arabians_ Circumcis’d themselves from all Antiquity, which is to
this day observ’d by some of them. It also plainly appears by the
Prophet _Jeremiah_, that the _Egyptians_, _Edomites_, _Ammonites_,
_Moabites_, and _Ishmaelites_, had the same Custom anciently amongst
them.

[Sidenote: Towns and chief Villages of _Guaxaca_.]

The Towns of principal note inhabited by the _Spaniards_ in this
Province, are 1. _Antequera_, in the Valley aforesaid, a stately City,
and beautifi’d with a fair Cathedral Church, built with Pillars of the
finest Marble, of great heighth and bigness. The River which glides by
the Walls, springing out of the Ground, runs to the Mountain _Coatlan_.
Not far from thence lies the Village _Herrera_, which boasts four
hundred _Spanish_ Families, though some say that the greatest part of
them are _Indians_, who pay the _Spaniards_ Cotton Cloaks and Nuts for
Tribute.

2. _Illephonso de los Zapotecas_, lies on a Mountain belonging to the
_Mixes_, anciently a salvage, strong, and long-bearded People, who speak
a gross Language, and in former times went naked, onely a white
Deer-skin, Tann’d in Man’s Brains, about their Middle. They maintain’d
continual War against the _Zapoteca_’s, and could never have been
subdu’d by the _Spaniards_, had it not been for their Dogs, which kept
them in such awe, that thirty _Spanish_ Soldiers ventur’d to live in
_Illephonso_ amongst thirty thousand _Mixes_, who now drive a Trade in
Cotton, _Maize_, and Gold.

3. _San Jago de Nexapa_ appears at a great distance on a high Mountain,
where also twenty Soldiers with their Dogs were wont to awe the cruel
Natives.

4. The last Place, built by _Gonzales de Sandovall_, _Anno 1522._ is
_Villa del Espiritu Santo_, Commands fifty _Indian_ Villages, which with
great difficulty were brought to submit to the _Spaniards_.

The River _Aquivicolco_ affords a convenient Harbor, the Mouth thereof
being a hundred and ninety Paces broad.

Upon the Southern Ocean is the Haven _Guatulco_, where the Ships that
Sail to _Honduras_ and _Peru_ take in their Lading. The Custom-house
belonging to this Place was first plunder’d by Sir _Francis Drake_, and
nine years after burnt by _Candish_.

The River _Ometipu_, which springing out of the Mountain _Cacatepec_,
falls into _Tepoanteque_, abounds with divers sorts of good Fish,
especially Cra-Fish. There are also reckon’d of the Natives of this
Province, no less than fifteen thousand Persons that pay Tribute to the
_Spaniards_, besides Women and Children, and also a great number of
_Spaniards_.


                                SECT. V.
                                Panuco.

[Sidenote: Bounds and Description of _Panuco_.]

_Panuco_ is the most Northerly Province of _New Spain_, by some call’d
_Guasteca_, bounded on the East with the Gulf of _Mexico_; on the West
with _Uxitipa_, a Countrey of _New Gallicia_; on the North with some
undiscover’d Countreys of _Florida_, from which it is divided by the
_River of Palms_; on the South with _Mechoacan_ and _Mexicana_. It is
call’d _Panuco_, from a River of that Name, which turning from the
Mountains _Tepecsuan_ in _New Gallicia_, and dividing _New Biscay_ from
the Province of _Zacatecas_, passeth through the midst of this Countrey
also, and at last empties it self into the Gulf.

This Countrey is reckon’d to be about fifty Leagues in length, and not
much less in breadth; of a fruitful Soil, having some Mynes of Gold in
it, and once very populous till the _Spaniards_, about the Year 1522.
dispeopled it by their insatiable cruelty.

[Sidenote: Conquest of it difficult.]

Before _Ferdinand Cortesius_, _Francis de Garay_ attempted to Conquer
this Province, but after much pains to no purpose, he return’d with but
a small remnant of those he carried with him; and though _Cortesius_
subdu’d the Countreys _Ayotetextetlatan_ and _Chila_, yet it was not
without many considerable Losses; for the Inhabitants being valiant and
cruel, not fearing the _Spanish_ Bullets, ran in amongst them, and made
great slaughter, and (according to an old Custom in _New Spain_) drank
their Blood.

[Sidenote: Barbarous Customs of the People.]

These People, on their Festival Days call’d _Raeaxipo Veliztli_, which
signifies _A Flaying of Slaves_, us’d to pull off the Skins of a certain
number of Slaves, with which they walkt about begging Alms from Hut to
Hut, and whosoever deny’d them, was sure of a Blow in the Face with the
bloody Skin; of which so long as there was but one Lappet remaining,
they went a Begging; and whatsoever they got, was employ’d in Uses and
Necessaries belonging to their Idolatry. On the foremention’d Days they
also us’d other barbarous Customs, amongst which this was one: The
Priest challenging the Slave which was to be Offer’d, to Fight for his
Life, he had one of his Feet ty’d to a great round Stone, and having a
Sword to offend, and a Shield to defend himself, Encountred with the
Priest, who was Arm’d after the same manner, whom if he conquer’d, he
not onely preferv’d his Life, but gain’d the Name of a valiant Man.

[Illustration]

[Sidenote: Strange usage of Prisoners.]

They also dealt strangely with Persons that were yearly to be Offer’d to
their Idols: for after having wash’d them, they put on them the Clothes
of the Idol, and gave them the same Name, every one honouring them as a
God; were permitted to walk up and down, but guarded by twelve Men, that
they might not escape; for then the chiefest of the Guard was to supply
the others place: Moreover, they resided in the chiefest Apartments of
the Temple, eat of the best, were serv’d like Princes, and attended
through the Towns by Persons of the greatest Quality, who led them
through the Streets; where they no sooner play’d on a little Pipe, but
all People came running to them, fell at their Feet and worship’d them:
In the Night they lock’d them up in a Cage, secur’d with Iron Bars, and
at the appointed time flay’d them alive.

[Sidenote: Towns and Villages.]

The chief Towns now remaining, and inhabited by the _Spaniards_, are 1.
_St. Lewis de Tampice_, a Colony of _Spaniards_ situate on the Northern
Bank of the River _Panuco_, at the very Mouth of it; where it hath a
very large Haven, but so barr’d with Sands, that no Ship of any great
Burden can enter or abide in it with safety; and yet the River otherwise
so deep, that Vessels of five hundred Tun, might Sail up threescore
Leagues at least within Land, and thereby visit the rich Mynes of
_Zatatecas_ on the one side of it, and of _New Biscay_ on the other, at
pleasure, and without fear of much opposition.

2. _St. Stevan del Puerto_, on the South side of the same River, eight
Leagues distant from the Sea, or Gulf of _Mexico_, at present the
Metropolis or chief Town of the Province, built by _Cortesius_ in the
place where stood old _Panuco_, which was likewise the Metropolis, or
Head Town of the Natives, before the _Spaniards_ burnt and destroy’d it.

3. _St. Jago de las Valles_, which is a Fronteer Place, and enjoyeth
certain special Immunities, and some fair Possessions also for defence
of the Countrey against the Salvages. It is twenty five Leagues distant
from _St. Stevan del Puerto_, lying in an open or Champain Countrey, and
is fenc’d about with a Wall of Earth.

[Sidenote: _Miles Philips_ his Voyage.]

_Miles Philips_, an _Englishman_, put ashore by Captain _John Hawkins_,
in the Bay of _New Spain_, _Anno 1568._, suffer’d great hardship before
he came to _Panuco_, from whence returning, he made mention of a City
lying along a River of the same denomination, (which is there not above
two Bowe shoots-broad,) in a pleasant Countrey, containing two hundred
_Spanish_ Families, beside the antient Inhabitants and _Negro_’s, which
all drive a great Trade in Salt, which is made in Pans Westward from the
River: _Philips_ travelling from _Panuco_ to _Mexico_, saw by the way
the Villages _Nohete_, by the _Spaniards_ call’d _Santa Maria_, and a
Cloyster of white _Monks_: Next he view’d _Mestitlan_, where some grey
_Monks_ had a House, and the Town _Puchuen_.

[Sidenote: _Chilton_’s Journal.]

Another account of this Province is taken from a Journal kept by _John
Chilton_, four years after _Philips_’s Voyage; he having a _Spaniard_
for his Convoy, left _Mexico_ to find out _Panuco_; in three days time
they reach’d the City _Mestitlan_, where he observ’d, that twelve
_Spanish_ Families liv’d amongst thirty thousand _Indians_. The City
built on a high Mountain, full of Woods, is surrounded with Villages,
through which run many brave Springs; and the Air about them is no less
wholsom than the Ground fruitful; the High-ways are shaded with all
sorts of Fruit-Trees.

The Village _Clanchinoltepec_, four times more Populous than
_Mestitlan_, belongs to a _Spanish_ Nobleman, who built a Cloyster there
for nine _Augustin_ Monks, of which Order there also reside twelve in
the City _Guaxutla_.

Moreover, they travel’d over the plain Countrey _Guastecan_, to the
Village _Tancuylabo_, inhabited by a tall People, with blue Painted
Bodies, and Pleited Hair, hanging down to their Knees, going stark
naked, but never without a Bowe and Arrow. They esteem nothing more than
Salt, as being the onely Cure against certain Worms that grow between
their Lips. From hence they travel’d to _Tampice_, in which Journey they
spent nine days; and coming thither, were inform’d, that of forty
_Christians_ which dwelt in the same, the _Indians_ had slain twelve,
whilst they were gathering of Salt. From hence they came to _Panuco_,
then in a manner deserted, because of the _Indians_ oppressing the
_Spaniards_, of which, at that time, there were but ten, and one Priest.
_Chilton_ falling sick here, resolv’d nevertheless to change that
unwholsom Air and barren place for a better; to which purpose, getting a
Horse, he took an _Indian_ behind him for his Guide, but loosing his way
in a thick Wood, happen’d amongst a Company of wild People, which dwelt
in Straw Huts, twenty of them immediately surrounding him, brought him
some clear sweet Water to drink, out of a Gilt _Venice_ Glass, which
having drunk, two naked Men led him into the high-way; which ended at
the Gate of the Wall’d City _Santo Jago de las Valles_, inhabited by
twenty five _Spanish_ Families, who inform’d _Chilton_ of the great
danger which he had been in, for the People which gave him the Water
were Man-eaters, who not long since, had burnt an _Augustine_ Cloyster,
built on a Mountain, had taken away, and eat the People, of which they
had in all likelyhood gotten the _Venice_ Glass; and had they not
observ’d _Chilton_ to be sickly, he had without doubt been eaten by
them, and his Skin, with some of his Hair, (that being a great Ornament
amongst them) been hung about their middle.

During _Chilton_’s stay in _St. Jago_, _Frans de Page_ came thither with
forty Soldiers from the Vice-Roy _Henry Manriques_, and took five
hundred _Indians_, good Bowe Men out of the Neighboring Villages,
_Tanehipa_ and _Tameclipa_, with which he design’d to go to the Silver
Mines at _Zacatecas_: _Chilton_ joyning with this Company, came to the
great River _De las Palmas_, which separates _New Spain_ from _Florida_,
where they spent three days in vain, seeking to find a passage over;
wherefore they at last took pieces of Timber, which joyning together,
and standing upon, they were Tow’d over by Swimming _Indians_; being
gotten on the other side, they March’d over steep Mountains, and thick
Wildernesses, and came at last to _Zacatecas_, on whose Silver Mines,
the richest in all _America_, work’d above three hundred _Spaniards_
daily.


                               SECT. VI.
                                Tabasco.

[Sidenote: Bounds and Description of _Tabasco_.]

The last Countrey belonging to _New Spain_ is _Tabasco_, bounded on the
North by the Northern Ocean, and on the East with _Jucatan_; and however
some account it a distinct Province, yet others make no mention of it,
letting it pass for that part of _Jucatan_ which lies about the City
_Tabasco_, from which it seems to be denominated: The Ground level and
without Mountains, hath many great Woods of Cedar-Trees, _Brasile_, and
others. Here are also many good _Indian_ Fruits, as the _Manmeyes_,
_Zapotes_, _Aguacates_, and _Guajabos_. For three Moneths they have
continually dry Weather, the rest of the year being for the most part
rainy; which vicissitude of Moisture and Heat makes the Countrey
exceeding fruitful, insomuch that they have three or four Harvests of
_Maiz_ in a year.

Vines, Figs, Lemmons, Oranges, Rice, Barley, and all sorts of
Garden-Herbs grow here also in great plenty.

The Pools, Brooks and Lakes, abound likewise with all manner of Fish:
and for Sea-Fish, besides the _Tortugas_, and _Yguanras_, the _Manate_,
or _Sea-Cow_, is of principal note.

[Sidenote: The Fish _Manate_.]

This Fish is terrible to behold, having a Head like an Ox, little Eyes,
two Feet near the Head in stead of Fins, two round Holes in stead of
Ears, round bones like Balls in its Brains, a short Tail, and bristly
Skin: The Females have two Dugs, with which they suckle their Young.

[Sidenote: Birds.]

Peacocks, Pheasants, Parrots, Quales, Hens, Pigeons, with several sorts
of Birds altogether unknown to the _Europeans_, are here in great
abundance.

[Sidenote: Beasts.]

The Woods also abound with Tygers and Lyons, which do no little hurt to
the Inhabitants, Wild Hogs, Deer, and Rabbets, are likewise here in
great plenty; and Turtles of an exceeding bigness: Likewise Apes,
Polecats, and Squerrils, which do very much hurt to the Fruit-Trees,
especially the _Cacao_. The _Musticho_’s are a great annoyance to the
People, and disturb their rest at Night.

[Sidenote: Languages of the Natives.]

Since the _Spaniards_ have conquer’d _Tabasco_, they have forc’d the
Inhabitants to observe their Laws and Customs. They speak three sorts of
Languages, amongst which that most us’d, call’d _Chontal_, is copious of
Words. The second, _Zoques_, is spoken on the Mountains which divide
_Chiapa_ and _Tabasco_. The _Mexican_ Tongue was first brought thither
by the Garrisons which _Muteczuma_ plac’d there in the Forts _Zimatlan_
and _Xicalango_, and is the most spoken, in regard it hath not onely its
Accents, but is also of great use, partly because it is understood in
most places of _America_, and partly because the Priests have made Songs
in that Tongue, with which the _Tabascans_ are much delighted.

The chief City _Nostra Sennora de la Vittoria_, already mention’d in
_Jucatan_, was so call’d by _Ferdinand Cortesius_, from the great
Victory which he obtain’d over the Indians when he march’d first towards
_Mexico_.

Thus far of the Description of the several Parts and Divisions of _New
Spain_, differing in Customs and Languages, though most of them have
some affinity with the _Mexicans_, who by force of Arms had made a way
to the supream Empire. All of them acknowledge a Creator, but have no
Name to express the Word _God_. But besides the Creator of the World
they have made to themselves Gods of many other Creatures; amongst which
are the Sun, Moon, Stars, and the Manes of the Deceased, the care of
whose Burial they committed to the Priests, which was sometimes in the
Fields, sometimes in their Houses; others carried their dead Bodies to
the Mountains, some buried them in Temples; and as they either burnt or
buried the Body, so they buried or burnt their Clothes and Riches with
them, especially of Persons of Quality, whilst those that accompanied
the Corps sung a mournful Song; after which they Feasted. The Heirs of
Noble-men that had been at the Funeral put themselves all into Mourning.
A Person, after he is dead, is stretch’d out upon the Floor, where he
lies till all his Friends come to Present and Complement him, as if
living: But at the death of an eminent Person they not onely bring him
Presents, but proffer him his Slaves, Steward, Butlers, Dwarfs, and
Houshold Priest, (all which a Lord must keep) that they may serve him in
the other World. The Priests which perform’d the Funeral Ceremonies,
walk’d before the Corps with the Image of the Idol which the Deceased
had appropriated to himself, (for every Lord, according to the greatness
of his Quality, bore the Name and Apparel of some Idol or another;)
other Priests beat on Drums, play’d on Pipes and singing Dirges,
perfum’d the Way with Myrrh, whilest the Servants and Relations made a
doleful cry; a Herauld also carried the Coat of Arms and Trophies of the
Deceased, artificially painted on Cloth; at last they pyl’d sweet Wood
about the Corps, which being lighted, and the Body burnt to Ashes, a
Priest in a frightful Dress, Vizarded with a gaping Mouth, long Teeth,
and fiery Eyes, came on a sudden, and with a long Stick stirr’d the
Ashes about, and gathering it in an Urn, buried the same with the
fore-mention’d things.

[Illustration]

The Idols in _New Spain_ are represented in terrible Figures, to which
they Offer humane Sacrifices.

The Priests, divided into higher or lower Orders, acknowledge a supream
Head, which they call _Papas_. Each Idol had a peculiar sort of Priests:
Those that serv’d _Viztlipuzli_, obtain’d their Places by Inheritance;
but others were chose by the Commonalty, unless they had been bred
Priests from their Infancy.

[Sidenote: Cloysters dedicated to the ancient _Mexican_ Religion.]

The _Mexican_ Cloysters in the time of _Heathenism_ were generally built
in the chiefest Temples, in a great _Piazza_, or square Court, where for
the most part two Monastical Houses stood one against another, the one
inhabited by a Fraternity of Recluses, and the other by a Sisterhood;
which last being Maids of twelve or thirteen years of age, call’d _The
Penitential Daughters_, swept the Temple, prepar’d Meat for the Idols
and Priests, which was plentifully supply’d from the Alms and Offerings
that were daily brought in to the Priests, consisting of little Cakes
made like Hands and Feet, besides other strange Meats, which being set
before the Idols, was soon after taken away again, and eaten up by the
Priests: They were under a Governess, who employ’d them in making
Embroideries to adorn the Temple; and sometimes rose up with the Priests
at Mid-night, and play’d on Pipes, perfum’d the Temple, and scourg’d
themselves till the Blood ran down their Backs, besmearing their Faces
therewith, and leaving it on a whole year; then going into a large
Chamber, where a Cistern stood for that purpose, they wash’d it off
again; after which, if they committed the least uncleanness, they were
put to a most miserable Death; which was judg’d upon seeing a Rat run
through the Nuns Chamber, or a Batt flying by it, or finding any piece
of Cloth gnaw’n by a Mouse or Rat; for they suppose that the
fore-mention’d Creatures dare not come into a hallow’d place, unless
defil’d. In this recluse manner they were onely confin’d to live a year,
which being expir’d, they had free leave to Marry.

The House opposite to the Nuns in the same square place of the Temple,
was inhabited by Youths of eighteen and twenty years of age, whose Heads
were shaven like Monks, and pleited Tufts hung from the Crown down to
their Backs; they liv’d also mean and chaste, kept the Priests Clothes
and Perfuming-Vessels, carried Wood for Offerings, and kept always
burning Lamps before _Viztlipuztli_’s Altar. Amongst them were also Boys
of a less Age, whose Office was to gather Flowers and Herbs to strow the
Temple with, to sharpen the Priests Lances, which they Let themselves
Blood with every Night in the Legs, and carry them Water. These Youths,
Cloth’d in Nets, fell on their Faces on the Ground when they met with a
Woman, and went four and four, or six and six together to beg Alms, and
by turns watch’d the fore-mention’d Fire; in the Morning they drew Blood
out of their Thighs, with which they anointed their Temples down to
their Ears, and when the Blood look’d black, wash’d it off again in a
consecrated Bath, which their strict and severe Life endur’d a whole
Year.

[Sidenote: _Mexican_ Religion abhorr’d by the neighboring People.]

The particular Religion of the _Mexicans_, compos’d of cruel slaughters
and butcheries of Men, reign’d a long time against the minds of the
other _Indians_ that were under their Dominion, every one beginning more
to abhor the cruel flaying of living People, and tearing out the Hearts
of Men for Offerings; and the rather, because they were forc’d to fetch
them out of their Enemies Countrey with the hazard of their own Lives,
insomuch that they were ready long before to have embrac’d another
Doctrine, if any other Teacher had but appear’d amongst them; which was
the chief reason why they so easily receiv’d the _Roman_ Religion: for
when _Cortesius_ had conquer’d the City _Mexico_, the _Mechoacan_ Agents
entreated him to send them Teachers to prescribe them Laws, according to
which they might live, because their Idolatry, which had long oppress’d
them, was not to be suffer’d any longer, because of the Cruelties which
were requir’d of them in the performance thereof.

[Sidenote: Their Processions.]

Their Processions were stately, and after this manner: The chiefest Nuns
raising a Paste of _Bledoi_-Seed and parched _Maiz_, kneaded it with
Honey, of which they made an Idol resembling their Deity _Viztipuztli_,
across whose Nose and Forehead they drew a blue Stroke; his Head they
adorn’d with a Plume of Feathers, and in the left Hand plac’d a round
Box, in the right a crooked Staff like a Serpent, and Wings behind on
his Shoulders; at the appointed Feast-day the Nuns meet before
Sun-rising, in new white Apparel, with Garlands of _Maiz_ about their
Heads and Necks, which hung down below the left Shoulder, their Faces
painted with several colours, about their Arms hung Parrots Feathers
from their Elbows down to their Hands: Thus adorn’d, they carried the
kneaded Idol to a Court, where the Youths that inhabited a Cloyster in
the same Temple, fetching the Idols blue Throne, with great Reverence
set it down at the lower Step of the Temple, at which the People threw
Dust on their Heads; which was no sooner done, but the Boys ran with all
speed to the Mountain _Chapultepec_, a League from _Mexico_, whither the
Multitude following them in manner of Procession, made all short Prayers
and Offerings there; from thence hastening into the Champain Fields
_Atlacuavaya_, they perform’d the like Service as before; which done,
they went to the Village _Cuyoacan_, a League farther; from whence they
came back in all haste with their Idol into _Mexico_: Wherefore this
Processioning for its expedition was call’d _Ipaina Viztliputli_. The
Idol being brought into the Temple, was by four Cords made fast to his
Throne, hoised up to the Cieling with the noise of Drums and Trumpets,
whilst the fore-mention’d Youths strow’d the Temple both within and
without full of Roses; after which the Nuns gave the Boys the
resemblances of Bones made of the same Dough with the Idol, with which
they were to cover the Floor of the Chappel; then appear’d the
Temple-Priests, with Scarfs about their Bodies, Garlands on their Heads,
and Strings with Flowers about their Necks, each going in order
according to his quality to the place where the Bones lay; which being
Consecrated with Songs and Dances, were religiously worshipp’d for Bones
of the Idol; after which six of the Priests went down to the Stone
_Quauxicalli_, on which the Prisoners lying upon their Backs, had their
Hearts pull’d out; which being finish’d, the Maids and Boys
before-mention’d went to meet one another, Dancing to the sound of
Pipes, Drums and Songs; which their nearest Relations answering, Danc’d
round about them, whither the whole City and Countrey People all about
came flocking in great numbers.

During this high Feast none, upon great Penalties, durst eat any other
Food but the Cakes made of the same Dough of which the Idol was made;
neither were they permitted, though Children, to drink till the
Afternoon.

Lastly, the Priest climb’d up to a Chappel strow’d with Roses, in which
the Idol sitting, they disrob’d him, broke his holy Arms and Legs into
little pieces, which they distributed amongst the common People, who
receiv’d them with great Reverence, and with tears in their Eyes,
imagining they eat the Body of their God; for which honour every one
paid a tenth part of the Charge which had been spent in this high Feast.
Then a Priest admonish’d them how they should lead their Lives, since
they were united with their God; which ended, they all went to their
several Habitations in a wonderful good order from the Temple.

[Sidenote: Ancient Attire of the _Mexicans_.]

Concerning the _Mexicans_ Apparel, it is a sufficient testimony, that
they are no way of the same original with the several barbarous Nations,
that run up and down naked in _New Spain_: for the Inhabitants of
_Mexico_ went antiently Cloth’d in Cotton: On their Heads they wore a
high Plume of red Feathers; about their Necks, over their Shoulders,
Breast and Back, a kind of large _Thorax_ of Feathers curiously pleited;
each Arm adorn’d with Armlets, and their Middles girt with broad white
Girdles full of red Streaks; in stead of Garters they wore Laces of
Feathers, as also a little above their Ancles. Their Priests besmear’d
all their Bodies, especially the Head, with an Ointment, whose special
vertue was to make their Hair grow exceeding long, which they braided
with broad Cotton Strings; they also smutch’d themselves with a kind of
blacking Stuff; when they went to make Offerings to their Idol in Caves,
Woods, or on high Mountains, they bedawb’d themselves with an Ointment
made of Spiders, Salamanders, Adders, Scorpions and Toads, which the
Temple-Boys caught for them in great abundance. This Ointment they made
with many Circumstances; for having roasted the fore-mention’d Vermine
on the Hearth of the perpetual Fire before _Viztlipuztli_’s Altar, and
stamp’d the same in a Mortar with Tobacco, living Scorpions, the Seed
_Ololuchqui_, (to which they ascrib’d a power of representing Visions)
hairy Worms, and Soot, they kneaded all together, put the Ointment in
Pots, and plac’d it before the Idol, thenceforth reputing it a
sanctifi’d Medicine, that would prove good against all manner of
Diseases; wherefore the Priests being always sent for to the Sick in
stead of Doctors, perfum’d the Patient, shav’d his Hair, hung Snakes
Bones about his Neck, and order’d him at a certain Hour to bathe
himself, and in the Night to watch before a Fire-hearth, and to eat no
Bread but what had been Offer’d to their Idol. Moreover, the said
Ointment is thought to have another power, _viz._ to make those that
anointed themselves with the same, valiant and strong; which the common
People believ’d, because the Priests would go through Woods and
Wildernesses that abounded with ravenous Beasts.

[Illustration]

These _Heathens_ also seem’d to have something of Circumcision and
Baptism; for they not onely cut off a piece of the Infant’s Ears and
privy Members, which they Offer’d to their Idols, but also wash’d them
as soon as they came into the World, putting into their Hands such Tools
as were of use in their Fathers Profession.

[Sidenote: Their Nuptial Solemnities.]

Their Marriages also were celebrated with great solemnity: The Priest
having ask’d the Bride and Bridegroom, If they would joyn together in
Matrimony? if they both consented, he ty’d the Brides Scarf, and
Bridegrooms Coat together, and so accompanying them home, led them nine
times about the Fire-hearth: If the Bride had no Impediments, then the
Bridegroom made Presents to her Father and Mother, Offerings to the
Gods, and a brave Dinner to the nearest Relations; after which an
Inventory was drawn of what each of them had brought, that upon their
being Divorc’d, (which was very common amongst the _Mexicans_) each
might have his share; and if they had Children, the Man was to keep the
Sons, and the Woman the Daughters; nor were they permitted, on pain of
death, being once parted, to joyn together again.

[Sidenote: The Feast _Texcoalt_.]

On the ninteenth of May they kept the Feast _Texcoalt_, Consecrated to
the Idol _Tezcatlipuca_, before whom they Offer’d a Slave, which was
done after this manner: Towards the Evening the Multitude coming into
the Temple, the Priests pulling off the Idols old, put on new Apparel,
hung him full of Precious Stones and Armlets, set Plumes of Feathers on
his Head; which done, the Curtains behind which he stood, were drawn,
and a Priest Cloth’d exactly like the Idol coming forth, turn’d himself
round, blow’d a kind of Trumpet towards the four Winds, and ate Earth,
which all the People imitated: whereof those which had committed any
hainous Offence, Offer’d Incense to the Idol, and weeping, begg’d
forgiveness of their Sins. Those that were Soldiers besought him to
grant them store of Prisoners, and strength to conquer their Enemies;
for which they would return him thanks with Offer’d Prisoners.

This Feast of _Texcoalt_ lasting ten days, ended on the twenty ninth of
_May_ with peculiar Ceremonies; for in the Morning a company of Priests,
black all over, carried on their Shoulders a large Chair of State richly
adorn’d; in which sat their Idol _Tezcatlipuca_, and Priests with long
pleited Hair, and Clad in the same Apparel with the Idol, which they set
down at the Foot of a pair of Stairs which led up to a Chappel; whither
the attendant Youths and Virgins came and spread Carpets before it, and
green Boughs of _Manghey_; after which two Priests carried the Idol into
a spacious Court in the Temple, several others walking before, each with
a perfuming Vessel; when they threw their Perfumes on the Consecrated
Hearth, they held their Hands towards the Idol, desiring him that he
would send their Prayers to Heaven: Next follow’d the Multitude, who
scourg’d themselves till the Blood ran down from their Backs. So soon as
the Procession was ended, the represented _Tezcatlipuca_ was hoised up
to the Cieling, and abundance of Flowers strow’d before the Altar; which
done, every one went home to Dinner, whilst the Youths and Virgins
adorn’d the Idol, and plac’d Meat before him: Lastly, the Votaresses
came two and two with Baskets of Bread, and Dishes of Meat: their
Governess in a white Sur-Coat over a red Vest, with Wings on her
Shoulders, and broad Girts, at which hung _Calabashes_ fill’d with holy
Reliques and Flowers: Moreover, she conducted the Votaresses to the
Steps of the Altar on which the Idol sat; where having eaten Bread they
came back, and the Temple-Servants went in their places, and carried the
Meat which stood on the Altar to the Priests Cells, who by that time
were to have Fasted five days: this done, the People came all to the
Temple again, to be present at the end of the Feast: then a Slave, who
had represented the Idol a whole year, appear’d, to whom everyone having
shew’d Reverence, the chief Priest cutting open his Breast, tore the
Slave’s Heart reaking out of his Body, and shew’d it to the Sun; then
the Consecrated Youths and Maids made a great noise with Drumming,
Singing and Dancing about the Body till Sun-set; after which the Virgins
going up to the upper Chappel, plac’d Bread and Fruit, made up like dead
Mens Bones and Heads, before the Idol, where, after it had stood a
little while, the Servants went up and fetch’d it down, whilst the
Youths and Maids went to their several Cloysters.

Much after the same manner, and with such like brutish Ceremonies, not
worth mentioning, was also celebrated the Feast of _Quetzatcoalt_.

In the inner part of the Temple stood a Stage, on which upon Festival
Days the People Acted Drolls; in which they sometimes feign’d themselves
deaf, blind, lame, and the like, and begg’d to be cur’d of their Idols;
sometimes were dress’d like Serpents, Adders, Crocodiles, or other
ravenous Beasts, in which postures they fought one with another.

[Sidenote: Computation of Time amongst the _Mexicans_.]

Those Feasts were all kept on certain times, according to the Mexican
Almanack, in which the Year was divided into eight Moneths, and each
Moneth into forty five Days, which together made three hundred and
sixty: The five remaining Days, to compleat the Year, they kept apart,
on which all Affairs whatsoever were laid aside, as Selling, Buying,
Offerings, _&c._ nothing else being thought on but Feasting one another
for the passing away of the time. The first Day of their Year was on the
twenty sixth of _February_. Each Moneth had a peculiar Name and Sign.
Moreover, they divided the Year into four parts by as many
Representations, _viz._ a House, a Rabbet, a Cane, and a Flint to strike
Fire with; and Figur’d it out by a Wheel with four Spikes jutting out
round about it, colour’d green, red, blue, and yellow, and in the middle
thereof a Sun; each Spike signifi’d thirteen years, wherefore it had
thirteen Divisions, distinguish’d by the four fore-mention’d
Representations: At each Division of the Wheel they set down what
remarkable things should happen that year by certain Characters; as, a
Man in red Apparel typifi’d that Year when _Ferdinand Cortesius_, clad
in Red, conquer’d _Mexico_. When the Wheel was fill’d with fifty two
years Prognostication, then on the last Night they broke all their Pots
and Vessels in pieces, and blew out their Candles, because they
believ’d, that at the end of the said fifty two years the World would be
at an end, and therefore they had no need of Housholdstuff, or ought
else: But so soon as the Day appear’d again, they play’d on Pipes,
Trumpets, and Drums, rejoycing that God had deferr’d the destruction of
the World fifty two years longer; then they bought new Utensils and
Candles, and made solemn Processions.

[Sidenote: Art of Writing.]

Concerning the Art of Writing amongst the Inhabitants of _New Spain_,
_Joseph Acosta_ tells us, That some old Books, containing ancient
Passages, the Course of the Heavens, nature of Beasts and Plants, were
found in _Jucatan_, according to the Relation of a Learned _Indian_, but
were all burnt by Command of a _Spanish_ Bishop, because he suppos’d
them to be full of Matter touching the Black Art. Their Histories they
describ’d with the Representations of the Things. Rhetorick and Poetry
the Children were taught by Rote in the Schools, so that they never
forgot what they had once learnt; But at present they use _Spanish_
Letters or Characters.

[Sidenote: Ancient Government.]

Moreover, the Government of _Mexico_ hath ever been kept in a good
Order, the King’s Power being exactly limited, that nothing might be
lost of the common Priviledges. The fourth King _Icoath_ made Earls, who
next to the Lords of _Tezcuco_ and _Tacuba_, had right to the Crown;
which was like a Mitre turn’d up behind, and rising before with a Point.
According as they increas’d in Power, so they advanc’d in Royal Dignity;
in which _Muteczuma_ the Second exceeded all others: And to manifest his
splendor, his House for all sorts of Creatures, and many other things,
might serve for a sufficient testimony: for in it he kept Sea-Fish in
salt Water, River-Fish in fresh Water, and all manner of Beasts in
peculiar places: The Birds were kept in great Aviaries, surrounded with
golden Rails. Next to the Kings follow’d four Earls call’d
_Atlacohecalcatl_, which signifies _Princes of the Throne Launces_, a
Weapon much us’d amongst the _Mexicans_. The next in Degree were the
_Tlacatecatl_, or _Man-cleavers_; _Esauahuacatl_, or _Blood-shedders_;
_Tsallancalqui_, or _Lords of Blackness_, without all which the King
durst not take any Business in hand. High and lesser Courts of
Judicatory, where Matters of Life and Death were try’d, were in most
Cities; and other Courts also for petty Quarrels, Controversies, and the
like. The Collectors brought their Revenues to the Court every Moneth.
The chief thing which preferr’d both Rich and Poor to Places of Honor,
consisted in Valour and heroick Exploits. Their Arms were chiefly sharp
pieces of Flint made fast to a Stick, with which they could at one Blow
chop off a Horses Head. They also us’d Pikes, Clubs, and Lances, and
sometimes Slings: For defensive Armour, they had Helmets and Shields,
made of Tygers, Leopards, and Lyons Skins. They always fell upon their
Enemies unawares, their Design being generally to take Prisoners rather
than to kill them; for they reserv’d them for Offerings to their Idols.
_Muteczuma_ made several Commanders over his Armies, giving them a Power
one above the other, which were to be distinguish’d by several Marks;
for the chiefest ty’d the Hair on the top of their Heads with a red
String, betwixt which stuck a brave Plume of Feathers; at the end
whereof hung as many Tassels as they had done noble Exploits. To this
Order belong’d also the King, who wore one of the same Marks, with which
King _Muteczuma_ and his Son stand Carv’d on a Rock. The _Ayulas_, or
_The Order of the Eagle_, consisted of valiant Men. The _Grey Knights_
were of less Quality, and wore Collars which reach’d up to their Ears,
the lower part of their Body being naked. Persons of greater Dignity,
when going to the War, were Arm’d from Head to Foot: Which Order was
also permitted to wear Cotton-Clothes, and Shoes richly embroider’d with
Gold and Silver; they us’d painted Vessels, and had Lodgings provided
for them at Court.

[Sidenote: Their Education of Youth.]

Moreover, it is worthy of observation, what great care the _Mexicans_
took in the bringing up of their Children; to which purpose they had
Schools near to their Temples, in which Youth was taught to Sing, Dance,
Morality, Obedience, and also Martial Discipline. Children of noble
Extract had Learned Men for their Tutors. Their Punishments for
Transgressions were very severe, the Masters forcing their Scholars to
Fast and Watch, carry great Burthens of Provisions to the Army, and be
in the midst of Engagements. Others, whose Fancy led them to a holy
Life, willingly embrac’d the Services of the Temple.

[Sidenote: Their manner of Dancing.]

Their manner of Dancing in _New Spain_ was very strange and differing;
they us’d pretty Instruments, and Songs which contain’d antique
Passages, according to the Times; they in their Motions imitated
Shepherds, Fisher-men, Plowmen, Hunters, and the like: Sometimes they
Danc’d in _Mascarades_, with a Man on their Shoulders, making the same
Motion with his Hands in the Air, as the other with his Feet on the
Ground. They had also Tumblers and Dancers on the Ropes, which shew’d
strange Tricks on an erected Pole. But above all Dances, the _Mitotes_
was the chief, which was generally Danc’d in the King’s Palace, or inner
Court of the Temple; in the middle of which they plac’d a great Drum and
a hollow Tub on a large Image; round about which the most eminent
Persons made a Ring, Sang sweetly, and Danc’d leisurely, when on a
sudden two that are more nimble, with divers Motions came into the midst
of them, and Danc’d exactly after the sound of the Drum and hollow Tub,
which was seconded with the noise of Flutes and Pipes.

                             New Gallicia.


[Sidenote: Bounds and Extent of _New Gallicia_.]

_New Gallicia_, by some call’d _Guadalajara_, from the chief City. This
whole Province is the most Northern Countrey of all _America_, that is
inhabited to any purpose by the _Spaniards_. Here, ’tis true, they are
scatter’d up and down in all the parts of it, but it is at a huge
distance, and for the most part onely where the Mines are. It is bounded
on the East and to the South, with the Kingdom of _Mexico_ or _New
Spain_; on the West, with the Gulf or Bay of _California_; Northward,
for so much as is yet discover’d, with _Quivira_ and _Cibola_, lying
between eighteen and twenty eight Degrees of Northern Latitude, that is,
from _La Natividad_, a Port so nam’d by the _Spaniards_, in the Confines
of _New Spain_, to the most Northerly Borders of _Cinoloa_, a part of
this Province, containing, as is suppos’d, not much less than three
hundred Leagues in length, and in breadth much more; and whereof not a
tenth part is either us’d or frequented by the _Spaniards_.

[Sidenote: Temperature and Nature of the Countrey.]

The Air is generally here very temperate, inclining rather to Heat than
Cold, and subject now and then to sudden Storms of Rain, and great Claps
of Thunder, which yet do not hinder, but that the Countrey is held to be
reasonably healthful, and the People observ’d to live generally to a
good old Age. The Soil, by reason of the Climate, would be a little
inclining to Drought, but that, besides the frequent Rains which it
hath, it is constantly moistned with fresh Morning Dews, which make it
for the most part wonderfully fruitful, almost beyond belief, yielding
for every Bushel of Wheat that is sown, threescore; and of _Maiz_, two
hundred for one; besides great plenty of Sugar-Canes and Cochinele; both
which nevertheless the _Spaniards_ are said to neglect in some sort,
employing themselves wholly about richer Commodities: for the Countrey
affords them good store of Mines of Silver and Brass, but of Gold or
Iron, not many as yet have been found. The Rivers abound plentifully
with Fish, and the Woods with Venison, and some other wild Beasts. The
Countrey is generally more mountainous than plain, frequently shaded
with Woods, and whole Forrests of the stateliest Pine-Trees and Oaks
that are to be seen; amongst which breed abundance of Wolves, which do
great mischief to the People, as also Scorpions and _Mustiecho_’s. The
Hurts receiv’d from Scorpions, are heal’d with the Juice of the Fruit
call’d _Queon_; those from the _Mustiecho_’s, by Vinegar and the Juice
of Lemmon. Here is likewise a green Stone, accounted a soveraign
Medicine against the Gravel.

[Sidenote: Several sorts of _Tunas_-Trees.]

The Trees peculiar to this Countrey, are, the _Tunas_, already spoken of
in _Guatimala_, and thought to be the same we vulgarly call _Indian
Fig-Trees_, and are distinguish’d into six sorts.

The first, by the _Portuguese_ call’d _Cardon_, hath sharp Prickles,
thick Leaves, full of slimy Juice, an odoriferous Flower, oval Fruit,
cover’d with an Orange-colour’d Rind, and small Roots: The Fruit within
consists of a white juicy, and well tasted Pulp, full of black Seed.

The second hath a round Body full of Boughs, with Star-like Prickles
hanging downwards, the Flower white, and the Fruit very like that of the
_Cardon_, onely smaller.

[Illustration]

The third is the _Caxabra_, which shoots up to a great Tree full of
prickly Cods; at the utmost end grows a large white Flower; the Fruit,
which is as big again as an Egg, is pleasant and cooling.

The fourth sort hath a straight Body full of Prickles, runs lesser and
lesser to the top; at the end of the small Boughs, each thick Leaf
produces another; the Wood, if kindled, burns like a Candle.

The fifth, nam’d _Cumbeba_, grows out of small Roots, with three or four
corner’d thick Leaves, full of Prickles, the Flower somewhat less than
the former, the Fruit oval, hard and red, having a white and juicy Pulp:
The Prickles of this _Cumbeba_-Tree are so sharp, and stick in so deep,
that they can scarce be pull’d out. This is that sort of _Tunas_ that
produces _Cochinele_, which is a Worm that grows under the Leaves, and
is cover’d with a Skin, which being neatly taken off and dry’d in the
Sun, as formerly mention’d, becomes a rich Commodity. _Joseph de Acosta_
tells us, that the _Spanish_ Fleet, _Anno 1578._ carried so much
_Cochinele_ to _Spain_, as amounted to two hundred eighty three thousand
seven hundred and fifty Ryals.

But the last sort of the _Tunas_ is the _Unirumbeba_, which hath a
straight Body full of Prickles, on the top whereof grow divers prickly
Leaves, not unlike those of the Palm-Tree: It is onely found in barren
places, remote from the Sea.

Moreover, all kind of Fruits transplanted hither from _Spain_ thrive
very well, as Apples, Pears, Granats, Figs, Peaches, Apricocks,
Muskmelons, _&c._

[Sidenote: The Root _Castanuela_.]

[Sidenote: The _Batata_.]

The Root _Castanuela_ affords a much better Feeding for Swine than
Acorns. But amongst many other Roots which are found here, as the
_Xiquimas_, _Taca_, _Cochuco_, _Cari_, _Totora_ and _Mani_, the chief is
the _Batata_, which is fat, sweet, and windy; it runs over the Ground
with a tough green Sprig, the new Fibres taking Root dispersedly up and
down, being yellow without, and within full of milky Juice; the Leaf
resembling a Heart, is of a pale yellow colour on the top, and douny
underneath; roasted in Ashes, it eats better than a Turnip: It is
divided into three sorts.

The first, call’d _Omenapo yeima_, when boyl’d, shews like red _Betel_,
but Dyes of a Skye-Colour; the innermost Skin, which is of a dark Red,
yields an Ink-like Juice.

The second sort, call’d _Parro_, differs little from the first, onely
the Body, Root, and Veins of the Leaves, are of a Purple colour.

The third sort _Jetiope_, being white, hath a very good rellish, and
cures the Ague.

The Pepper, which is here call’d _Axi_, grows in the warmest Valleys,
and the more by being often water’d: there are of it divers kinds,
differing in colour, smell, and taste one from the other; for one sort
is green, yellow, or red; another sort yields a strong musky scent; and
one sort is sharper, another milder: the Veins and Kernels thereof are
eaten with Salt.

The Herb _Cevadilla_ cures all manner of Sores.

[Sidenote: Beasts.]

This Countrey also breeds an innumerable company of Deer, Hogs, Goats,
Sheep, Oxen, and Horses; and of hurtful Creatures, Pismires, which do
great mischief to the Plants, and Locusts, which fall in huge swarms on
the Corn, and cannot be frighted from the same by any means whatsoever.
The want of Water is also no small prejudice to the Fields.

The biggest River, call’d _Guadalajara_, with many windings runs
North-westward into the Southern Ocean; and four Leagues from the City
of the same, falling down from a steep Rock, it makes such a horrible
noise, that it deafens those which approach the same.

The Lake _Mechoacan_ opens here also with a wide Mouth.

[Sidenote: Two sorts of Hedge-hogs.]

The River before mention’d, produces all manner of Fish in great
abundance; and also a sort of Hedge-hogs, call’d _Iguana_, which live
both in the Water, and on the Land, and are of two sorts: The first,
call’d _Senembi_, is four Foot long, of a deep green colour, with black
and white Spots, hath a scaly Skin, white Spots on each side of the
Head, a row of sharp Prickles from the Head to the Tail, wide Nostrils,
great black Eyes, and little Teeth. The second sort, call’d _Tejaguacu_,
differs from the first, in having white Spots on a brown Skin, a longer
Tail, and a red Tongue, which is slit. Both sorts are reported to fast
eight Moneths together; and though often terribly wounded, and dead to
all imagination, yet live a great while after; and though they swim up
and down in Rivers, yet they Lay their Eggs in the Sand: their Flesh
boyl’d is both wholsom, and of a good relish.

[Sidenote: The manner of the _Spaniards_ living.]

The _Spaniards_ which inhabit _New Gallicia_, drive a considerable Trade
in Merchandizing, Husbandry, breeding of Cattel, and working in the
Mines: They use Wayns and Carrs, drawn by Oxen, Mules, and Horses, to
carry their Loads, as also _Spanish_ Weights and Measures. They are
little troubled with any other Mischiefs but what may happen from the
treacherous Natives, who take all opportunities to run into the Woods,
that there they may exercise their _Pagan_ Religion in freedom; in which
having spent some time, they gather a considerable number together, and
oftentimes fall unawares on the _Spaniards_, who use Leather Shields and
Helmets, and furr’d Cotton Clothes, to secure them from the Arrows which
the _Indians_, lying in Ambuscades, shoot at them out of the Bushes.

[Sidenote: The Nature, Habits, and Customs of the Natives.]

The Natives, though subtile, are lazy, and will not work, unless for
great Rewards. They wear Cotton Shirts, square Cloaks of the same Stuff,
made fast with two Buttons on their Breasts; Drawers, and soal’d Shoes:
Flag-Matts serve them for Beds, on which they lie under Cotton Clothes:
About their Necks, Arms, and Legs, they wear green Stones, and Snale
Shells for an Ornament. Their greatest Recreation is Dancing, their
Musick being nothing else but the noise or sound of a piece of hollow
Wood. Horse-flesh, and Bread made of _Maiz_, is by them accounted a
great Dainty. The Drink _Cacao_ is also highly esteem’d amongst them;
but much more the Wine that they make of _Maquey_, which is the
wonderful Tree that affords many necessary things, _viz._ Syrrup, Honey,
Oyl, Vinegar, Yarn, Needles, Water, and Wine; every Man making it his
Business to plant and preserve the same with great care near his House,
notwithstanding they grow in several places of the Fields; they have
broad thick Leaves with sharp ends, out of which is drawn a Thorn, which
serves them for a Needle or Pin. These Leaves have a hairy Filament
about them, which serves in stead of Thred: the young Sprout being cut,
produces a sweet Juice, which boyl’d, makes good Wine; when grown sowre,
serves for Vinegar; but being twice boyl’d, becomes a Syrrup; and being
hung over the Fire a third time, a perfect Honey: Also the Wood being
spungie, keeps Fire as well as Match. Moreover, the Inhabitants when
they travel, carry Leather Bags with them full of _Cacao_, _Maiz_, and
Pepper, mix’d together.

Over each Village in this Countrey the _Spaniards_ have plac’d an
_Indian Casique_, _Alcalde_, and _Alguazil_, where all sorts of
Provisions are sold at a Set-price.

The _Casiques_ are succeeded by their Heirs, who resent nothing worse
than Affronts, and take pride in nothing more than their Valour.

The _Moors_ or _Negro_’s which are brought hither from _Guinee_, do all
manner of hard Labour.

The _Guachichiles_ and _Guamares_ area valiant People, and have each
their peculiar Language, utterly different from the _Mexican_.

[Sidenote: Division of _Nova Gallicia_.]

This Countrey comprehends these inferior Provinces: 1. _Guadalajara_; 2.
_Xalisco_; 3. _Chiametta_; 4. _Couliacan_; 5. _Cinoloa_; all of them on
the Western Shore. 6. _Zacatecas_, to which some add _Nova Biscaia_ and
_Nova Mexico_, though others treat of them as distinct Countreys apart
from the rest.


                               SECT. II.
                              Guadalajara.

[Sidenote: Bounds of _Guadalajara_.]

_Guadalajara_ is bounded on the West, with _Xalisco_; on the South and
South-West, with _New Spain_; and on the North, with _Zacatecas_. It is
a Countrey exceeding pleasant, and rich in all kind of Commodities, but
especially in its Mines of Silver. It is well water’d with the River
_Barania_, which runneth through the midst of it, and with divers other
Streams: yielding abundantly both Wheat, _Maiz_, and some other Grain.
In a word, there is nothing said of the properties of _New Gallicia_ in
general, either for Soil, Climate, or People, but is peculiarly verifi’d
of this Province.

[Sidenote: Towns and Cities.]

The chief Towns are 1. _Guadalajara_, which gives Name to the whole
Province. It is seated on the Banks of the River _Barania_, in a most
delectable and sweet Air, and a rich Soil, by advantage whereof it is
become the Metropolis of _New Gallicia_, honour’d with an Episcopal See,
which was translated thither from _Compostella_ in the Year 1570. with
the Courts of Judicature, and the Residence of the King’s Treasurers for
that Province. This City was built on the Plain _Molino_, by _Nunnez de
Guzman_, in the Year 1531. The neighboring Mountains afford store of
Timber. All manner of _Spanish_ Plants grow here likewise in great
plenty. In the City is a Cathedral, several Cloysters, inhabited by
_Augustine_ and _Franciscan_ Monks. The Bishop of this City belongs to
the Arch-bishop of _Mexico_. The Air very temperate, neither molesting
the Inhabitants with too great Cold, nor excess of Heat.

2. _St. Maria de los Lagos_, a Town thirty Leagues Eastward of
_Guadalajara_, being a Fronteer Place, and built on purpose to secure
the Countrey against the _Chichemecæ_, which are a barbarous and
unreduc’d People of the North-East parts of this Countrey who harbouring
themselves in Caves under Ground in the thickest huge Woods and
Forrests, do oftentimes issue out, and make foul spoil in the Countrey
where they come, having first intoxicated themselves with a Liquor made
of certain Roots, and would do much more harm, if it were not for this
Garrison.

3. _Del Spiritu Santo_, built by the Founder of the other two, _viz._
_Nunnez de Gusman_ aforesaid, in a part of the Countrey which they call
_Tepeque_.


                               SECT. III.
                                Xalisco.

[Sidenote: Bounds and Description of _Xalisco_.]

_Xalisco_, or _Galesco_, as some call it, is bounded on the North, with
_Couliacan_; on the South, with some parts of _New Spain_; on the East,
with the Province of _Guadalajara_; and on the West, with the Gulf or
Bay of _California_.

The Countrey is chiefly fertile in _Maiz_ and Mines of Silver, not
altogether so apt for Herbage and Pasture as some other Countreys about
it. The People were Cannibals before the _Spaniards_ came amongst them,
eating Man’s-flesh; were much given to quarrelling and Contentions
amongst themselves, but by this time, ’tis suppos’d they are reasonably
well reclaim’d both from the one and the other.

[Sidenote: Towns of chief note.]

In this Countrey, besides many other goodly Streams, is the great and
famous River _Barania_, on the Banks whereof are seated most of their
principal Towns, as 1. _Xalisco_, which gives Name to the whole
Province, and to a large Promontory or Foreland on the Western Coasts,
which shoots it self out into the Bay of _California_, right over
against certain Islands, which the _Spaniards_ call The _Three Maries_.
This was an ancient City or Town of the Natives, but sack’d and taken by
_Nunnez de Gusman_, in the Year 1530.

2. _Compostella_, built by the aforesaid _Gusman_, and so nam’d from the
City in _Spain_, so famous for the Grave of _James_ the Apostle, who
(according to the _Roman_ Writers) was buried there, lies near the South
Sea on a barren Soil, within the _Torrid Zone_; yet the Ground breeds
many sorts of Vermine, besides other noxious Creatures; amongst which
the _Capybara_ roots up whole Trees and other Plants in the Night. This
Beast, resembling an indifferent large Hog, hath short Legs and Claws,
thick Head, with a Beard, wide Ears, and on each Jaw-bone twenty four
Teeth, besides two Tusks, but no Tail; it goes slow, but swims exceeding
fast, and dives under Water for a considerable time together; they often
feed together in great Herds, and make a terrible noise.

3. _La Purification_, a small Town on the Sea side, towards the Confines
of _New Spain_.


                               SECT. IV.
                               Chiametla.

[Sidenote: Situation of _Chiametla_.]

Against _Xalisco_ juts _Chiametla_, along the South Sea, where the
Inhabitants wear short cloaks, and Deer-skin Shoes; and in the Wars use
Shields made of strong Twigs twisted together. The Women, which are
indifferent handsom, are clad down to their Feet.

[Sidenote: Towns of principal note.]

The chief Town of this Province is _Sant Sebastian_, call’d from the
River upon which it stands; it was built by Captain _Franciscus de
Yvarra_, _Anno 1554._ who discovering many Silver Mines, hath made
several Melting-houses, in which the Silver being melted swims upon the
Lead.


                                SECT. V.
                               Couliacan.

[Sidenote: Bounds of _Couliacan_.]

Next to _Chiametla_, Westward and Southward of _Cinoloa_, lies
_Couliacan_, Coasting all along the Bay of _California_, which it hath
on the West; on the East it hath _New Biscay_; and on the South,
_Xalisco_. The Countrey is not defective in any kind of necessary
Provision, but more especially it aboundeth with Fruits of all sorts.
But the _Spaniards_ look onely at the Mines, of which they have some few
in this Countrey. The People were generally Cloth’d with Cotton-Wooll
when the _Spaniards_ came first amongst them, but yet never a whit the
more modest, being exceedingly given to Venery, and that in a more
shameless and beastly manner than many other _Americans_ who went naked.

[Sidenote: Towns.]

The _Spanish_ Towns are these, 1. _Hiustula_, seated on the Banks of a
fair River, distant about a days Journey from the Sea. 2. _Quinola._ 3.
_Quatrobarrios_, an old Town of the Natives, but new nam’d by the
_Spaniards_. 4. _El Leon_, an old Burrough. 5. _Couliacan_, the chief
Town of the Province. 6. _St. Michael_, in the Valley of _Arroba_, two
Leagues distant from the Sea, in a rich and plentiful Countrey, both for
Corn and Fruit, whither it was remov’d from the Banks of the River
_Orala_, where it first stood; it was built by _Nunnez de Gusman_ in the
Year 1531. after he had burnt the Towns, and destroy’d a great number of
the Natives, Inhabitants of the Countrey.

[Sidenote: _Nunnez de Gusman_ first Discoverer of this Countrey.]

[Sidenote: Serpents worshipp’d by the Natives.]

This Countrey was first discover’d by the aforesaid _Nunnez de Gusman_
(after he had built _Guadalajara_) after this manner: Marching from
_Chiametla_ to _Piatzala_, he ruin’d this Province with Fire and Sword:
he likewise conquer’d the Countreys of _Zapuatun_ and _Piaztla_; the
first being a Plain, lay inclos’d within high Mountains, where the
_Spaniards_ met none but Women, till they came to a great River call’d
_De la Sall_, whose Banks on each side were well inhabited; the second
juts against the Ocean, and is water’d by a River of the same
Denomination. Here, within the Houses, (which are built after a strange
manner) lay thousands of Serpents mingled together, with their Heads
sticking out on the top and at the sides, and hissing with open Mouth at
those which approached them. The Inhabitants shew’d great Reverence to
these Serpents, because (as they said) the Devil often appear’d to them
in that form. And this seems to be a Custome amongst them from the
Tradition of _Eves_ being tempted by the Devil in the shape of a
Serpent: Nor was this Superstition peculiar onely to these _Indians_,
forasmuch as divers Nations of the ancient _Heathens_ of other parts of
the World, worshipp’d the Likeness of a Serpent. And even amongst the
_Greeks_, according to _Plutarch_, _Hesychius_, _Clemens Alexandrinus_,
and others, it was no unusual thing in their religious Worship to call
on _Eva_, and at the same time to shew a Serpent. _Plutarchus_ and
_Ælianus_ say, That the _Egyptians_ honour’d a Serpent for their God.
The same saith _Erasmus Stella_ of the old _Prussians_; _Sigismund
Baro_, of the _Liflanders_; and _Alexander Guaginus_, of the
_Sarmatians_ and _Samogethes_. Moreover, some write, that in the
Province of _Calecut_ are Serpents with exceeding great Heads, and
weighing as much as a great Hog, to which the King shews great
Reverence; so that it seems the Devil takes delight to be worship’d in
that shape wherein he work’d the Fall of Man-kind.

_Gusman_ leaving _Piaztla_ march’d to _Bayla_, where he found the great
River _De Mugeres_, and the Countrey full of Woods and Pastures: thence
travelling upwards along _Mugueres_, they ascended to the top of a
Mountain, where they were assaulted by the Inhabitants of the aforesaid
Village _Quinola_, whom nevertheless they soon put to flight; but not
long after receiv’d a shrew’d Repulse at the Entrance into a Wood built
full of Houses; yet nevertheless being at length Conquerors, though not
without sufficient loss, they march’d farther in amongst the Mountains,
till their Provisions beginning to grow scarce, and they seeing no
likelihood of getting to an end of this troublesom Journey, at last
their Necessities forc’d them to retire.

[Illustration]

[Sidenote: The Fish _Guarapucu_.]

[Sidenote: The _Piracarba_.]

[Sidenote: Flying Fishes.]

The Flood which comes out of the Sea up to the City _St. Michael_,
through the River _Cignatlan_, abounds with Fish, and especially the
_Guarapucu_, which is seven Foot long when it comes to its full growth;
it hath no Scales, but smooth Skin of a Silver colour mix’d with Green:
from the Head to the Tail runs a crooked Line of thin Scales on each
side; it swims exceeding swift, feeds on lesser Fishes, and spawns in
the Sea: the Flesh being wholsom and good to eat, is salted up against
Winter. At the same Place is also the _Piracarba_, which shines
exceedingly, having Silver-colour’d Scales, a broad slit Tail, a long
white Beard, four great Fins, and a little Head. Farther into the Sea
are a sort of flying Fish, call’d _Pirabebes_, which rise by thousands
up out of the Water, so escaping the _Dolphins_ and other Fish which
prey on them; yet sometimes they are snatch’d up by the Birds, or else
by the Fishes, when they dive down into the Water to wet their own
Wings, which consist of a thin Skin, distinguish’d in length by tough
Fins. These flying Fish also differ much one from another, for most of
them are like Herrings; others have a thick Head, round before like the
Dolphins.

Moreover, the Countrey about _St. Michael_ was always well inhabited.
The Houses, being artificially built, were adorn’d on the top with many
obscene Images, and venereal Representations: But since the _Spaniards_
have conquer’d this Countrey they have destroy’d them, and built other
Houses in their stead, and also bestow’d much cost and labour on the
Silver Mines _De las Virgines_.


                               SECT. VI.
                                Cinoloa.

[Sidenote: Bounds of _Cinoloa_.]

_Cinoloa_ is the most Northern part of _New Gallicia_, bounded on the
West, with some part of the Gulf or Bay of _California_; on the East,
with a long Ridge of Mountains, which they call _Tepecsuan_; on the
North, with _Cibola_; and with _Couliacan_ on the South. This Country,
besides the general fertility of the whole Province of _New Gallicia_,
yields great store of Cotton-Wool, by reason whereof both Men and Women
here are better Apparell’d, for the most part, than elsewhere the
_Americans_ are; is exceedingly well water’d with Rivers, which descend
from those Mountains _Tepecsuan_, not above thirty or forty Leagues
distant from the Sea; and which, with the variety of their Streams and
Meandrous glidings, do divide the Countrey into many and good Pastures,
which are likewise stor’d with abundance of Kine, Oxen, and other
Cattel.

[Sidenote: Towns.]

The chief Towns possess’d by the _Spaniards_ are 1. _St. Philip_ and
_Jacob_, seated towards the Sea side, on the Banks of a fair River,
about thirty or forty Leagues distant from the Town of _Couliacan_.

2. _St. John de Cinoloa_, an ancient Colony of _Spaniards_, setled there
by _Francisco de Yvarra_, in the Year 1554, which is all they have in
this Countrey, except some few old Forts of the Natives, which they
found, after their manner, poorly furnish’d; but have since repair’d
them for Defence against the Natives of those Parts, which as yet remain
unreduc’d.

[Sidenote: _Nunnez de Gusman_’s Travels.]

This Province was also discover’d by _Nunnez de Gusman_, who having
rested some Weeks in _St. Michael_, proceeding on his Way, he Ferried
over the River _Petatlan_, which receiv’d that Denomination because the
Houses were cover’d with Mats, by the _Indians_ call’d _Petat_.

The People hereabouts were generally Man-eaters.

Eighteen Leagues farther runs the River _Tamochala_, which hath many
Villages on both sides thereof.

Between _Petatlan_ and _Tamochala_ lie several desolate Wildernesses,
and Woods of the _Brasile_-Tree.

But _Gusman_ travelling up twenty seven Leagues along the fore-mention’d
River _Tamochala_, came to the Province _Cinoloa_, where they stay’d six
Weeks, by reason of the abundance of Rains; during which time the
Villagers provided them Turtle-Doves, Hares, Rabbets, and all sorts of
Fowls; but at last deserted their Habitations in the Night: after which
the _Spaniards_ crossing _Tamochala_ went along a barren Desart, where
(had they not found Water in certain Wells, and likewise store of Juice
out of the _Tunas_-Trees) they had without doubt perish’d; at last
getting over the River _Yaguinu_, they found a deserted Village, out of
which a broad Path led along the Stream; whither _Gusman_ marching, he
came into a Plain, where he spy’d several _Indians_, which after some
resistance were routed by the _Spanish_ Horse.

The Villages built on the Banks of the River _Yaguinu_, as also the
Language of the Inhabitants differ little from the former.

Not far from hence a Ridge of Hills runs into the Sea, and also extend
themselves a hundred Leagues towards _Xalisco_.

                               Zacatecas.

[Sidenote: Bounds and Description of _Zacatecas_.]

The _Zacatecas_, as they call them, are bounded on the South, with
_Guadalajara_; on the North, with _New Biscay_; on the West, with
_Couliacan_ and some part of _Xalisco_; and on the East, with _New
Spain_. The Countrey, especially the more Western part of it, is very
rich in Silver Mines, no Province of this part of _America_ richer; but
not so apt either for Wheat or _Maiz_. But the Eastern parts of it are
abundantly stor’d with all sorts of Fruits, the Woods every where
replenish’d with Deer, the Fields no less with Corn, and every Tree
almost giving Entertainment to some Bird or other.

[Sidenote: Towns and Villages.]

The Towns are 1. _Las Zacatecas_, forty Leagues distant from
_Guadalajara_, and fourscore from _Mexico_, but neighbor’d with most
rich Mines, and therefore both Garrison’d and well peopled by the
_Spaniards_; for ’tis suppos’d there are no less than five hundred
Families of them in the Town, and about the Mines.

2. _St. Martins_, twenty seven Leagues distant from _Zacatecas_, and as
rich a Place, having a Colony of four hundred _Spaniards_ at least.

3. _St. Lucas de Avinno._ 4. _Erena_, lesser Towns, but both of them
rich, and seated in the midst of excellent Mines.

5. _Nombre de Dios_, in the most Northerly part of this Countrey, sixty
eight Leagues distant from _Guadalajara_, and founded by the aforesaid
_Francisco de Yvarra_; who having subdu’d and quieted the Natives, and
thereby gain’d to himself the Government of these Countreys, granted the
propriety of some Silver Mines both to the _Spaniards_ and to the
Natives, and by that means drew so many of them thither, that in a short
time it became the chiefest and best peopled town of the whole Province.

6. _Durango_, in the Valley of _Guadiana_, eight Leagues distant from
_Nombre de Dios_, and built by _Yvarra_.

7. _Xeres de Frontera_, a Place built on purpose for the repressing of
the _Chichemecæ_ aforesaid, and other Salvages that infested the Borders
of _Guadalajara_, in the Regency of the Marquess of _Villa Manrique_.

8. Last, _St. Lewis_, built by _Alonso Pacheco_, in that part of the
Countrey which is call’d _Uxitipa_, and peopled by him with a Colony of
_Spaniards_, being distant about twenty Leagues from _Panuco_ in _New
Spain_, to which the whole Countrey of _Uxitipa_ once belong’d.

[Sidenote: Several Mines discover’d by the _Spaniards_.]

The aforesaid _Franciscus de Yvarra_, _Anno 1554._ discover’d the Mine
call’d _Sant Martin_, and since also _Lucas Avinno_, the Mine _Del
Sombrereto_, lying near the City _Del Erena_: but the Mines _De los
Ranchos_, _Chalchuites_, _De las Nieves_, and _Del Frisuillo_, would
produce much more Silver, if the Mine-works were stor’d with
Quicksilver. The Vice-Roy of _New Spain_, nam’d _Lodowick de Velasco_,
order’d a certain number of Soldiers, Slaves, Horses and Mules, for
every Mine, to defend the Workmen from the Assaults of the Natives,
which oftentimes Sallied out upon them. Moreover, _Velasco_ sent Priests
through all the Countrey to Preach the _Gospel_: But _Yvarra_ having the
care of the Priests, guarded them with a company of Soldiers, and in his
Way discover’d the Valley _San Juan_, and the River _De las Nacos_,
where he conquer’d the rebelling Natives.

Near the Silver Mine _Sant Martins_ the Monks built a Cloyster; after
which _Yvarra_ gave free leave to all that would, to dig in the Mine at
_Avinno_, which he had bought, on condition they should pay the real
fifth part of what they got, to the _Spanish King_: which Priviledge
stirr’d up many, insomuch that _Avinno_ in a short time grew very
populous. _Yvarra_, though having brought his Business to this pass,
could not rest, but sent _Antonius Pacheco_ to a Valley in _Guadiana_,
to build the foremention’d City _Durango_, where several Rivers make a
convenient and delightful place for Habitation, whither _Yvarra_
follow’d three Moneths after, and finish’d the new Town. But the
chiefest Silver Mines, which borrow their Denominations from the
Province _Zacatecas_, are continually guarded by five hundred
_Spaniards_, and as many Slaves.

                              New Biscay.


[Sidenote: Bounds of _New Biscay_.]

_New Biscay_, by some accounted a Province of _New Gallicia_, hath on
the South, _Zacatecas_; on the West, the Countrey of _Cinoloa_;
Northward it is bounded with _New Mexico_; the Eastern Borders of it
looking towards _Florida_, not yet well discover’d: so call’d by the
_Spaniards_, onely from its neighborhood to _New Gallicia_. It is, as
the other Provinces, exceeding rich in Silver Mines, and hath some also
of Lead; which serve principally, as some say, for the refining or
purging of the other Metal. The People generally are of a stout and
resolute Disposition, and with much difficulty submitting to the Yoke;
yea, the _Spaniards_ themselves confess, that there remain yet to this
day four great Towns unreduc’d, though they lie, as it were, in the
mid-way, betwixt the _Zacatecas_ aforesaid, and the Mines and Town of
_St. Barbara_ of this Province: The Spaniards call them _Las Quatro
Ceinegas_, or _The Four Quagmires_, as lying, perhaps, in the Marshes,
or in some Fenny and lower parts of the Countrey.

[Sidenote: Towns and Cities.]

The Towns which themselves hold, are, 1. _St. Barbara_, famous for the
rich Mines about it.

2. _St. Johns_, equal to the other, and not above three or four Leagues
distant from it.

3. _Ende_, the most Northerly Town which the _Spaniards_ have in this
Countrey, distant about twenty Leagues from the other.

These be all Colonies of the _Spaniards_, and built on purpose for
securing the Mines; which when they were first discover’d by _Yvarra_,
he order’d _Roderigo del Rio_ to guard the same, and took up his Winter
Quarters at _St. Juan_ in a strong House, stor’d with all manner of
Provisions, and erected there by him, as a place of defence against the
_Chichimecæ_, who (though the _Spaniards_ kept the place with strong
Guards) kill’d above four hundred of their Horses and Mules; which loss
no way daunted him, so as to change his Resolution of going to _Topia_:
whither travelling, he found many snowy Mountains, and suffer’d extream
Cold, which kill’d most of their Horses; being seen fifteen days after
to stand so stiffly frozen, as if still alive: at last getting within
the Borders of _Topia_, after he had suffer’d many inconveniences, he
was oppos’d by the Inhabitants, till he pacifi’d them with Presents.


                               SECT. II.

[Sidenote: Convenient Havens of _New Gallicia_.]

This Countrey hath many convenient Havens, _viz._ _San Jago_, _Navidad_,
_Malacca_, _Chacalla_, below the Promontory _Corientes_, the Bay
_Xalisco_, the Road _Massatlan_, and _Chiametla_, so call’d from a Town
about eleven Leagues from the Ocean.

Here, and in several places of _New Gallicia_, grow Lillies, Roses,
Violets, Jessamins, and many other Flowers; amongst which the
_Floripondium_ deserves peculiar observation, because it flourishes the
whole Year; and its white Blossoms, which are bigger than Lillies,
opening in the Morning, yield an exceeding sweet smell.

[Sidenote: The Flower _Granadilla_.]

In no less esteem is the _Murucuia_, by the _Spaniards_ call’d
_Granadilla_, which will not grow, if bereav’d of any of its Leaves: it
bears a Flower from the resemblance of our Saviour’s Suffering, call’d
_The Passion-Flower_, which exceeds the biggest Rose in circumference;
the uppermost Leaves green, those underneath of a purple colour; on the
top hangs a round Bush of a thousand interwoven threds of divers
colours, distinguish’d by white and red Specks; the pale Stalk which
sticks in the middle of the Flower, is divided into five others, that
bend downwards with a yellow Button-like Knob; on the middlemost Stalk
stands a pale yellow Flower, which appears three hours after Sun-rising,
and closes again a little before Sun-set; the Fruit, which is very
round, smooth, and of a pale Green, hath white Specks, a thick Rind,
Saffron-colour’d Pulp, which is wholsom, of a good rellish, and hath
abundance of black Seeds inclos’d in little Husks.

                              New Mexico.


[Sidenote: Bounds of _New Mexico_.]

_New Mexico_ (as ’tis call’d for distinction’s sake) is bounded on the
South-West with _New Biscay_; more directly Westward, with some parts of
_Quivira_; the Countreys Northward of it not yet discover’d; Eastward it
extends it self as far as _Florida_.

This Province doubtless for largeness may compare with _New Gallicia_,
having been search’d and discover’d by the _Spaniards_ above a hundred,
some say two hundred Leagues directly Eastward, and to the North-East:
and they report Wonders of it, if we may believe them, at least in
respect of what was generally found in these Northern parts of _America_
at their first Discovery; as namely, That they have Towns fairly and
well built of Lime and Stone, Houses of four Stories high, and most of
them provided with Stoves for the Winter Season, as well as any in
_Europe_; the Streets fair and broad, and the People as curious and
expert in divers Arts and Manufactures as any of theirs. More
particularly they tell us of a Town call’d _Chia_, of the Province of
_Cuames_, so big, that it is said to contain eight several
Market-places. Another call’d _Acoma_, a great Town, but seated on the
top of an high Rock, without any ordinary way of access to it, but by a
pair of Stairs hewn out of the hard Stone, or else by certain Ladders,
which the Inhabitants let down and take up as they please. And likewise
of a third, which they call _Conibas_, containing, as they say, no less
than seven Leagues in length, and about half so much in breadth, seated
upon a Lake, but scatteringly built, and much of the space taken up with
Mountains and many fair Gardens, in the midst of which the Town
standeth; of all which more hereafter. This is certain, that the
Countrey to which they give the Name of _New Mexico_, is of a vast
extent, reaching from the Mines of _St. Barbara_ in _New Biscay_
Eastward, and to the North-East, above two hundred Leagues already
discover’d, but doubtless taking up no small part of those Countreys
which are sometimes assign’d to _Florida_, if not of the Confines of
_Virginia_ also.

[Sidenote: Travels of _Ruyz_, _Espejus_ and others.]

This Countrey was first, _Anno 1581._ discover’d by a _Franciscan_ Monk,
nam’d _Augustine Ruyz_, who with two other Monks of his Order, got eight
Soldiers of _Conde de Coruna_, Vice-Roy of _New Spain_, for his
Companions; with whom he travell’d from the Valley _Sant Bartholomew_,
to the Province _De los Tiguas_, where one of the two Monks was kill’d
by the Natives, which occasion’d such a fear amongst the Souldiers, who
judg’d themselves too weak to make any resistance, that they resolv’d to
return, notwithstanding all the arguments which _Ruyz_ us’d to disswade
them from it; yet nevertheless he and his Brother _Franciscus Lopez_ and
four _Indians_, went onward of their Journey; which news the Souldiers
carried back to the _Franciscans_ in _Sant Bartholomew_; who fearing
their Brethren would be destroy’d, sent several Souldiers and a Monk,
call’d _Bernardyn Beltran_, after them, who were also accompanied by
_Antony Espejus_, who spent a great part of his Estate in raising of
Men, providing Arms and Provisions, loading therewith a hundred and
fifty Horses and Mules; with which he travell’d direct North from the
fore-mention’d Valley, and after two days Journey found a People call’d
_Conchi_, who went naked, and liv’d in Huts built together like a
Village: They were Govern’d by _Casiques_, fed on Hares, Deer, Rabbets,
_Maiz_, _Calabashes_, and Melons. Several adjacent Rivers afford them
plenty of Fish. They were amaz’d at the Crosses which the _Spaniards_
there erected, till they were inform’d of a Crucifi’d Saviour. _Espejus_
being every where kindly Entertain’d amongst them, and conducted twenty
two Leagues farther, came amongst the _Indians_ call’d _Passaguates_, of
the like Constitution with the _Conchi_’s; who had skill in Minerals,
and judg’d that there were many Silver Mines in that Countrey. From
whence the _Passaguates_ travell’d with the _Spaniards_ to the Borders
of the _Los Tobosos_, who no sooner saw them, but they fled, because a
few years before they had been miserably dealt with by the _Spaniards_;
but being inform’d by the Interpreters, that they needed not be afraid
of any thing, they all appear’d, and conducted _Espejus_ to the Borders
of the _Patarabueyes_; which People possess a large Countrey, Stone
Houses and Villages built in good order. Great Rivers which come out of
the North, and others that disembogu’d into the North Sea, afforded them
all sorts of Fish; as also the Woods plenty of Venison, Fowls, and
wholsom Plants. In some Pools also the salt Water afforded Salt.

The Valour of the Inhabitants may sufficiently appear by the rough
Entertainment which the _Spaniards_ met withall the first Night; for the
_Patarabueyes_ fell so fiercely upon them, that had not the Watch given
notice thereof in time, none had escap’d with Life; nevertheless five
Horses were kill’d, and a considerable number of Men wounded: after
which retreating, they went upon a neighboring Hill, whither _Espejus_
sent his Interpreter, and an _Indian_ the same Countrey, to inform them,
That the _Spaniards_ came not to molest them, and if they pleas’d to
come to them, they should meet with none but Friends; which was the more
easily credited, because the _Casiques_ receiv’d some Presents; after
which being reconciled, they conducted the _Spaniards_ twelve days
Journey up a long River, whose Banks were inhabited in several places.
From thence they reach’d to a Place, inhabited by a People richly
Cloth’d, who also seem’d to have some knowledge of God; for in their
Discourse they pointed up to Heaven, call’d the Creator and Preserver of
all things _Apalito_, and signifi’d that they had receiv’d that
Knowledge formerly from those that were left of _Pamphilius Narvaez_’s
Army, who having rang’d through _Florida_ were driven hither.

These People also Presented _Espejus_ many tann’d Skins, with which he
went to a great Village, the Inhabitants whereof were very courteous,
and barter’d them for brave Plumes of Feathers and Cotton Cloaks,
streak’d with blue and white: but _Espejus_ having no Interpreters whom
they could understand, could not learn by what Name they were known; yet
by signs they express’d what time of the year they had Precious Stones
brought to them; and also what their Countrey produced; and also that
abundance of those Riches was to be found in a Province about five days
Journey Westward from thence, whither they freely offer’d to conduct the
_Spaniards_, which accordingly they did, bearing them company one and
twenty Leagues to the next Province, inhabited by a People whose Name
also they could not be inform’d of, yet staying three days amongst them,
they were Entertain’d with Presents and Dances both Night and Day. The
Countrey afforded them also store of Venison and Fruits: Those that
understood Minerals, judg’d that there were likewise several Gold Mines.

Leaving this Province, they entred into a great Wilderness of
Pine-Trees, in which they travell’d twelve Leagues in fifteen days,
without seeing either Man or House; but at the end of the Wood they
spy’d a Village of Straw Huts, where there were great quantities of
white Salt, and Deer Skins neatly dress’d. The People of the Place
courteously Entertain’d the _Spaniards_, and conducted them along the
River _Del Norte_, to _New Mexico_: The Banks of the River on each side
was planted with Nut-Trees and Vines, which spread themselves out above
three Leagues; through which they had scarce pass’d three days together,
when they saw ten populous Villages pleasantly seated on the said River,
from whence came many thousands of the Natives to meet _Espejus_, who
was not so much amaz’d at the great number of People, as at their
extraordinary Civility and decent Habits; for they Entertain’d him with
well dress’d Meat, roasted Poultrey, and pleasant Fruits: Their Garments
were Cotton Cloaks, Deer-skin Breeches, Shoes and Boots of good Leather.
The Women wore their Hair neatly Comb’d and Pleited. Their Houses were
almost four Stories high, handsomely built, and divided into fair
Chambers, had Stoves or Cells under Ground against the Cold in the
Winter. Every Village was Govern’d by a _Casique_, whose Commands were
publish’d by the _Alguaziles_. Each House had a peculiar place in which
their Idol stood, before whom they set Meat twice a day. Near the
High-ways stood Temples very curiously painted, wherein their Deity, as
they say, diverted himself in his Progress from one Village to another.
At certain Distances near their Plough’d Lands, stood _Portico_’s,
supported on four Columns, under which the Husband-man us’d to eat, and
take his Noon-sleep. Besides their Swords, which were strong enough to
cut a Man through the Middle, they us’d Bowes and Arrows: Their Shields
were made of Deer Skins.

_Espejus_ having stay’d here four days, went to the Province _De las
Tiguas_, which had sixteen Villages; in the chiefest whereof, call’d
_Poala_, _Augustine Ruyz_ and his Brother Monk _Franciscus de Lopez_ had
been slain, besides four others; wherefore the People being conscious of
this Crime, and fearing that Revenge would follow, fled to the
Mountains, from whence they could not be enticed, whilst the _Spaniards_
found their Houses full of Provisions and some Minerals.

Now those being dead whom they sought for, some thought it convenient to
return; but _Espejus_ and _Beltran_ perswaded the contrary, alledging,
That farther up, according to the _Indians_ information, lay several
Provinces which were worth the discovery, and advis’d that the chiefest
part of their Forces might stay there, whilst they and some few resolute
Men went farther upon the Discovery, which accordingly was perform’d.
_Espejus_ having travell’d two days, came into a fruitful Province,
jutting against _Cibola_, in which he found eleven Villages, inhabited
by above fourteen thousand People, who were clad in Skins and Cotton,
worshipp’d many Idols, and receiv’d the _Spaniards_ with great Civility.

The like Entertainment they met withall in the Countrey _Los Quires_,
wash’d by the River _Del Norte_; near which stood five Villages,
inhabited by about fifteen thousand People.

Thirteen Leagues farther they found _De los Cunames_, having also five
Villages, the chiefest of which being _Cia_, boasted (as above
mention’d) eight Market-places: The Houses, made of Lime, were neatly
Painted, and compris’d in all above twenty thousand Persons, all civil
People, who presented _Espejus_ and his Company with handsom Cloaks, set
good boyl’d Meat before them, and shew’d them rich Minerals, and the
Mountains out of which they got the same.

Of the like Constitution were the Inhabitants _De los Amires_, which
being thirty thousand in number, resided in seven well built Villages,
lying North-West from _Cunames_.

After this they march’d Westward, and found the eminent Village _Acoma_,
mention’d before, built on an exceeding high Rock, to which led onely a
narrow Path up a pair of Stairs cut in the Rock; as also many Wells to
receive Rain, besides what they have out of a River, led by Moats round
about their Plough’d Lands. The _Spaniards_ staying here three days,
were Entertain’d with all sorts of good Meat, Dances and Drolls.

From hence travelling twenty four Leagues more Westerly, they entred the
Province of _Zuny_; where the erected Crosses which had remain’d there
till that time, were sufficient testimonies of _Cornaro_’s having been
there, after he was deserted by _Andreas de Cuyocan_. _Casper de
Mexico_, and _Antonius de Guadalajara_, being setled on _Zuny_,
(otherwise call’d _Cibola_) and speaking the _Indian_ Tongue better than
their Native Language, inform’d _Espejus_, that sixty days Journey
farther lay a great Lake, whose Shores were crown’d with many brave
Villages, inhabited by a People which wore Golden Armlets and Ear-rings;
whither _Franciscus Vasquez_ had gone a second time, had not Death
prevented him. This Information so encourag’d _Espejus_, that
notwithstanding it was so great a Journey, yet he resolv’d to venture
thither, though the Monk _Beltran_ and most of his Company perswaded him
to the contrary; whereupon _Beltran_ return’d: After which _Espejus_
went on to the said Lake; whither he was accompanied with a hundred and
fifty _Indians_. Having gone twenty six Leagues, he found a populous
Province, whose Borders he no sooner approach’d, but he was told, _That
if he was willing to lose his Life, he and his Party might enter into a
forbidden Dominion_; yet notwithstanding this threatning Message, he
wrought so much upon the _Casique_ by the Presents which he sent him,
that he was permitted to come in freely; nay, the Inhabitants of
_Zaguato_ strow’d Meal on the Earth for the _Spaniards_ to go over, and
presented _Espejus_ at his departure with forty thousand Cotton Cloaks,
and a considerable quantity of Plate, which he sent with five of his
Soldiers, and all the _Cibolan Indians_, back to _Cibola_, keeping onely
four Companions and one Guide, with whom he travell’d forty one Leagues
Westward; where he found a Mountain, to the top whereof led a broad
Path; which ascending, he took up Silver Oar with his own Hand. The
several sorts of People that inhabited here were all civil and
courteous, living in good fashion, in pretty large Houses, built on the
Banks of a pleasant River, shaded with Vines and Nut-Trees, and thick
planted with Flax: They inform’d _Espejus_, that near a River which runs
eight Miles towards the North Sea, were such stately Palaces, as could
not be beheld without great admiration. But _Espejus_ going back a plain
Road to _Cibola_, found not onely those whom he had sent from _Zaguato_,
but also _Beltran_, with the other Soldiers, who having been detained
there by the Civilities and kind Entertainments of the _Indians_, were
now upon returning home; so that _Espejus_ was left alone with eight
Soldiers, who resolv’d to venture their Lives and Fortunes with him.
They travell’d along the River _Del Norte_, through the Provinces _De
los Guires_ and _Habutas_, whose Mountains, over-spread with Pine-Trees
and Cedars, have many rich Mines. The Natives wore painted Cotton
Cloaks, and dwelt in stately Houses five Stories high. At the Borders of
the Realm _Los Tamos_ they were stopt, and not permitted to come on
farther; wherefore being but few in number, and several of them sick,
they judg’d it convenient to cross the River _De las Vaccas_ (so call’d
from the abundance of Cows that were thereabouts) to the River _Conchos_
and the Village _Bartholomew_, where _Espejus_ was inform’d, that
_Beltran_ was long before his arrival gone to _Guadiana_.

And now that we may have the better Account of _New Mexico_ (which
_Ruyz_, _Espejus_, and _Beltran_ endeavor’d to discover) it will be
necessary to begin with the first original thereof, according as several
ancient Histories make mention.

[Sidenote: First original of the _New Mexicans_.]

The most ancient Possessors of that part of _Northern America_ call’d
_New Spain_, were for their fierce and salvage Nature call’d
_Chichimecæ_, who dwelling in Caves, fed on Moles, Rabbets, Hedghogs,
Serpents, Roots and Herbs. Whilst the Women accompanied their Husbands
in their Travels, the Children were put into Baskets, and hang’d in a
Tree. No manner of Government was to be found amongst them. They never
Till’d their Ground till the _Navatlacans_ came from _New Mexico_ (which
was anciently divided into two Countreys, _Aztlan_ and _Teuculhuacan_)
to _New Spain_; after which they Sow’d their Lands.

The _Navatlacans_ (who us’d to dwell in Houses, worship Images, plough
their Lands, and obey their Governors) were divided into six Tribes,
each Tribe possessing their limited Bounds: and there goes a Tradition,
That out of six Pits that are to be seen in _New Mexico_, the
_Navatlacans_ had their original. The time when they deserted _New
Mexico_, as their most authentick Histories or Records declare, was
(according to our computation) _Anno 940._ and they farther affirm, that
they spent forty years in a Journey, which might have been travell’d in
a Moneth: The reason of which tediousness was, because they rested in
all places where they found a fruitful Countrey; but as they had advice
from their diabolical Spirits, which (as they say) appear’d visibly to
them, they still went on farther and farther, yet left behind those that
were aged, sick, and decrepid, building convenient Houses for them, and
appointing Overseers to look after them. The Ruins of the Houses are yet
to be seen on the Way along which they pass’d.

The six Tribes divided themselves after this manner: Four of them setled
round about the great Lake of _Mexico_. The _Sichumilans_ taking the
South part, built, besides two other Towns, a Metropolis of their own
Name, as the _Chalcans_ on the North. The _Tapunecans_ built
_Azcapuzalco_ in the West, which signifies _A Pismires Hole_, because of
the abundance of Inhabitants. The Eastern part was taken up by the
_Chalhuans_. And all these Names have a peculiar signification; the
first signifies _People of Flowry Fields_; the second, _People of
Mouthes_; the third, _People of Bridges_; and the fourth, _Crooked
People_. Not long after, the _Tatluicans_, a strong People, went over
the Mountains on the other side of the _Mexican_ Lake, where they built
several Towns on a hot, yet fruitful Soil, the chiefest whereof they
call’d _Quahunachua_, that is, _A Place where an Eagles Voice is heard_.
The _Tlascaltecans_ went near the Snowy Mountains, one of which, being
between _Mexico_ and _De los Angelos_, vomits horrid Flames and Smoke up
into the Skie. Here scattering up and down, they built several Villages,
besides the City _Tlascalla_; the Inhabitants whereof assisted the
_Spaniards_, as hath been related in the taking of _Mexico_, for which
good Service they live free, without paying any Tribute.

When these six Tribes came first from _Mexico_ thither, the
_Chichimecans_ made little or no resistance against them, but hid
themselves amongst the Rocks: yet some of them not long after taking
courage, flew to Arms, and had without doubt destroy’d the
_Tlascallans_, had not a subtile Plot sav’d them: for under a shew of
Friendship they falling on the unarm’d _Chichimecans_, kill’d every Man
of them.

_Joseph de Acosta_ tells us, that _Anno 1586._ he saw a Grave in
_Mexico_, wherein a _Chichimecan_ of a Gygantick size lay buried.

After this Conquest gotten by the _Tlascallans_, the fore-mention’d six
Tribes liv’d in Peace and Quiet, and strengthned themselves the more by
Marrying into one anothers Families.

The _Chichimecæ_ keeping on the Mountains left the new People in quiet
possession of their Lands, nay, learnt some of their Customs, insomuch
that they began to build Huts, chuse Governors, and live according to
their Laws.

[Sidenote: The first March of the _Mexicans_ into _New Spain_.]

The _Tlascallans_ having possess’d _New Spain_ three hundred and two
years, a seventh Tribe (a valiant and civiliz’d People) came thither,
upon their Dæmon _Viztlipuztli_’s promise of having the supream
Government: wherefore he was carried in an Ark by four chief Priests,
whom he inform’d whither and when they should travel or rest, for where
ever they stopt, they built a Tent in the middle of their Army for their
Idol, whom they set on an Altar; which done, they Sow’d the Ground about
them: yet if their _Dæmon_ commanded them to march before Harvest, then
they left the Product to the ancient and sick People. But at last
_Mexi_, from whence the Name of _Mexico_ is deriv’d, conducted the Army
into _Mechaocan_, where the pleasant Soil among the Lakes entic’d many
to take up their Habitation. But _Mexi_ proceeded on his Journey, yet
not without great Crosses, in regard _Viztlipuztli_’s Sister (some
Inchantress probably so call’d) did much hurt to the whole Army by her
Sorceries, because they would not honor her as a Goddess, till
_Viztlipuztli_ inform’d one of them that carried the Ark, that the Army
should march on, and banish the Witch from them: whereupon she
accordingly being driven away, built the Village _Malinalco_, as a
Habitation for Conjurers. Mean while, the Army grew weaker and weaker by
their leaving so many People behind them in most places; therefore they
judg’d it convenient to rest a while in _Tula_, where a great River
water’d the Countrey; which, according to _Viztlipuztli_’s Commands,
being dry’d up, made a large Lake about the Mountain _Coatepeck_, whose
Banks being planted with Willow and Poplar-Trees, were exceeding
pleasant, and the more, because of the variety of Birds that made their
Nests in the same; which so delighted many of the People, that being
tir’d with travelling, they resolv’d to settle there; which Resolution
was so ill resented by _Viztlipuztli_, that he commanded the Bank to be
broken, that the Water might have liberty to flow its former Course, and
threatned them with heavy punishments: after which in the Night a
terrible Cry of Murder was heard in one part of the Army; which being
inquir’d after the next Morning, they found divers People lying on the
Ground with their Breasts cut open, and their Hearts pull’d out:
whereupon those that remain’d went onto _Chapultepec_, where they
fortifi’d themselves in the Mountains against the adjacent People, which
_Copil_, Son to the _Malinalcon_ Witch, had rais’d up against them; and
soon after the _Tapunecans_ and _Chalcans_ went against their new
Neighbors, with whom they began a bloody Fight, when _Vitzilovitli_, at
that time General of the _Mexican_ Army, pressing in amongst them, broke
their Ranks, and made way for all his Army (though with his own Death)
to march Conquerors to _Culhuacan_: The Prince of which Province gave
them a Place to settle on, near the white Water _Ticaapan_, whose Shores
swarm’d with Adders and Serpents, upon Design that the Strangers might
be destroy’d by them; but it prov’d quite otherwise: for they without
regret eat the poysonous Animals; and Dunging the unfruitful Soil,
receiv’d a plentiful Harvest: They would willingly have setled here,
after their so long ranging up and down, if _Viztlipuztli_ would have
approv’d thereof; but he told them, that they must possess themselves by
Arms, and make a _Culhuacan_ Maid their Goddess: whereupon they desir’d
the _Casique_’s Daughter of _Culhuacan_, who was sent them in rich
Ornaments, and with a stately Retinue: But she was no sooner entred on
the _Ticaapan_ Shore, but they flay’d her alive, and her Skin being
stuff’d, and nam’d _Tocci_, was religiously worshipp’d. But not
satisfi’d with this cruelty, they sent for her Father to visit his
Daughter in her Dignity; who accordingly coming with great Attendance,
was led into a dark Chappel, where by the burning Tapers he knew the
Goddess to be no other than his Daughters Skin stuff’d full of Cotton;
whereat burning with rage, he afterwards fell upon these Murderers with
all his Forces, and drove them to the Place where they afterwards built
_Mexico_.

[Illustration: _Viztlipuztli idolum Mexicanorum._]

We have often made mention heretofore of the Governor of this Journey,
_Viztlipuztli_, it will therefore be necessary to give an exacter
Description of him, as followeth:

[Sidenote: Description of the Image _Viztlipuztli_.]

He was a woodden Image like a Man, sitting on a blue Seat in a
triumphant Chair; at each end of which was plac’d a Staff with a
Serpents Head upon it, from whose Forehead, which was Painted blue, ran
a Streak of the same colour, cross his Nose to both his Ears; upon his
Head stood a Plume of Feathers, the ends whereof were tipp’d with a
golden Varnish; his left Hand held a white Shield, on which stuck five
Feathers, and on the top a Laurel Bough; next the Shield lay four
Arrows, pretended to be sent from Heaven; in his right Hand a Truncheon,
full of blue crooked Streaks like Serpents; behind on his Shoulders
appear’d Wings, not unlike those of a Bat, his Eyes large and round, and
his Mouth reaching from Ear to Ear, made him terrible to behold, also
gaping, and full of Teeth, which stuck out of his Belly; in his Breast
also were two fiery Eyes, and under them a shrivell’d Nose; his Feet
ended in Claws, hung round about with Precious Jems, golden Boxes and
Shields set out with divers colour’d Feathers. The Curtain behind which
this Idol sat, was not drawn open except on a Feast-Day.

Next _Viztlipuztli_ stood generally a lesser Image, call’d _Tlaboc_, and
also the Goddess _Tocci_, Daughter to the Prince of _Culhuacan_, who (as
before mention’d) was flay’d by their _Dæmon_’s Command. Since which
time they suppos’d, that they were never more acceptable to their Gods,
than when they appear’d Cloth’d in another Man’s Skin; and accounted no
Offering better, than a Heart taken out of their Enemies Breast, since
their Spirit destroy’d so many after that manner in the Army at _Tula_.

[Sidenote: _Tocci_’s Festival.]

But _Tocci_, they say, had also a Son much inclin’d to Hunting, whose
Image they carry, attended by a thousand People, with the sound of Horns
and Trumpets, to an Arbor on a high Mountain; which being made of green
Leaves pleited, had in the middle an Altar, on which they set the Idol,
whilst the Multitude surrounded the Foot of the Mountain, and set all
the Bushes about the same on Fire; which done, they shouted and
hollow’d, and play’d on several Instruments; which frighting the wild
Beasts that lay shelter’d in the Woods, made them run to the top of the
Mountain, where they were more and more inclos’d by the People, insomuch
that many of them were slain for an Offering before _Tocci_’s Son’s
Altar; which done, they carried the Idol back to his Temple, and the
People made Merry with the slain Venison.

[Sidenote: Description of _Tezcatlipuca_’s Image.]

As great Reverence they shew’d to _Tezcatlipuca_, because (as they said)
he pardon’d their Sins. This Idol was made of a black shining Stone,
richly Apparell’d, having Golden Ear-rings; in his undermost Lip a
Silver Sheath, in which stuck sometimes a green, and sometimes a blue
Plume of Feathers; his Hair was ty’d with an embroider’d String, at the
end of which hung a Golden Ear, whereon Smoak was Painted, signifying
the Prayers of oppress’d Sinners; moreover, the String hung full of
Pearls, and about the Neck in a String hung a Jewel; on his Breast, as
also on his Navel, a green Stone; in his left Hand he held a Fan made of
a Gold Plate, in which stuck many colour’d Feathers: this Plate
glittering like Glass, was in stead of a Mirrour for _Tezcatlipuca_, to
observe all worldly Transactions in the same: and to punish Criminals,
he held four Darts in his right Hand. His Feast they kept once in four
years.

This Idol also had the Command of Hunger, Drought, Famine, and
pestilential Distempers; wherefore he had quite another shape, sat on a
Stool behind a red Curtain embroider’d with dead Mens Bones and Sculls;
his Body Coal black, his Head stuck full of Quails Feathers, a Quiver
with four Arrows in his left, and a Rod in his right Hand, which made
the Image seem very terrible.

The Idol _Quetzalcoalt_, being their Guardian over the Merchants, was
plac’d in a high Temple, being shap’d like a Man, his Face onely
excepted; for that resembled a Bird’s Head, with a red Bill full of
Teeth, a Comb, and a long Tongue; on the hind-part of his Head stood a
Mitre, and about his Legs Silk Garters beset with Pearls.

                               CHAP. IX.
                 Cibola, Tontonteac, and Nova Granada.


Though the Province of _Zuny_ above-mention’d in the Chapter of _New
Mexico_, in the Voyage of _Espejus_, be there otherwise call’d, and
appear to be the same with _Cibola_, yet we find it not treated of by
any as part of _New Mexico_, but by some as a distinct Province, by
others as a part of _California_ largely taken; for besides that
_California_, properly so call’d, hath formerly been taken rather for a
_Peninsula_ than an Island, and still affords to some an Argument of
question, whether it be one or the other. The whole extent of the
Province generally so term’d, hath been reputed to comprehend the
suppos’d _Peninsula_ it self, _Cibola_, _Quivira_, and _Nova Albion_;
but since, according to the best Maps and Discoveries, there seems
little doubt to be made, that _California_, strictly taken, is a perfect
Island: and since upon that Consideration we have reserved it to be
describ’d amongst the Islands of _Northern America_, we also
consequently judge it most requisite to consider those Countreys apart
that were included in the extended _California_.

[Sidenote: Situation, Temperature, and Productions of _Cibola_.]

_Cibola_ lieth Southward of _Quivira_, betwixt it and _New Gallicia_, to
the North and East: on the West it hath _Mar Vermiglio_, or the Bay of
_California_. The Air of the Province is indifferently temperate,
especially if compar’d to the sharp Frosts and Colds of _Quivira_. The
Countrey is for the most part level and plain, as _Quivira_ is, having
but few Trees in it, except here and there some Woods of Cedars, which
yet do abundantly supply the Natives both with Timber and Fewel. The
Ground affords plenty of _Maiz_, and some small white Pease, of both
which they usually make Bread. There is great store of Venison, and a
kind of Sheep (as they say, and as it should seem by their Fleece) as
big as some little Horses or Oxen, some of their Horns weighing forty or
fifty Pound: But perhaps by some mistake of Authors, this Beast may be
no other than _Taurus Mexicanus_, elsewhere describ’d, whose Hair is
extreamly thick and shaggy, and of which they make Cloth as of Wool, as
hath been said. There are also Lyons, Bears, and Tygers in this
Province, in such numbers, that the People of the Countrey are not a
little troubled with them, and would gladly destroy them if they knew
how. The People are generally well Limb’d, tall of Stature, and seem to
be a little more Ingenious than their Neighbors of _Quivira_; yet they
go naked many of them, onely cover’d with Mantles made of Skins, which
are many times painted, and that with such Curiosity and Art, as do
sufficiently argue, that neither themselves nor their Neighbors of
_Quivira_, from whom they have them in Traffick, do make them, but that
they are the Merchandise and Commodity of some other Nations, perhaps of
_Cathay_ or _China_, who, by the North-West Seas, do Trade with the
Maritime Parts, and People of _Quivira_.

This part of the Countrey hath been reasonably well search’d by the
_Spaniards_, but as yet nothing discover’d so considerable, as to
perswade them to stay in it.

That which seems most observable, is the great Lake _Tonteac_, situate
almost in the midst of the Province; upon which, or near unto it, they
found seven or eight old Towns of the Natives, some whereof contain’d
four or five hundred of their Cottages or little Houses, and were
fortifi’d also with Ramparts, and other Works of Defence, so as the
_Spaniards_ could not become Masters of them, but by Force and Storming:
In the attempt whereof _Vasquez Coronado_, their Commander in chief, was
twice beaten down with Stones by the Natives; yet at last carrying the
Place, he found in it good plenty of _Maiz_ indeed, which was some
refreshment to his Army, but nothing else: whereupon having nam’d the
Place _Granada_, in memory of the Vice-Roy of _New Spain_, who sent him
upon that Expedition, he departed. In his return homeward he fell upon a
certain Countrey, which he nam’d _Tucayan_, of which his Companions
report great matters; as first, of a certain River call’d _Huex_, on the
Banks whereof, in the space of twenty Leagues, or thereabouts, there
stand no less than fifteen good Burroughs, well built, and furnish’d
likewise with Stoves or Hot-houses, against the Cold, as in other
Countreys of _Europe_; as also of a very fruitful and pleasant Valley,
which they therefore call’d _Aroba de Corazones_; of another great Town
and Territory, call’d _Chichilticala_; and lastly, of the Valley of
_Nuestra Sennora_, or _Our Ladies Dale_, in the South parts of the said
Territory, all of them describ’d for such rich and delicious Places,
that some take them for the _Campi Elisii_ of _America_, especially
seeing the _Spaniards_ were never known to visit them a second time, the
Discoveries that have been made since being onely of the North-West
Parts of the Countrey, along the Coasts of _Mar Vermiglio_, and this no
farther than onely to give Name to certain Capes or Promontories which
they met with, as namely 1. _Porto de St. Clara_, near to the Mouth of
the River which they call _Rio del Nordt_. 2. _Las Playas._ 3. _St.
Michael._ 4. _Lago del Oro_, which bordereth on _Quivira_; and lastly,
_El Rey Coronado_, Eastward of that.

[Sidenote: _Tontonteac._]

_Tontonteac_ is mention’d by so few, and by those few so obscurely, that
it cannot well be determin’d to be any other than that Countrey which
lies about the great Lake _Tonteac_, above spoken of in _Cibola_, and
which being made Habitable by six or seven Towns not inconsiderable for
Habitations of native _Indians_, might haply pass for a distinct
Province. And perhaps the reason why this Province hath been so obscure,
and little taken notice of, might be from the ruine of these Towns by
War, or some other Accident: and to this purpose are the words of a late
Writer, _The Province of_ Tontonteac (saith he) _hath five Houses onely
left, which stand on the Shore of a salt Lake_.

[Sidenote: _Nova Granada_ a Province of _Northern America_.]

_Nova Granada_, besides that it is a generally known and describ’d
Province of _Southern America_, is also nam’d amongst the Provinces of
_Northern America_, particularly by _Bertius_, _Cluverius_, and
_Golnitzius_, and in some late Maps of _America_ so conspicuously
specifi’d, that it might appear to be all that Tract of Land which
contains both _New Mexico_ and the several Provinces adjoyning to it;
but since we find it not describ’d by any at large, it will with most
verisimility pass for that part of _New Mexico_ where stands the City of
_St. Foy_; and this is most plainly express’d by Monsieur _Martini_,
though there are who confound _Cibola_ with _New Granada_. Waving which
Decision, we shall onely insert a short Description of the Place,
according to _Cornato_, who seems to have been one of the first
Discoverers of these Parts, and whose Credit is preferr’d before that of
_Marcus de Niza_.

[Sidenote: Its Description.]

_Nova Granada_ (saith he) consists of seven Villages, built in the
circumference of four Leagues, the chiefest whereof boasts two hundred
Houses, which for the most part are four or five Stories high, and built
of Stone; the Cellars thereto belonging, being neatly Pav’d, serve for
Stoves against the Cold: they ascend to their upper Rooms by Ladders.
The Inhabitants go naked, onely some Covering about their Middle, and
over their Shoulders Cotton Cloaks, painted with divers Colours. They
live on _Maiz_, white Pease, Hares, Rabbets, and Venison: their Salt
wherewith they season the same, they fetch from a neighboring Lake. The
Turkies, which they have in great numbers, are kill’d onely for their
Feathers, notwithstanding their Flesh is exceeding good Meat. The Soil
is for the most part plain, yet hath some high Mountains; and the
Pastures flourish with Grass. The Woods abound with Bears, Tygers,
Lyons, wild Hogs, Rhinocerots, and the like ravenous Beasts, which make
the Ways dangerous for Travellers. Besides large Deer, there are also
Sheep, which in bigness may compare with Horses, having exceeding great
Horns, and little Tails.

Concerning the abundance of _Turkoises_, of which _Niza_ makes mention,
_Cornato_ could give no certain account, because a little before his
Arrival the _Granadians_ had convey’d their Children, which were under
fifteen, and the aged People, who were above sixty years of age, with
their chiefest Goods, into remote places. However, it is not unknown,
that this Countrey affords _Turkoises_; for _Cornato_ in his Journey to
_Quivira_, Besieg’d a City in these Parts near a great River; the
Inhabitants whereof, when they were not able to defend themselves any
longer, throwing their Cloaks, _Turkoises_, and other Riches into the
Fire, Sallied out upon the _Spaniards_, and died not altogether
unreveng’d, as shall be specifi’d more at large in the Description of
_Tignes_, which being nam’d among the Towns of _Quivira_, will upon the
comparing of Circumstances, be apparently found to be the same with
this.

Lastly, _New Granada_ hath no Fruit-Trees, but little Cedars fit for
Building.

                                CHAP. X.
                                Quivira.


_Quivira_ is the next Region accounted of _California_, largely taken;
yet appearing by some Charts to lie so vastly remote, that all _New
Mexico_, _Gallicia_, and other Provinces already mention’d, lie between
that and the Island. And whereas _New Granada_ is by several made a part
of _New Mexico_; yet most certain it is, that by some it is confounded
with this Countrey, or at least accounted a part thereof, as hereafter
shall more plainly appear, according to the Account of those that have
most fully and particularly describ’d it.

[Sidenote: Situation of _Quivira_, and Description of the Inhabitants.]

_Quivira_ takes up the most Northern and unknown part of _America_
towards the West, reaching as far as the supposed _Straight_ of _Anian_
aforesaid (if there be any such) or else joyning to the Continent of
_Tartary_. It is likewise the least fruitful of all the _West-Indies_,
especially for Corn. Cattel it hath good store, and Pasturage
indifferent good, the Countrey being for the most plain and level, and
nothing else but Pasturage. The Natives are few and salvage, living in
Hoards or great Companies together, after the manner of the _Tartars_,
to whom they are Neighbors, and (as it is not improbably thought) of
their Race. The Men Clothe themselves most commonly in that kind of Oxes
Hide, elsewhere spoken of under the Name of _Taurus Mexicanus_. The
Women wear little else but their Hair, notwithstanding the Countrey,
especially for one half of the year, is excessive cold. Their Cattel,
though they are much less than the ordinary Kine of _Europe_, are the
chief Sustenance and Employment of the Natives; by Pasturing huge Herds
whereof from place to place, the People live, and maintain a Traffick
with other Parts. Yet some of them inhabit Towns, the chief whereof, as
yet discover’d, seem to be these which follow:

[Sidenote: Towns of chief note.]

1. _Acus_, or _Acuco_, a small Town, but seated in a strong defensible
place, and being a great Staple for Cotton, the Territory about it hath
been taken for a distinct Province, and by some call’d _The Kingdom of
Acuco_.

2. _Tignes_, a Town seated upon the Banks of a River bearing the same
Name, and inhabited, it seems, by a stout and resolute People, and whom
the _Spaniards_, coming amongst them in the Year 1540. had much ado to
master: for they endur’d a Siege for the space of six Weeks; and at last
finding themselves so strongly begirt by their Enemies, that there was
no means to escape but by Death, or yielding up themselves, rather than
they would fall alive into their hands, they first buried and spoil’d
all such Treasure as they had (which were chiefly Saphires, and a few
other Gems, that the Countrey afforded) and after that setting on fire
their Housholdstuff, they took their Wives and Children with them, and
made a desperate Sally out upon the _Spaniards_; wherein although they
were most of them slain, and trod under the Horses Feet, or drown’d in
passing the River, yet was it not without some loss to the _Spaniards_
themselves: nor would those few that were left behind deliver up the
Town, till it was fir’d about their Ears, and that they could no longer
abide in it. This Town, by all Circumstances, must needs be the same
with that before mention’d in _Nova Granada_, which makes good what we
have said above, _viz._ That _New Granada_ is by some confounded with,
or at least taken for a part of this Region.

3. _Cicuic_, another small Town, four days Journey from _Tignes_. The
Countrey about this place, although generally it be all good Pasturage,
and maintains abundance of Cattel, yet is it so open and plain, that for
almost a hundred Miles together, the _Spaniards_, in their March hither
from _New Spain_, found neither Stone nor Tree, nor any thing else that
could serve them for a Land-mark; so that they were forc’d, as they
march’d along, to raise up Heaps of Cow-dung, to serve them for
direction in their coming back, which was not long after: for not
finding the Commodities they sought for, and fearing to be surpris’d by
Winter in those cold Countreys, where they had no kind of accommodation,
they made somewhat a hasty Retreat, leaving behind them onely some few
Religious Men, of the Order of _St. Francis_, whose Endeavours to do the
People good by Converting them to the true Knowledge and Worship of
Almighty God, procur’d them not long after, the Crown of Martyrdom,
being murder’d all of them, except one, by the Natives, and he not
without much difficulty escaping their Hands.


[Sidenote: _Nova Albion._]

_Nova Albion_ was so denominated by Sir _Francis Drake_, when he was
there Entertain’d by the King of that Countrey; but whether it were in
_Quivira_ that he was thus Entertain’d, and left that Denomination, or
in the Island of _California_, appears not either from the Relation, or
from the common Consent of Cosmographers, since some there are, who will
have _Quivira_ and _Nova Albion_ to be one and the same Province; others
reckon it to be the utmost North-West part of _California_; others make
it distinct from _Quivira_, yet determine it not to the Island
_California_, seeming rather to make it an adjoyning Countrey to
_Quivira_: wherefore finding little else that concerns the Description
of the Place, except the said Voyage of _Drake_, we shall here set it
down, and leave the farther Disquisition concerning the Situation of the
Place, till we come to describe the Island of _California_ it self.

[Sidenote: Sir _Francis Drake_’s Arrival there.]

Captain _Francis Drake_ set Sail from _Plymouth_ _Anno 1577._ and after
much hardship getting through the _Straights_ of _Magellan_, arriv’d in
the Haven _Guatulco_, having before his coming thither taken as many
rich _Spanish_ Ships in the Southern Ocean as he could possibly have
wish’d for, so that his onely care now needed to have been how to get
safe home; yet he put on a Resolution, not to come short of _Ferdinandus
Magellanus_, who Saild about the World. Which brave Resolution of
_Drake_’s was approv’d of by all his Sea-men; whereupon he set Sail
along the North of _California_ the fifth of _June_; being gotten into
forty two Degrees, which was the farthest that _Cabrillo_ went, he came
on a sudden out of a warm Air into so frigid a Climate, that the Sea-men
were almost kill’d with Cold, and the farther they went, the colder it
grew; wherefore falling down three Degrees more Southerly, they got into
a convenient Haven, where the Natives who liv’d along the Shore brought
them Presents; which _Drake_ left not unrequited, by returning them
others, that were to them more novel, and not unuseful.

[Sidenote: Nature and Habit of the People.]

These People are exceeding hardy; for, notwithstanding the extraordinary
coldness of the Climate, the Men go naked; but the Women wear Garments
of pleited Flags or Rushes, which being put about their Middle, hang
down to their Ancles; on their Stomachs hang the ends of a hairy Skin
ty’d together, which hanging also over their Shoulders, cover their
hinder Parts. They shew great Respect and Obedience to their Husbands.
Each House is surrounded with an Earthen Wall, and all the Corners
thereof being close stopp’d, and Fires made in the midst of them, they
are very warm. Rushes and Flags strow’d thick on the Ground near the
Walls, serve them in stead of Beds.

The _Indians_ coming a second time to Visit the _English_, brought them
Plumes of Feathers, Neckbands of Net-work, and store of Tobacco: _Drake_
pleas’d with this their kindness, built Tents on the Brow of a Hill, on
the top of which the _Indians_ stood that brought the Presents, whil’st
one of them with a loud voice maintain’d a long Discourse; which he had
no sooner ended, but every one laid down his Bowe and Arrows, and walk’d
unarm’d down to the Tents to proffer their Gifts: their Wives staying
behind on the top, pinch’d their Cheeks, and made sad lamentation; which
_Drake_ suppos’d was because they made Offerings there: whereupon he
also caus’d all his Men to kneel down and say their Prayers, which made
the _Indians_ to look very earnestly upon them, and to return him the
Presents which the day before they had receiv’d of him.

[Illustration]

[Sidenote: _Drake_’s Entertainment by the King of the Countrey.]

The rumour of these Strangers arrival spreading all over the Countrey,
made the Inhabitants far and near desirous to see them; the King himself
sending Ambassadors to _Drake_, to inform him that he was on the Way
coming to see him; all which the Agents related at large, and desir’d
some Presents, as a testimony that their King should be welcome; which
he being assur’d of, came with a Retinue of above twelve thousand Men,
before whom walk’d one of a Gygantick size, carrying a costly Scepter,
on which, by three long Chains made of Bones, hung a great and a small
Crown made of Feathers; next follow’d the King himself in a Sute of
Cony-Skins; then came a great confus’d company of People, each of them
carrying a Present: whereupon _Drake_ putting his Men into good order,
march’d to meet the King; at which the Mace-bearer made a long Preamble,
and when he had done, Danc’d to the Tune of a Song, which he Sung
himself; then the King and his whole Retinue also fell a Singing and
Dancing so long, till being weary the King went to _Drake_, and humbly
desir’d of him, that he would accept of the Realm, assuring him, that
all the People should be under his Obedience; which said, he put the
fore-mention’d Crown on his Head, and hanging three double Chains about
his Neck, call’d him _Hioh_: whereupon _Drake_ took possession of the
Countrey in Queen _Elizabeths_ Name. The King staying alone with
_Drake_, his Retinue went amongst the _English_, every one looking very
earnestly upon them, and to those whom they lik’d best, being the
youngest, they falling down and crying, proffer’d Offerings, as to Gods,
and held their Cheeks to draw Blood out of them; which the _English_
refusing, they desisted; but shew’d them great Wounds, and desir’d some
Plaisters of them, which they suppli’d them with.

[Sidenote: A Monument erected by _Drake_ before his departure.]

The _English_ going up into the Countrey found the same well grown with
Woods, which abounded with Coneys, whose Heads differ’d little from the
_European_, but having Feet like Moles, long Tails like Rats, and in
their Sides a Bag, wherein when they had fill’d their Bellies they put
the remainder. They also saw numerous Herds of Deer, with whose Flesh
having been courteously Entertain’d in several Villages, they return’d
to the Fleet. _Drake_, just before he weighed Anchor, caus’d a pillar to
be set in the Ground with a Silver Plate on the same, with an
Inscription, mentioning the Day of his Arrival, Name and Arms of Queen
_Elizabeth_, and free delivering of that Realm to him by the _Indians_:
he also nail’d a Sixpence with the Queens Effigies on the Plate, under
which he caus’d his own Name to be Engraven.

                               CHAP. XI.
  _Terra Nova_, or _New-found Land_, with the Island of _Assumption_.


Having treated at large of all the several Regions and Provinces of the
North part of the Continent of _America_, we come now to those Islands
that lie within the same Degrees of Northern Latitude with that part of
the Continent: The first is _Terre Neuve_, or _New-found_ Land,
discover’d together with several other Parts upon the Continent before
mention’d by Sir _Sebastian Cabott_, by the Countenance and Charge of
King _Henry_ the Seventh of _England_; whereupon a rightful Claim
thereunto, and Interest therein, hath been own’d by the succeeding Kings
of _England_, as hereafter shall be more particularly related.

[Sidenote: Situation and Bounds of _New-found Land_.]

_New-found Land_ is situated betwixt the Degrees of forty six and fifty
three of Northern Latitude, and is divided from the Continent of
_America_ by an Arm of the Sea, in like distance as _England_ is from
_France_. The Island is as large as _England_ in length, greater in
breadth, and lies near the Course that Ships usually hold in their
Return from the _West-Indies_, and is near the mid-way between _Ireland_
and _Virginia_.

adiacentibus.]

[Sidenote: Temperature.]

We shall not much need to commend the wholsom temperature of this
Countrey, seeing the greatest part thereof lieth above three Degrees
nearer to the South, than any part of _England_ doth, so that even in
the Winter it is pleasant and healthful as _England_ is.

[Sidenote: Nature of the Inhabitants.]

The natural Inhabitants of the Countrey, as they are but few in number,
so are they something a rude and salvage People, having neither
knowledge of God, nor living under any kind of Civil Government. In
their Habits, Customs, and Manners, they resemble the _Indians_ of the
Continent, from whence it is to be suppos’d they come; they live
altogether in the North and West part of the Countrey, which is seldom
frequented by the _English_; but the _French_ and _Biscainers_ (who
resort thither yearly for the Whale-fishing, and also for the Cod-fish)
report them to be an ingenuous and tractable People (being well us’d)
and very ready to assist them with great labour and patience, in the
killing, cutting, and boyling of Whales, and making the Trayn-Oyl,
without expectation of other Reward than a little Bread, or some such
small Hire.

[Sidenote: Commodious Harbors.]

It hath the most commodious Harbours in the World, and the most safe
Seas to Sail to it, there being not any Islands, Rocks or Sands between
the _Lands-End_ in _England_ and _New-found Land_, and for the most part
it is not above three or four Weeks Sail thither, and less coming back;
and is the most commodiously situated for the discovering of the
North-West Passage, and other Inlets into the South Sea; whereby the
ordinary Voyages to _China_, _Japan_, and the _East-Indies_, are much
eas’d in the expence of Time and Charge; and the most open to Trade to
all Parts, of any Island of the _West-Indies_.

On the East side of the Land, are the Bays of _Trinity_ and
_Conception_, which stretch themselves towards the South-West.

_Tor-Bay_ and _Capelin-Bay_ lying also on the East, stretch themselves
towards the West.

The Bays of _Trespassey_, _St. Mary_, _Borrel_, and _Plaisance_, on the
South part of the Land, extend their Arms towards the North.

The great Bay of _St. Peters_ lying on the South-West side of the Land,
and Southerly from the great River of _Canada_, being about twenty
Leagues distant, the same stretcheth toward the East.

_Trinity_ Harbour lies in near forty nine Degrees of North Latitude,
being very commodiously seated to receive Shipping in seasonable
Weather, both to Anchor in, and from thence to Sail towards either the
East, West, or South. It hath three Arms or Rivers, long and large
enough for many hundred Sail of Ships to moare fast at Anchor near a
Mile from the Harbours Mouth. Close adjoyning to the Rivers side, and
within the Harbour, is much open Land, well stor’d with Grass
sufficient, Winter and Summer, to maintain great store of ordinary
Cattel, besides Hogs and Goats, if such Beasts were carried thither; and
it standeth North most of any Harbor in the Land, where our Nation
practiseth Fishing: It is near unto a great Bay lying on the North side
of it, call’d _The Bay of Flowers_; to which Place no Ships repair to
Fish, in regard of sundry Rocks and Ledges lying even with the Water,
and full of danger.

The bottom of the Bay of _Trinity_ lieth within four Leagues through the
Land South-West, Southerly from _Trinity_, as by experience is found;
and it comes near unto the Bay of _Trespassey_, and the bottom of some
other Bays.

_Trespassey_ in like manner is as commodious a Harbour, lying in a more
temperate Climate, almost in forty six Degrees of North Latitude, and is
both fair and pleasant, and a wholsom Coast free from Rocks and Shelves;
so that of all other Harbours it lies the most South of any in the Land,
and most conveniently to receive our Shipping, passing to and from
_Virginia_ and the _Bermuda_ Islands; and also any other Shipping that
shall pass to and from the River of _Canada_, and the Coast thereof,
because they usually pass, and so return in the sight of the Land of
_Trespassey_, and also for some other purposes, as shall be partly
declar’d in the following Discourse.

[Sidenote: Fruitful Soil.]

The Soil of this Countrey in the Valleys and sides of the Mountains is
so fruitful, as that in divers places the Summer naturally produceth
without Tillage, great plenty of green Pease, and Fitches, fair, round,
full, and as wholsom as ours in _England_.

[Sidenote: Berries and Fruits.]

Of Berries and Fruits, there grows Strawberries, red and white, and as
fair Raspice-berries and Goose-berries as there be in _England_; as also
Bilberries, which are call’d by some _Whortes_, and many other delicate
Berries peculiar to the Countrey, in great abundance. Likewise small
Pears, Cherries, Filberds, _&c._

[Sidenote: Herbs and Flowers.]

There are also Herbs for Sallets and Broth, as Parsly, Alexander,
Sorrel, _&c._ and also Flowers, as the red and white Damask Rose, with
other kinds, which are most beautiful and delightful, both to the sight
and smell. And questionless, the Countrey is stor’d with many Physical
Herbs, though their Vertues are not known.

When Corn was first Sow’n here, it was observ’d to grow very fair, the
increase was great, and the Grain very good; and several sorts of
Kitchin Plants that have been Set here, have prov’d very well.

[Sidenote: Beasts.]

In divers parts of the Countrey there is great store of Deer, and some
Hares, many Foxes, Squerrils, Beavers, Martins and Otters, yielding
excellent Furrs, Wolves and Bears, with other sorts of Beasts, serving
as well for Necessity, as for Profit and Delight.

[Sidenote: Birds.]

Variety both of Land and Water-Fowl is in this Countrey infinite: The
chief Land-Fowl, besides a great number of small Birds, that live by
scraping their Food from the Earth in the hardest Winter, are Hawks,
great and small Partridges, Thrush, and Thrussels abundance, very fat;
as also Filladies, Nightingales, and such like, which sing most
pleasantly. There are also Birds that live by prey, as Ravens, Gripes,
Crows, _&c._ For Water-Fowl, there is certainly so good, and as much
variety, as in any part of the World, as Geese, Ducks, Pigeons, Gulls,
Penguins, and many other sorts. These Penguins are as big as Geese, but
do not flye, for they have but a little short Wing; and they multiply so
infinitely upon a certain flat Island, that men drive them from thence
upon a Board into their Boats by hundreds at a time, as if God had made
the innocency of so poor a Creature to become such an admirable
Instrument for the sustentation of Man: And also Godwits, Curlews, and
such like; which Fowl do not onely serve those that Trade thither for
Food, but also they are a great furthering to divers Ships Voyages,
because the abundance of them is such, that the Fisher-men do bait their
Hooks with the quarters of Sea-Fowl on them; and therewith some Ships do
yearly take a great part of their Fishing Voyages with such Bait, before
they can get others.

[Sidenote: Springs.]

The fresh Waters and Springs of that Countrey are many in number, and
withall so very pleasant, delightful and wholsom, that no Countrey in
the World hath better: And Fewel for Fireing, no where more plentiful.

[Sidenote: Trees.]

In like manner there is great abundance of Trees fit to be employ’d in
other serviceable uses: There are Fir and Spruce-Trees, sound, good, and
fit to Mast Ships with, and as commodious for Boards and Buildings as
those of _Norway_; and out of these come abundance of Turpentine.
Moreover the Pine and Birch-Trees here are scarce to be compar’d for
heighth and greatness.

The Rivers also and Harbours are generally stor’d with delicate Fish, as
Salmons, Peals, Eels, Herrings, Mackrel, Flounders, Launce, Capelin,
Cod, and Trouts, the fairest, fattest and sweetest, that ever were seen
in these Parts. The like for Lobsters, Cra-fish, Mussles, and other
variety of Shell-fish.

The Seas likewise all along the Coast, do plentifully abound in other
sorts of Fish, as Whales, _Spanish_ Mackrel, Dorrel, Pales, Herrings,
Hogs, Porposes, Seals, and such like Royal Fish, _&c._

But the chief Commodity of _New found Land_ yet known, and which is
grown to be a setled Trade, and that it may be much better’d by an
ordinary Plantation there, (if the Traders thither will take some better
course than formerly they have done, as shall be declared) is the
Cod-fishing upon that Coast, by which our Nation and many other
Countreys are enrich’d.

Almost incredible is the benefit of the Fish, which the _French_,
_Biscainers_, and _Portuguese_ fetch yearly from this Coast of
_New-found Land_, and the _Bank_, which lieth within twenty five Leagues
from the South Cape of that Countrey, where the _French_ use to Fish
Winter and Summer, usually making two Voyages every year thither. To
which Places, and to the Coast of _Canada_, which lieth near unto it,
are yearly sent from those Countreys, more than four hundred Sail of
Ships.

This Island of _Terra Nova_ belongs properly and justly to the Crown of
_England_, having been under the sole Jurisdiction of the _English_ from
the first Discovery thereof, which was by Sir _Sebastian Cabot_,
Employ’d by King _Henry_ the Seventh, to find out some other part of
_America_, than what had been discover’d by _Columbus_, as hath been
above declar’d in several places.

Afterwards King _Henry_ the Eighth continu’d the _English_ Interest
there, and Employ’d one _Rutt_ into that Island, in order to the
Plantation thereof.

Queen _Elizabeth_ no less careful to preserve that Plantation, sent Sir
_Humphrey Gilbert_, a _Devonshire_ Knight, to plant a Colony there, the
better to secure the same, and to increase Trading there; and
accordingly the said Sir _Humphrey_ with two good Ships and a Pinnace in
her Name, took possession of that Countrey, in the Harbour of _St.
Johns_. He Sail’d from thence towards _Virginia_, and by reason of some
unhappy direction in his Course, the greatest Ship he had struck upon
Shelves on the Coast of _Canada_, and was there lost, with most part of
the Company in her; and he himself, being then in a small Pinnace of
twenty Tun, in the company of his Vice-Admiral (Captain _Hays_)
returning towards _England_, in a great Storm, was overwhelm’d in the
Sea, and so perish’d.

In the Year 1608. it was undertaken anew by _John Guy_, a Merchant of
_Bristol_, and with so good success, that the Colony in a short time
were well furnish’d with Wheat, Rye, Barley, and other Grain of their
own Sowing, with Turnips, Coleworts, and abundance of other necessary
things, not without some probable hopes of Metals, a certain and
plentiful Trade of Sables, Musk, and other rich Commodities.

[Sidenote: The Province of _Avalon_ in _New-found Land_.]

In the Year 1620. Sir _George Calvert_ Knight, then principal Secretary
of State, and a Privy Councellor to King _James_ the First of _England_,
&c. purchas’d a part of _New-found Land_, which was afterwards in the
Year 1623. granted to him and his Heirs by Patent from the said King,
under the Great Seal of _England_, bearing Date the seventh of _April_,
in the One and twentieth Year of his Reign: by which means the said
Tract of Land was erected into a Province, and at the Instance of the
said Sir _George Calvert_, call’d _Avalon_, from _Avalon_ in
_Sommerset-shire_, where _Christianity_ was first Planted in England.

This Province lies in the forty seventh Degree of Northern Latitude, and
is thus bounded: It begins Southerly from the middle part of a certain
Neck of Land or Promontory, situate between the two Harbours, _Fermose_
and _Aquafort_; and from thence following the Shore towards the North
unto the middle part, or half way over a little Harbour, call’d in that
regard _Petit Port_, or _Petit Harbour_, which boundeth upon the South
part of the Plantation of _St. Johns_, including the one half of a
certain fresh River, that falleth into the said Port of _Petit Harbour_;
and so tending along the South Border of the said Colony of _St. Johns_,
extendeth it self to a certain little Bay, commonly call’d _Salmon
Cove_, lying on the South side of the Bay of _Conception_, including the
one half of the River that falleth into the said _Cove_, as also one
half of the _Cove_ it self; from whence passing along the Shore of the
said Bay towards the South, and reaching unto the bottom thereof, where
it meets with the Lands of the fore-mention’d _John Guy_, nam’d
_Sea-Forrest_, is bounded with a certain River or Brook, which there
falleth into the Sea, and from the Mouth of the said Brook ascendeth
unto the farthest Spring or Head thereof; from thence passing towards
the South for six Miles together along the Borders of the said _John
Guy_’s Plantation, and there crossing over Westward in a right Line,
reacheth unto the Bay of _Placentia_, and the space of one League within
the said Bay from the Shore thereof; whence turning again towards the
South, passeth along the Harbour of _Placentia_, with the like distance
from the Shore, and descending unto _New Falkland_ towards the North and
West part thereof, stretcheth it self in a right Line Eastward,
continuing the whole Southerly length upon the Bounds of the said _New
Falkland_, unto the middle part or Point of the Promontory, or Neck of
Land before mention’d, between the Ports _Fermose_ and _Aquafort_; at
which place is describ’d and finish’d the Perambulation of the whole
Precinct, whose Extent may be thus computed, commencing from the
Promontory between the Ports _Fermose_ and _Aquafort_, which is fifty or
sixty Miles from South to North distant from _Petit Harbour_; from
whence crossing Westward to the Bay of _Placentia_, is judg’d to be
sixty Miles more or upwards, from East to West.

And thereby was also granted to the said Sir _George Calvert_ and his
Heirs, all Islands and Islets, within ten Leagues of the Eastern Shore
of the said Region towards the East, together with the Fishing of all
sorts of Fish, saving unto the _English_ free liberty of Fishing, as
well in the Seas as in the Ports and Creeks of the Province aforesaid,
and the Priviledges of salting and drying their Fish upon the Shores of
the said Province, as heretofore they reasonably us’d and enjoy’d the
same, so as they do no injury or notable loss or detriment unto the Lord
Proprietary, his Heirs and Assigns, or to the Inhabitants of the said
Province, in the Ports, Creeks, and Shores aforesaid, and especially in
the Woods growing within the said Province.

And by the said Patent all Royal Jurisdictions and Prerogatives, both
Military and Civil, within the said Province and Islands thereunto
belonging, were farther granted to the said Sir _George Calvert_ and his
Heirs, and he and they thereby created the true and absolute Lords and
Proprietaries of the said Province, saving the Allegiance due to His
Majesty, His Heirs and Successors, to be held of them in _Capite_,
yielding and paying unto them therefore a white Horse, when, and as
often as any of them shall come into the said Province, and the fifth
part of all Gold and Silver Oar which should be found there.

Sir _George Calvert_, before the obtaining of this Patent, had caus’d a
fair House and Fort to be built in the said Province, at a place call’d
_Ferryland_, and in the Year 1624. having obtain’d a Dismission from his
Employment of Secretary of State, and being then created Lord
_Baltemore_ of _Baltemore_ in _Ireland_, he did in the Year 1627.
Transport himself to _Avalon_, to inspect his Concerns there in Person;
from whence returning the same year, he Embarqu’d himself again,
together with his Lady and all his Family, except his eldest Son, for
_Avalon_ the year following; at which time (there being then War between
_England_ and _France_) he redeem’d above twenty Sail of _English_
Ships, which had been taken there that year by _French_ Men of War,
whereof one Monsieur _De la Rade_ had the chief Command, and shortly
after took six _French_ Fishing-Ships upon that Coast, and sent them the
same year, with a great many _French_-men Prisoners, into _England_.
Coming thence, he left a Deputy there, and continu’d the Plantation till
his Death, which was in _April 1632._ After whose Decease it descended
of right to his Son and Heir _Cecil_, now Lord _Baltemore_; who
thereupon sent one Captain _William Hill_ as his Deputy thither, to take
possession thereof, and to manage his Interest there for him. Captain
_Hill_, according to his Commission, shortly after repair’d thither, and
liv’d some years at the Lord _Baltemore_’s House at _Ferryland_ above
mention’d.

In the thirteenth Year of King _Charles_ the First, of _England_, &c.
about the Year of our Lord 1638. Marquess _Hamilton_, Earl of
_Pembroke_, Sir _David Kirk_, and others, under pretence that the Lord
_Baltemore_ had deserted that Plantation, obtain’d a Patent of all
_New-found Land_, wherein _Avalon_ was included, and shortly after
dispossess’d the Lord _Baltemore_ of his Mansion House in _Ferryland_,
and other Rights there, and during the late Rebellion in _England_ kept
possession; but His now Majesty King _Charles_ the Second, immediately
after his most happy Restauration in the Year 1660, upon the now Lord
_Baltemore_’s Petition, thought fit to refer the whole Matter to be
Examin’d by Sir _Orlando Bridgeman_, then Lord-Chief-Justice, now Lord
Keeper of the Great Seal of _England_, and others, to report the true
state thereof to His Majesty, together with their Opinions thereupon:
The Referrees accordingly, upon full hearing of Council on both sides,
certifi’d, That they conceiv’d the said Patent to Sir _George Calvert_,
to be a good Patent, in force, and not avoided by the later to Sir
_David Kirk_ and others; and that the Title and Interest to the said
Province did therefore belong to the Lord _Baltemore_. Whereupon His
Majesty, on the twentieth of _March_ in the same Year, Order’d the
Possession thereof to be re-deliver’d to his Lordship, which was
accordingly executed: Since which time his Lordship has peaceably
enjoy’d the possession thereof, and continues the Plantation to this
day, by deputing Lieutenants there from time to time, for the better
Government of that Province, the rest of _New-found Land_ remaining
still to the aforesaid Proprietors, claiming by the Patent of 13 _Car._
1.

The Commodities that are either by Art or Nature produc’d there, are the
same with those of the remainder of _New-found Land_. The Winter there
is extream cold, the Summer very hot, but withal pleasant; and during
that Season there is great plenty of Pasture for Cattel.

The Coast of this Province is very safe, and as well furnish’d with
variety of bold and pleasant Harbors, as any other part of _New-found
Land_; where the _English_ likewise Fish for Cod, the lesser sort
whereof is call’d _Poor-John_, which is there caught in great abundance,
especially at _Ferryland_, and in the _Bay of Bulls_. Besides these two
there are divers other excellent Harbors on the Eastern Shore of
_Avalon_, as _Capling Bay_, _Cape Broyle_, _Brittus_, _Isle of Spears_,
_Barrom Cove_, _Whitburns Bay_, and _Petit Harbour_ above mention’d. On
the West are the Bay of _Placentia_, and several other good Harbors.

There are no _Indians_ in _Avalon_, and but few _English_, by reason of
the excessive Cold in Winter, though Sir _David Kirk_ and his Lady, and
also his Family, liv’d in the Lord _Baltemore_’s House at _Ferryland_
for the space of ten years and upwards.

The Soil seems to promise great store of Mines, which probably may in
time be discover’d. The late Lord _Baltemore_ took accidentally a piece
of Oar up that lay there upon the surface of the Earth, and brought it
with him into _England_, which was found upon trial to yield a greater
proportion of Silver, than the Oar of _Potosi_ in the _West-Indies_, but
hitherto no Mine of it hath been discover’d there.

The Trade of Fishing being of so great concernment to the Nation of
_England_, the same (if it be well manag’d in this Island of _Terra
Nova_) will employ every year above two hundred Sail of _English_ Ships,
and ten thousand Mariners, besides the great benefit which may accrue
unto the Nation by Imposition upon Strangers there, which would amount
to several thousands of Pounds _per Annum_; with which those Coasts may
be Guarded, and Ships Trading thither secur’d: besides the great Customs
by the Ships call’d _The Sacks_ (being commonly in great numbers every
year) who carry Fish from _New-found Land_ into the _Straights_,
_France_, _Portugal_, and _Spain_, and who bring their Returns into
_England_, as Bullion, and all other native Commodities of those
Countreys.

If the Island were well fortifi’d, we might Command all those of other
Nations that come to Fish in _New-found Land_, to pay Contribution in
Fish or otherwise, for their Priviledge to Fish there, the said Island
being first Planted by _English_, and pertaining to the Kingdom of
_England_; or if occasion should require, they might be utterly debarr’d
of Fishing there.

The Trade of Fishing is of so great concernment to _France_, _Spain_,
_Portugal_, the _Straights_, and other Parts, that they cannot well be
without that yearly Supply in Fish which comes from that Island: Neither
can the _Hollanders_, _Spaniards_, or _Portuguese_, well set any Ships
to the _West-Indies_, without _New-found Land_ Fish, there being none
that will endure to pass the Line sound and untainted, but the Fish of
that Countrey, salted and dry’d there. And so long as the Act continues
still in force, That no Fish be Transported from the said Island, but in
_English_ Bottoms, it will contribute very much to our encrease of
Shipping there, and by consequence, of the employment of Mariners; and
the Fishing of that part of the Island will be solely appropriated to
the _English_ Nation, to whom of right it belongs, which will prove the
greatest Ballance of Trade in that part of the World; and that whereas
above two hundred Sail do Trade thither yearly to Fish, if a thousand
Sail come, if there be but Fisher-men enow, they may all have Fraughtage
there.

The _French_, if once the Island be fortifi’d, will be depriv’d of their
Nursery of Mariners, this being the onely place, besides _Canada_, and
one or two adjacent Coasts, where they come for supply of Fish, with
which that Nation cannot be furnish’d so well from other Parts.

By well Planting and Fortifying _New-found Land_, the Trading to
_Virginia_, _New England_, and those Parts, would be much encourag’d,
_New England_ having had of late great Traffick with _New-found Land_,
where they vend the Growth of their Plantation. Besides, _New-found
Land_ is a Key to the Gulf of _Canada_, which if the _English_ had again
in their possession, as they had in the Years 1628. and 1632. they might
give a Law to all foreign Kings and People interested in any of the
parts of _America_, and a Protection to all the _English_ Plantations
upon that Continent, whereby great security, comfort and profit would
arise to the Nation and People of it: whereas on the contrary, if the
_French_, _Spanish_, or _Dutch_, should possess themselves of the said
Plantation, they would not onely deprive this Nation of all the
Advantages aforesaid, but would also derive to themselves so great a
Power to prejudice all the Plantations of the Coasts of _America_
belonging to this Nation, that the Inconveniences thereof are scarce to
be imagin’d or express’d.

[Illustration: mappa ÆSTIVARVM Infularum]

After the granting of the Patent aforesaid of 13 _Car._ 1. Sir _David
Kirk_’s great Pains there, and constant Endeavours, were beyond
expectation bless’d with a continuance and preservation of Trade in that
Place; in the carrying on of which, he had always a special regard to
the real Advantage of this Kingdom, and the particular Service of His
Majesty.

[Sidenote: The wonderful Bank of _Terra Nova_.]

[Sidenote: _The Baccaloos._]

Before this Island, right over against _Cape Ray_, at the distance of
twenty four Leagues or more, there lieth an huge Bank or Ridge of Land,
extending it self in length out of the Sea, above a hundred Leagues, but
in breadth not above four or five and twenty, when it is broadest, and
in other parts much less, sharpning towards each end into a _Conus_, or
narrow Point. It is accounted one of the Wonders of the Sea, which round
about, at some distance, is very deep, and hardly to be sounded,
especially betwixt the _Bank_ (for so they commonly call it) and _Cape
Ray_, but drawing nearer, it grows by degrees more and more shallow,
insomuch that nigh the Land there is not much more Water than is
necessary for the Ships to Ride in. It runneth out in length, as was
said, from North to South, from forty one Degrees of Latitude to fifty
two; and round about it there lie scatter’d a multitude of lesser
Islands, which Sir _Sebastian Cabot_, when he first discover’d the
Place, call’d by one common Name _Los Baccaloos_, or _The Islands of
Cod-fish_, from the great quantity of that sort of Fish he there found;
which was such, that they hindred the passage of his Ships, and lay in
such multitudes upon the Coasts, that the very Bears would come and
catch them in their Claws, and draw them to Land.


[Sidenote: The Isle of _Assumption_.]

In the Gulf of _St. Laurence_, towards the Mouth of the River _Canada_,
is another less considerable Island, said to have been first discover’d
by _Quartier_, and by him call’d _The Island of Assumption_; by _John
Alphonso_, _The Island of Ascension_; by the Natives, _Natistcotec_: It
extends it self from the forty eighth to the fiftieth Degree, between
the South-East and North-West.

_Quartier_ makes mention of a strange kinde of Fish, found in the River
of _Canada_, like unto a Sea-Hog, but having the Head of a Hare, it is
call’d by the Natives _Adhothuys_.

Not far from this is a little Island, call’d by the _French_, _Isle de
Sable_, or _The Sandy Island_; and another on the West of _Terra Nova_,
call’d _Isle de Bretons_, or _The Island of St. Laurence_, besides
several little scatter’d Islands in the Gulf of _St. Laurence_, as
_Menego_, and _The Three Islands of Birds_; in which are found a kind of
amphibious Animal, call’d by the _French_, _Cualrus_, and by the
_Russians_, _Morsh_; somewhat like a Sea-Calf, but more monstrous.

                               CHAP. XII.
                    The Bermudas, or Summer-Islands.


[Sidenote: Situation of the _Bermudas_.]

The _Bermudas_, or _Summer-Islands_ (probably so term’d as to the first
Appellation from certain black Hogs, by the _Spaniards_ call’d
_Bermudas_, which from a Ship bound with them to some other parts of the
_West-Indies_, and cast away upon that Coast, swam ashore, and there
increased; or, as others say, from _John Bermudes_, a _Spaniard_, who is
said to have been the first Discoverer; or, as to the second, from one
_George Summers_, an _English_-man, who there suffer’d shipwrack) are
situated in thirty two Degrees and twenty five Minutes of Northern
Latitude about sixteen hundred Leagues from _England_, twelve hundred
from _Madera_, four hundred from _Hispaniola_, and three hundred from
the nearest Coast of _Virginia_. The first that endeavour’d to settle
Plantations here was a _Spaniard_ nam’d _Hernando Camelo_, being
design’d Conductor in this Expedition: And this Undertaking was so much
the more eagerly prosecuted, upon consideration that the Plate-Fleet
Sailing from _Havana_ through the _Straights_ of _Bahama_, might here
have a convenient Harbour; but those who were invited to become
Adventurers, with proffers of great Advantage, shewing themselves very
slack in the Business, and _Charles_ the Fifth being at that time
intangled in War and other troublesom Affairs, the Design came to
nothing, and for above sixty years after no farther Attempt was made by
any for the Planting of these Islands, till at last the _French_ made a
Voyage thither under Captain _Barboriere_, but by Shipwrack were
frustrated of their hopes; nor made they any more Preparations in this
Design. In which nevertheless the _English_ were not so easily
discourag’d, for first Captain _Gosnol_ and _Smith_ set forth, at the
Charges of Mr. _Edward Wingfield_; next, Captain _Nelson_; then
successively _West_, _Gates_, _Argal_, and _Wyat_, but all with little
or no success, till at length in the Year 1612. a Company was
establish’d in _London_ by the King’s Letters Patents, who sent one Mr.
_Richard Moor_ with sixty Men to the _Bermudas_, where he spent three
years in fortifying those Islands: but that which put a little stop to
this good beginning, was a kind of Misfortune that hapned; for the Rats
which were gotten ashore from a Shipwrack increas’d so exceedingly, that
they devour’d all the Plants in the Field, and the Provision in the
Houses, insomuch that a great Famine proceeded from thence, all means to
destroy the Vermine being in vain; till at last Providence sent a
Disease amongst them, which kill’d them all in a very short time. Mean
while _Moor_ went on in the fortification of the Island, and was ere
long supply’d with fresh People. Mr. _Barlet_ was sent over with sixty
Men, and carried from thence with him eighty Pound of Ambergreece. And
soon after three Ships more, _viz._ the _Blessing_, the _Star_, and the
_Margaret_, convey’d thither four hundred and ten, Men and Women. As
soon as _Moor_ was call’d away, _Daniel Tuckard_ coming from _Virginia_
to succeed him, bestirr’d himself very much, Planting all places full of
Trees fetch’d from the _West-Indian_ Islands; as also Tobacco, with
which he fraighted a Ship to _London_. Moreover, the Countrey was
divided into Acres, that every Planter might have an equal share, and
know his own Lands. _Anno 1619._ _Tuckard_ was succceded by _Nathaniel
Butler_, who in four Ships brought thither five hundred Men and Women,
to supply the first Plantation, which was much decay’d since the Rats
had devour’d their Provisions, so that it was little look’d after by the
Company in _London_: But now they built a Church and erected a Court of
Judicature, and all things were order’d conveniently for the publick
good. After which many Noble Persons set Sail thither in the _Magazine_
Frigat; and the Planters being now fifteen hundred in number, inhabited
twenty Leagues of Land in length.

[Sidenote: Forts built upon the _Bermudas_.]

On the longest Island, call’d _St. George_, (for the _Bermudas_ consists
of several Islands, great and small) they built _Warwick_ and _Dover_
Forts, with other Fortifications and Towers, which had their
Denominations from those Noble-men and Gentlemen that were Undertakers
in this Plantation, as _Cavendish_, _Paget_, _Herbert_, &c. from the
Earl of _Devonshire_, the Lord _Paget_, the Earl of _Pembroke_ and
others.

[Sidenote: Ports and Havens.]

Amongst the Havens the eminentest are, _Southampton_, the Inlet
_Harrington_, and the _Great Sound_.

All these Islands lying together resemble a Half-Moon, and are
surrounded with Rocks, which appear at Low-water, and at High lie but
shallow; for it seldom Ebbs or Flows above five Foot. The Shore, for the
most part Rocky, and hardned by the Sun and Wind, receives no damage by
the Waves which continually beat against the same.

[Sidenote: Nature of the Soil.]

The Ground it self differs; for in some places it is sandy or clayie,
and in others partly black, and partly white, or Ash-colour’d Earth;
which last is accounted the worst, and the black the best. Three Foot
deep under the Ash-colour’d Earth lie great Slates, and under the black,
a white spungie Stone, like the Pumice, in whose moist Crevises Trees
take root.

The Pits or Wells, though they Ebb and Flow with the Sea, yet produce a
wholsom and sweet Water.

[Sidenote: Temperature of the Air.]

The Skie is generally serene, but when over-cast with Clouds, is subject
to Lightning and Thunder; yet the Air is of a good temper, being neither
exceeding cold, nor excessive hot: for which reason the _European_
Fruits grow better there than in their natural Soil.

Their Harvest is twice a year; for that which they Sowe in _March_, is
ripe and gather’d in _June_; then what they Sowe again in _August_, they
gather in _January_.

[Sidenote: Productions of the Countrey.]

These Islands breed no hurtful Creatures; nay, the yellow Spider which
spins silken Cobwebs, is free from Poyson.

The Plant _Nuchtly_, which bears speckled Pears, grows betwixt the Rocks
which are drench’d with Sea-water.

The Hogs which above a hundred and fifty years since swam ashore out of
the _Spanish_ Wrack, are exceedingly increas’d there, but because of
their poorness are scarce eatable, they feeding onely on the sweet
Berries which fall from the _Palmito_-Trees.

About the white and red Mulberries, which grow plentifully there, breed
thousands of Silk-worms, which spin Silk according to the colour of the
Mulberries.

The Sea produces some quantity of Pearls and Ambergreece.

From the beginning of the year till _May_, the Whales are seen to swim
not far from the Shore.

A strange sort of Sea-Fowl breed in Holes like Rabbets; and amongst
other Birds, here are also store of Cranes.

The Tobacco which the _English_ have planted here grows very well.

[Sidenote: Tortoises Laying of Eggs.]

Here are likewise great Tortoises, which Lay their Eggs in the Sand on
the Shore, where they are Hatch’d by the Beams of the Sun, and are taken
after this manner: In the Night some are set to watch where they Land,
and whilest they are digging a deep Hole in the Ground, are thrown on
their Backs, and not being able to get upon their Legs again, they lie
and groan very pitifully: some of them having above two Basons full of
Eggs in their Bellies; which being about the bigness of a Tennis-Ball,
have a thin Shell, which incloseth a Yolk and White. If these Eggs lie
buried six years, then the young Tortoises breaking the Shell, come out
of the Sand, and instantly creep into the Sea. Their Flesh is not onely
wholsom but toothsom. The Oyl made of them is not inferior to Butter.

[Sidenote: Cedars of an excellent kind.]

Moreover, the _Bermudas_ produce Cedars, the like of which are not to be
found in the whole World: The Leaves are douny and prickly at the ends,
almost like those of the Juniper Tree: The Wood hath a sweet smell, and
the Berries, which are like the Myrtle, of a pale Red, inclose four
white Kernels; the outermost Skin whereof is sweet; the innermost, which
covers the Kernel, sharp, and the Pulp tartish: The Trees are always
flourishing, being at the same time full of Blossoms, green, and ripe
Fruit: The Berries, when grown ripe, begin to gape, and fall off in
rainy Weather, leaving a round Stalk on the Boughs, which loses not its
Rind till two years after; half which time the Berry requires, before it
attains to its perfect ripeness, which generally happens in the Winter:
The Boughs shoot straight upwards, and become in time so heavy, that
they cause the Body of the Tree to bend. This most excellent Wood grows
in divers places of the _Bermudas_.

We shall conclude with the resolute Exploit of five Sea-men, _Anno
1616._ who, to the great admiration of all People, set Sail from thence
in an open Vessel of three Tun through the main Ocean, and after having
suffer’d terrible Tempests, arriv’d in the space of seven Weeks safe in
_Ireland_.

These Islands are remarkable for divers sorts of Plants, unknown in
other Parts, as the _Prickle Pear_, _Poyson Weed_, _Red Weed_, _Purging
Bean_, _Costive Tree_, _Red Pepper_, and the _Sea Feather_. Also several
strange Birds, as the _Egg Bird_, _Cahow_, _Tropick Bird_, and the
_Pemlico_, which presageth Storms.

                              Hispaniola.


The Islands call’d _De Barlovento_, by which are understood
_Hispaniola_, _Cuba_, _Jamaica_, and _Boriquen_, as also the _Lucaies_,
with the _Caribes_, and lastly the Isles call’d _De Sotavento_, viz.
_Margareta_, _Cabagua_, and _Tabago_, are by some comprehended all under
the general Name of _The Isles Antilles_; though others reckon the
_Antilles_ to be the same with the _Caribes_ onely. But leaving this
Controversie undecided, we shall begin with the Isles _De Barlovento_,
the chief whereof is _Hispaniola_.

[Sidenote: Bounds and Description of _Hispaniola_.]

_Hispaniola_, or _Little Spain_ (as _Columbus_ nam’d it) is, though not
the largest, yet the fairest and goodliest of all the _American_
Islands, call’d by the Natives anciently _Hayti_ and _Quisqueia_: It
lieth about fifteen Leagues Westward of _Porto Rico_, and distant from
the main Land of _America_ about one hundred and twenty; ’tis of a
triangular form, the sharpest Point whereof is that towards _Porto
Rico_, which they call _Cabo de Enganno_: that towards the West inclines
to a Semi-circle, containing a good and convenient Bay betwixt the two
Points, _viz._ _St. Nicholas_ to the North, and _Cabo de Donna Maria_
towards the South. It is not thought to be less than a hundred and fifty
Leagues in length, and in breadth from threescore to thirty, and to
contain in the compass of the whole, four hundred Leagues at least,
lying betwixt eighteen and twenty Degrees of Northern Latitude, having
an Air somewhat infested with the Morning Heats, but well cool’d again
in the Afternoon, by a constant Wind from the Sea, which they call there
_Virason_. It is, for the fertility of the Soil, one of the richest and
most flourishing Countreys in the World; the Trees and all things else
there continually clad, as it were, in their Summer Livery, the Meadows
and Pastures always green, and of such an excellent Herbage, that Cattel
both breed and thrive there beyond belief; both great Cattel and small,
as Kine, Sheep, Hogs, _&c._ brought thither out of _Spain_, having
multiply’d to such numbers, that they live wild now in Herds in several
places, and are both hunted and kill’d, like Stags or other Venison,
onely for their Hides, which they send yearly into _Spain_ and other
parts of _Europe_, as a great Merchandize and Commodity of huge profit
to them.

[Illustration]

Wild Hogs also have been formerly seen to feed in the Woods in great
multitudes, but the Dogs since they were brought over hither, have made
great havock amongst them.

[Sidenote: Beasts peculiar to _Hispaniola_.]

The Animals peculiar to this Island are 1. A little Beast call’d
_Hutias_, not much unlike our Coneys. 2. _Chemi_, almost of the same
form, but a little bigger. 3. _Mohui_, A Beast somewhat less than the
_Hutias_. 4. A Beast call’d _Coxi_.

[Sidenote: The Fly _Cuyero_.]

Likewise amongst other strange sorts of Creatures here, the _Cuyero_ is
very observable, being about an Inch big, and having four Wings, of
which two are larger than the other: when they flie they shine after
such a manner, that in the Night they make a Room as light as day,
insomuch that some have made use of them in stead of Candles to Read by.

[Sidenote: The Fish _Manate_.]

No less wonderful is the Fish _Manate_, whose shape hath been describ’d
elsewhere: It breeds for the most part in the Sea, yet sometimes
swimming up the Rivers, comes ashore and eats Grass. The Casique
_Caramatexi_ kept one in the Lake _Guaynato_, which was so tame, that
when call’d by the Name _Maton_, it us’d to come out of the Water, and
go directly to the _Casique_’s House, where being fed, it return’d to
the Lake, accompanied with Men and Boys, who with their Singing seem’d
to delight the Fish, which sometimes carried ten Children on its Back
over the Water; but at last a _Spaniard_ striking at it with a Pike, it
would never come forth again when it espy’d a Cloth’d Man: It liv’d
twenty six years in the fore-mention’d Lake, till by accident the River
_Hayboaic_ over-flowing into the said Lake, the Fish return’d to the
Sea.

[Sidenote: The Fish _Abacatuaia_.]

Besides this great Fish, here is also a sort of small Fish, call’d
_Abacatuaia_, with a little Mouth, black Eyes encompass’d with
Silver-colour’d Circles, four black Fins, two long ones under its Belly,
one on the Back, and one on each side of the Head, the Tail slit and
cover’d with a glittering Skin: It is as big as a Flounder, and not ill
Meat, but thick and round.

[Sidenote: The Insect _Nigua_.]

When the _Spaniards_ first setled on _Hispaniola_, they were exceedingly
tormented with a sort of leaping Insects call’d _Nigua_, which us’d to
eat through their Skin into the Flesh in such a nature, that many of
them lost their Arms and Legs; but at last they found out a Remedy
against this Evil, _viz._ the searing the Wounds with hot Irons.

[Sidenote: Fruits.]

Besides the aforesaid plenty of Flesh, they have many excellent Fruits
all the year long, as Banana’s, Pine-Apples, Custud-Apples, Plantens,
Papans, Musk-melons, Water-melons, and many other peculiar Plants, as 1.
the _Auzuba_, a fair large Tree, the Fruit whereof is call’d _Pinnas_,
resembling a _Malecotoon_: Of this Tree there are three sorts, _Jaima_,
_Boniama_, and _Jaiqua_; 2. _Quauconex_; 3. _Axi_; of which there are
also several sorts, as _Carive_, _Huarahuac_, _Axiblanco_,
_Acafran-Axi_, and _Axi-Coral_; 4. _Yuca_, the Root of which serves in
stead of Corn; 5. Certain Trees call’d _Guaibes_, besides plenty of Mint
and Potato’s.

[Sidenote: The Provinces of this Island.]

The Island of _Hispaniola_ was formerly divided into several Provinces,
amongst which the Mountainous Countrey _Hyguey_ lies towards the Isle of
_Porto Rico_. On the Mountains, which are flat on the top, are great
variety of sharp-pointed Stones. The Soil is a sort of colour’d Earth,
which produces all sorts of Fruit, especially the Root _Casabi_, and
Melons.

_Hyguey_ also conterminates with _Ycayagua_; Northward lies _Samana_;
Southward, _Yaquimo_, where there is store of _Brasile_ Wood: And
between the City _Domingo_ and _Yaquimo_, is the Countrey _Baoruco_,
which with its Mountains extends sixty Leagues in length, and above
twenty in breadth, without any Water, Pasture, or Food for Cattel or
Mankind.

Next follows the Countrey _Xaragua_, lying at the great Inlet which
divides _Hispaniola_; for one side extends to the Promontory of _St.
Nicholas_, and the other to the Point _Tiburon_. This Countrey produces
abundance of Cotton.

Lastly, the Provinces _Guahaba_, _Haniguagya_ and _Cahay_, are very
eminent; as also _Cibao_, which is full of Gold-Mines; and _Lavega
Real_, with _Magnana_, which lie between the two great Rivers _Neyba_
and _Yagui_; the stony Countrey _Ciguayos_, and the low Coast _Darica_,
where _Christopher Columbus_ built the City _Navidad_, which he
afterwards deserted.

Ginger was formerly brought hither from the _East-Indies_, but now grows
here in such great abundance, that above two and twenty thousand
_Kintalls_ are yearly Transported from thence to _Spain_.

With as good success grow here also the Sugar-Canes and _Maiz_.

_Peter Martyr_, a Councellor to the Emperor _Charles_ the Fifth,
relates, That _Hispaniola_ produc’d in his time, besides Silver, Copper,
and Iron, five hundred thousand _Ducats_ in Gold: Nevertheless the rich
Mines lay undisturb’d, because they wanted People to work in them,
insomuch that had they not planted their Royal Seat in _Domingo_, the
Island had long since been deserted, notwithstanding the exceeding
fruitfulness of the Soil, because the _Spaniards_ exercis’d their
Cruelty in such a nature, that of sixty thousand Inhabitants from the
Year 1508. to _Anno 1514._ scarce fourteen thousand of them were left
alive; all which is affirm’d by the Bishop _De las Casas_. Nay, the
fore-mention’d _Peter Martyr_ relates, That the Men wearied with working
in the Mines, kill’d themselves, despairing of ever being releas’d from
their Slavery; and Women with Child destroy’d the Infants in their
Wombs, that they might not bear Slaves for the _Spaniards_. He adds
hereunto, That of a hundred and twenty thousand Persons, few were left
in a short time.

[Sidenote: The Gaiety of the antient _Casiques_.]

These Provinces in former times had each of them their _Casique_, whose
splendor consisted chiefly in Dancing to his Devotion, with a Girdle
full of Bells about his Middle, a String of Pearls about his Arms, a
Covering over his Privities, and a Plume of Feathers on his Head, with a
Drummer before him, and a small Train of Arm’d Men after him.

[Illustration]

[Sidenote: Ports and Havens.]

On the Coast are first the Point of _Nisao_, ten Leagues to the West of
_Santo Domingo_.

Eighteen Leagues farther is the Port _Ocoa_, which is a Bay where the
Fleets of _Nova Hispania_ take refreshing, when they do not Anchor in
the Nook of _Sepesepin_, which is near unto it, or in another call’d
_The Fair Haven_, two Leagues before you come to _Ocoa_.

Twenty Leagues beyond _Ocoa_ is the Port of _Asua_.

Thirty Leagues more Westwardly is a large Point right against the Island
of _Bola_, which lieth five Leagues from the Coast.

The most Westerly Point is call’d _Cape Tiburon_: It hath an Island
three Leagues from it Westward, call’d _Caprio_; and Sailing along the
Coast, you will see an Island call’d _Camito_, and farther in the Nook
of _Yaguana_ another call’d _Guanabo_ of eight Leagues long.

On the North side of the Island, the most Westerly Cape and Port is _St.
Nicholas_, from whence North-East and by East, lieth the Island of
_Tortuga_, near the Coast of _Hispaniola_: It is of five Leagues length.

Farther along the Coast is _Monte Christo_, the West Cape of
_Natividad_; to the East of which there is a great Bay call’d _Port
Real_.

This Island is so full of Harbours, that he that will Coast it, cannot
well miss of one where he pleaseth, most of which afford fresh Meat and
good Water.

Moreover, _Hispaniola_ hath many brave Rivers, the chiefest of which are
_Hayna_; _Nizao_, along whose Shore the first Sugar-Canes were planted;
_Neyba_, a great River; _Yaquimo_; _Yaqui_, which _Columbus_ call’d _Rio
de Oro_, because the Ground thereof glitter’d like Gold; and lastly, the
Rivers _Nicayagua_, amongst whose Sands is Gold; _Nigua_, which borrows
its Denomination from the fore-mention’d leaping Insect; the swift
Stream _Juno_, whose Banks are crown’d with handsom Houses; and
_Jaquin_, which hath many Salt-pans.

The Rivers _Itabo_, _Ocoa_, _Cepi_, _Bia_, _Cazui_, _Sanate de Plata_,
and _Chiabon_, have some one, others more Sugar-Mills upon them.

But the chiefest River is _Ozama_, broad, and so deep, that the biggest
Vessel may lie close by the Shore; and also washes _St. Domingo_.

[Sidenote: Description of the City of _St. Domingo_.]

This City, the Metropolis of all the Isles round about, was built by
_Bartholomeus Columbus_, and was peopled _Anno 1494._ after which it
flourish’d eight years, when, a terrible Storm blowing the same down to
the Ground, _Nicholas Olanda_ remov’d it to the Western Shore of
_Ozama_, that the _Spaniards_, who had for the most part setled towards
the West, might not be necessitated to Ferry over: but the first place
stood much more conveniently, being not onely provided of a Fountain of
sweet Water, but also freed of those unwholsom Vapours which daily rise
with the Sun at this new-built City. To prevent the inconvenience of
crossing to the foremention’d Fountain, of which the Inhabitants found
themselves oftentimes in great want, _Olanda_ went about to lead the
neighboring River _Hayna_ into the _Ozama_, but the Design not being
prosecuted, bereav’d _Domingo_ of the onely thing which would have made
it able to stand in competition with any City in the World; for it lies
on a Plain, the South side whereof is wash’d by the Sea; the East side,
by the River; on the North and West are many delightful Fields.

The City, which in a manner is built square, is divided into long
straight Streets, full of fair Houses after the _Spanish_ manner: in the
middle thereof is a square Market-place, with a handsom Church, the Yard
whereof is encompass’d with a high Wall, which upon occasion would serve
for a place of great Defence.

The Collectors of the King of _Spain_’s Revenue dwell in stately
Palaces; and the _Dominicans_, _Franciscans_, and Monks _De la Merced_,
have brave Cloysters, besides two more for the Nuns.

The _Latine_ School and Hospital belonging to the City, are Endow’d with
great yearly Revenues.

The Arch-bishop of _St. Domingo_ hath Command over the Bishoprick of
_Conception_, _La Vega_, _Cuba_, _Venezuela_, and _Porto Rico_.

The City is surrounded with a Stone Wall, and fortifi’d with a Castle,
which with two Bulwarks reaches to the River _Ozama_, and within them
two Half-Moons.

On the utmost Shore stands a round Tower near the Southern Bulwark.

Before the new discover’d Countreys entic’d away many People from _St.
Domingo_, and the Silver Fleet put into _Havana_, the Inhabitants drove
a great Trade in Hides, Tallow, Sugar, _Cassia_, Horses, and Hogs.

_Anno 1586._ Sir _Francis Drake_ Landed here with twelve hundred
_English_-men, took the City by Storm, staid a whole Moneth in the same,
and upon Composition with the _Spaniard_, left it undestroy’d.

[Sidenote: Other chief Towns of _Hispaniola_.]

Other chief Towns in _Hispaniola_ are 1. _Salvaleon_, twenty eight
Leagues distant from _St. Domingo_, towards the East.

2. _Zeybo._ 3. _Cotny_, formerly inhabited by those that work’d in the
Gold-Mines; the last especially was once a rich Town, and much
frequented, but now in a manner deserted.

4. _Azua_, or _New Compostella_, eight Leagues distant from _St.
Domingo_, famous for the Sugar-Mills not far from it, and one of the
Ports before-mention’d.

5. _Yaguana_, for its brave Harbour also call’d _Maria del Puerto_, in
the more Western parts of the Island; a small Town not above a League
distant from the Sea; It was burnt by Captain _Christopher Newport_.

[Illustration: URBA DOMINGO IN HISPANIOLA]

6. _Conception de la Vega_, adorn’d with a Cathedral and Cloysters of
Fryers, and lying twenty or thirty Leagues Northward of _St. Domingo_:
It was built by _Columbus_, and from thence he had his Title of _Duke de
la Vega_.

7. _Sant Jago de los Cavalleros_, a very pleasant Place, ten Leagues
Northward of _St. Domingo_.

8. _Puerto de Plata_, or _The Silver Haven_, four Leagues distant from
_St. Domingo_ towards the North: It hath been counted the second Place
of Trading and Wealth in the whole Island, being commodiously seated on
an Arm of the Sea, and fortifi’d with a Castle.

9. _Monte Christo_, one of the Ports also above-mention’d: It lies
fourteen Leagues Westward of _Plata_, and extends it self along the
Northern Coast: it is wash’d by the River _Yagui_, on whose Banks are
many Salt-pans.

[Sidenote: The Island dispeopled by the cruelty of the _Spaniards_.]

[Sidenote: Their barbarous usage of _Guaccanarillo_ and others.]

All those Cities are much decay’d, and thinly inhabited, the _Spaniards_
being most of them drawn by the temptation of new discover’d Gold and
Silver Mines in other places, and the first Inhabitants having been
miserably destroy’d. The Bishop _De las Casas_, an Eye-witness, relates,
That the King _Gauccanarillo_ secur’d the Goods of a stranded Ship, of
which _Columbus_ was Commander, and receiv’d the _Spaniards_ very
courteously; but not being able to continue supplying them with that
quantity of Gold they requir’d, wanting Men to gather so much out of the
Streams and Mines, and seeing no way to rid himself from the _Spaniards_
Oppressions, fled to the Province of _Ciguayos_, the _Casique_ of which
was his Deputy; whereat the _Spaniards_ were so enrag’d, that they burnt
all that they could meet with, neither sparing young nor old; and at
length taking _Guaccanarillo_, put him in Irons, and thought to have
carried him to _Madrid_; but the Ship in which he went suffering
Shipwrack, he with many others was cast away, being before almost dead
with grief for his Consort, who had been Ravish’d by a _Spanish_
Commander, Likewise _Anacoana_, Sister to the _Casique_, or Governor of
the Province _Xarana_, and Partner with him in the Government, seeing
three hundred of her Councellors burning in a great House, set on fire
by the _Spaniards_, and her Subjects torn by Dogs, or cut in pieces,
hung her self out of despair. The same Death died _Higuanama_, Queen of
_Huguey_. Others say that _Anacoana_ was put to death together with her
Brother in a most barbarous and cruel manner, by _Nicholas de Olanda_,
who succeeded _Diego de Arana_ in the Government of this Island. Many
Women and Children were kept alive onely to Manure the Ground. The Men
dying of their hard Labour in the Gold-Mines, and those which endur’d
stoutly the cruel Labour under Ground, were never suffer’d to go to
their Wives; from whence proceeded a great decrease of People, the
_Spaniards_ seeming purposely to design the destruction of the Natives
of _Hispaniola_, though they receiv’d great benefit by their Service;
for Gold in former times was found between the Cracks and split Stones
of the Mountains, whose Veins the Mine-workers digg’d for not without
great and dangerous Labour.

[Sidenote: First original of the People of _Hispaniola_.]

The first Planters of _Hispaniola_ are, according to the common opinion,
deriv’d from _Matinio_, a high and Mountainous Isle, from whence the
most eminent Inhabitants were driven by certain Rebels, as formerly the
_Syrians_ under the Government of _Dido_, were driven from _Tyre_ to
_Lybia_, and the _Batavians_ from _Hessen_ to the Countrey between
_Rhyne_ and _Wall_, at present inhabited by the _Gelders_ and
_Hollanders_. These _Matininoensians_ thus expell’d from their native
Countrey, setled themselves on _Cahonao_, near the River _Bahaboni_: The
first House they call’d _Camoteia_, and afterwards turn’d it into a
Temple, to which they shew’d Reverence, and made great Presents: In like
manner the _Tyema_, which stood on a high Rock belonging to one of the
_Canary_ Islands, was by the ancient Inhabitants of the Place had in
great veneration, insomuch that many leap’d down from the same, being
perswaded by the Priests, That the Souls of those which threw themselves
off this sacred Break-neck, should immediately be translated into a
place of everlasting happiness.

[Sidenote: The ancient Name of this Island.]

This Island was, as we said before, first call’d _Haity_ which signifies
_Wild_, because in many places it swells with wondrous high Mountains,
and in other places is over-grown with great Woods: it was afterwards by
the ancient Inhabitants nam’d _Xusqueia_, that is, _Unmeasurably great_,
because they suppos’d it to be the whole World, and that the Sun shin’d
in no other place.

[Sidenote: _Indian_ Songs or Ballads call’d _Areitos_.]

The Natives of this Island, though wholly rude of acquir’d Knowledge or
Literature, like the generality of the _Americans_, yet they took care
to instruct their Children in the Original and Antiquities of their
Countrey, and the Wars and Exploits of their Predecessors, both which
they contain’d in Songs call’d _Areitos_ which they us’d to Sing to the
sound of Drums and Trumpets; but especially their Persons of chiefest
Quality study’d most these _Areitos_, and exercis’d themselves in
Dancing.

[Sidenote: Strange Prediction of the _Spaniards_ Arrival.]

The most remarkable of these ancient _Areitos_, were such as pretended
to prophesie of things to come, which if of sad consequence, were Sung
very mournfully and with many Sighs; nor were they always, however
inspir’d, without effect, as appear’d at last by woful event: for long
before the _Spaniards_ Landed on _Hispaniola_, it was foretold by one of
them, that _Maguacochios_, signifying _Clothed People_, should Land on
_Hispaniola_, who with sharp Weapons should cut off Heads and Arms, and
under whose insupportable Yoke their Successors must spend their days
without hope of ever being releas’d.

It might be disputed whether these Predictions were dictated by good or
evil Spirits; but it is generally believ’d, that all their Oracles,
whether hapning true or false, were suggested by diabolical Spirits to
the Priests, who commonly convers’d with them; and that these Spirits
knew the Design of several People to discover new Countreys.

[Sidenote: The Images of their _Zemes_.]

Their Images _Zemes_, stuff’d full of Cotton, were fashion’d into very
frightful Shapes, and might pass for those things which we call
_Terricula_, or _Bugbears_; of which some were made very small, and
those they ty’d on their Foreheads when they went to the Wars. Every
Governor had a peculiar _Zemes_, to whom he shew’d Reverence, in return
whereof he expected Rain, fair Weather, and to conquer his Enemies,
supposing him to be a Messenger of a perpetual and endless Being, by
them call’d _Jocauna Guamaonocon_; whom nevertheless they suppos’d to
have a Mother, to whom they gave five Names, _viz._ _Attbeir_, _Mamona_,
_Guacarapita_, _Liella_, and _Guimazoa_.

[Sidenote: The Islanders Opinion of the Creation.]

Their opinion of Man’s Creation was thus: They say, that out from a
Mountain in the Province _Cuanana_, out of certain small and great
Caverns therein, came little and great People: The biggest Hole, call’d
_Cazibaragua_, and the little one, nam’d _Amaiauna_, were said to be
lock’d up every Night, that none might pass the Sentinel _Machchael_,
who out of curiosity leaving the Mountain _Cuata_, and going up into the
Countrey, was discover’d by the Sun, whose Beams he not being able to
endure, was turn’d into a Rock. The like Mischance hapned to many
others, who in the dark Night going to Fish, in the Morning at their
Return were chang’d into Oaken Trees, onely one of the Fishermen was
sent away by the chief Commander _Vaguoniana_, who moved at the
Complaint of a Nightingale’s Singing, suffer’d all the Men to go into
the Hole, and the Women and Children he Transported to _Matinino_. But
to make short of these non-sensical Stories, in conclusion, the Men
being let out of their Caves, saw many strange Beasts amongst the Woods,
which being turn’d into Women, were entertain’d by them, and brought
forth a numerous Progeny, which spread over all _Hispaniola_.

[Sidenote: Their foolish Opinion of the Original of the Sea.]

No less ridiculous an Account do the Priests give concerning the
Original of the Sea, _viz._ That _Jaia_, a mighty Man, buried the Body
of his deceased Son in a Pumpion, which some Moneths after, out of meer
affection to the Deceased, he cutting open, abundance of Whales sprung
out of it. This Wonder being every where known, amongst others, entic’d
four Brothers born at one Birth (whose Mother died in Childbed) to get
the Pumpion into their possession; which their Design prov’d successful:
but afterwards struck with a pannick fear of _Jaia_’s coming thither
(who oftentimes came to mourn over the Bones of his dead Son) they fled,
and threw away the Pumpion, which breaking with the fall, the Sea gush’d
out of all places thereof, and cover’d the Plains in such a manner, that
nothing of them was seen, onely the tops of the highest Mountains
appear’d; at which the four Brothers terribly afrighted, rang’d through
barren Desarts, in which they had died of Hunger, had they not come to a
Baker’s House, which one of them entring, ask’d for _Cazabi_; but the
Baker denying them Bread, spit on them, which caus’d a mortal Dropsie,
which the Brothers upon consultation found no way to cure, but by
cutting a hole in the Skin with a sharp Stone, and to let out the Water;
but out of each running Wound sprung a Woman, who bare them four Sons
and four Daughters.

[Sidenote: The Cave _Jovana-beina_.]

There is a certain Cave call’d _Jovana-beina_, which is adorn’d with a
thousand Pictures, in great esteem amongst them; at the Entrance on each
side whereof stands a _Zemes_; that on the right side is call’d
_Binthaitelles_, the other _Marohur_, to which they come from all places
to pay their Devotions, because (they say) the Sun and Moon came out of
the said Cave to lighten the World.

[Sidenote: Their absurd Opinion of the Deceased.]

Much after the same absurd rate is their Opinion of the Deceased; for
they suppose that they range through Woods and Forrests in the Night,
eat of a Fruit call’d _Guannaba_, and steal to the Embraces of Women in
Moon-shiny Nights. A Traveller, say they, if he be frighted at the
appearance of a deceased Person, great inconveniences will certainly
attend him, but if he goes stoutly towards it, then the Goblin vanishes.

These Delusions are made great Mysteries amongst them, and contain’d in
Songs, which their Priests _Boiti_ Sing to a kind of Tabor made of a
piece of hollow Wood, pretending that they have familiar Conversation
with the _Zemes_ concerning future things.

[Sidenote: Their Ceremonies about their Sick.]

Their Ceremonies about their sick, especially if Persons of Quality, are
likewise very remarkably odd and conceited: First they chew a strong
kind of Herb, call’d _Cohobba_, with which having sufficiently
intoxicated their Brains, they foam at the Mouth, and run with a Stone
and a piece of Flesh in their Mouths to the sick Person, whose Family
they drive all out of Doors, except one or two, whose presence the
Patient requires; then the _Boiti_ walks four times about the sick
Person’s Bed, making strange Gestures, pinching his Lips and Nose,
blowing upon his Forehead, Throat and Temples, and sucking several parts
of his Body, alledging, that thereby he draws the Distemper out of the
Veins; after that he chafes and rubs his Shoulders, Thighs and Legs, and
ties his Hands and Feet together, then running to the Door, proclaims,
That the Sick in a short time shall be restor’d to his former Health;
which said, he returns with his Arms stretch’d out towards the sick
Person, takes the piece of Flesh out of his Mouth, which he gives him
backwards, saying, _You shall rise and go forth in Health, for I have
taken away your Sickness_: But if he judges the Distemper not curable,
he makes the Sick believe, that _Zemes_ is displeas’d with him, because
he did not build a House for him, or consecrate a Garden to him, or in
some respect or other did not worship him as he ought to have done. When
the Soul departs out of the Body, they conjure the Body with many
Adjurations, to reveal whether it died according to God’s decree, or
through neglect of the _Boiti_, as not having sanctifi’d himself enough
by Fasting when he went first to the Sick, or not prescrib’d sufficient
Medicines: wherefore if (as they say) the Devil answers them from the
Mouth of the Deceased, that the _Boiti_ did not perform his due Office,
then the nearest Friends revenge themselves on the _Boiti_, but if
otherwise, then they are highly esteem’d amongst them. The Women taking
the Stones which the _Boiti_ kept in his Mouth, wrap them up in a fine
Cloth as a holy Relique, supposing that they will much facilitate their
Child-birth.

[Sidenote: Their manner of Consulting with their _Zemes_.]

The _Casiques_ desirous to know future Events of War, or whether the
approaching Years will be fruitful, go into a Chappel consecrated to the
_Zemes_, and snuff the intoxicating Herb _Cohobba_ up their Nostrils;
whereupon they break out into loud Exclamations, and some kind of
strange extravagant Actions, till the power of the _Cohobba_ begins to
decay, and the Frenzie cease; then coming again to their Senses, they
bow their Heads, and lay their Elbows on their Knees, in which posture
they sit for a considerable time, then lifting up their Eyes they yawn
as if they came from sleep; then they mutter to themselves whilest their
Retinue which stand about them (for no common Person is suffer’d to be
there) thank them with a loud Voice, for the pains they have been at in
discoursing with the _Zemes_; then the _Casiques_ begin to declare what
hath been reveal’d to them, _viz._ whether they shall be fortunate in
the Wars or not; whether it will be a fruitful or unfruitful, healthy or
sickly Year.

[Sidenote: Gossipping.]

Moreover, at the Birth of the _Casique_’s Children, the neighboring
Governors visit the Women in Child-bed, and every one gives the Child a
peculiar Name, from whence it happens that one Man hath oftentimes forty
Names, and is highly incens’d if any one of them chances to be forgot in
any Writing directed to him.

[Sidenote: Manner of Succession.]

Their manner of Succession in Government is not unremarkable; for not
the eldest Heir-male of the Family, but first the King or _Casique_’s
Brother, if he have any, and after his Decease the eldest of the Sisters
Inherits the Realm or _Seigniorie_: if the Sisters have no Male-issue,
then the Brothers Sons Inherit; and in case they have no Male-heir, then
the next of Blood, whether Male or Female: but if the Prince or
_Casique_ dies without Children, Nephews, or other near Relations, the
next in Power in the Countrey Inherits, and Marries as many Wives as he
pleases; of which she that he loves best is burn’d alive in her best
Apparel with her Husband when he dies, and near the Corps stands a Cup
of Water and some of the Bread _Cazabi_.

[Sidenote: Languages.]

There are several Languages in _Hispaniola_, but differing from each
other: for in the Province _Bainoa_ they have a different, both
Pronunciation and Dialect from that in _Caizimu_.

In the said Province of _Caizimu_ is a very remarkable Rock, or vast
Stone to be seen, at the Foot of a high Mountain; and underneath the
said Stone is a great Cave, into which they go through a large Passage,
not unlike a Temple Door; near which conjoyn many deep Rivers, with such
a Noise and Foam, that they lose both their Sight and Hearing, whoever
approach the same.

[Sidenote: An Example of the _Bainoan_ Language.]

Of the Language of the Province _Bainoa_, _Peter Martyr_ gives us this
Specimen: “The Wife of a _Casique_ (says he) went to Prayers in a
Chappel which was built by the _Spaniards_; at her Return from whence
her Husband desiring to enjoy her, she refusing, said, _Teitoca,
teitoca, techeta Cynato guammechina_, that is to say, _Be contented, Be
contented, God would be highly incens’d_: to which the _Casique_
answer’d, _Gnaibba Cynato machabucha guamechyna_, that is, _What care I
if God be angry_.”

[Sidenote: The taking of _St. Domingo_ by Sir _Fran. Drake_.]

Since the _Spaniards_ had first possession of this Island, it hath been
twice Invaded by the _English_, the first time under the Conduct of Sir
_Francis Drake_, who took the Town of _San Domingo_, staid in it a good
while, and could if he had pleas’d, have totally dispossess’d the
_Spaniards_; the second time under Colonel _Venables_, sent thither by
_Oliver Cromwell_ during his usurp’d Dominion; at which time it might as
easily have been taken as at first, had not the Business been rashly and
indiscreetly manag’d, as shall presently be declar’d more at large. The
first Expedition of Sir _Francis Drake_ hath been already hinted, but
for the memorableness of that bold Exploit, we shall give a particular
Account of it from a late Writer, who hath set forth the Life of that
brave _English_ Heroe. In the Year of our Lord 1580. about the end of
_February_ setting Sail from _St. Christophers_ for _Hispaniola_, by the
Way they met with a small Frigat bound for _San Domingo_, and the Men of
her being Examin’d, one assur’d them that the Haven of it was a barr’d
Haven, and the Shore well fortifi’d, so that there was no convenient
Landing within ten _English_ Miles of the City, whither this Man
undertook to conduct them. _January_ the first they Landed ten Miles
from the City, and marching thither under the Command of the Lieutenant
General, arriv’d about one a Clock in the Afternoon; when they came
near, about a hundred and fifty Gentlemen well Mounted, presented
themselves against them; but the small Shot playing upon them, they
departed, and the _English_ proceeded towards the two Gates of the City
that lay towards the Sea, both which the _Spaniards_ had Mann’d, and
planted their Ordnance without the Gates, and some small Shot in an
Ambush by the Way-side: The _English_ being about twelve hundred Men,
divided themselves; the Lieutenant-General leading the one half to one
Gate, and Captain _Powel_ the other half to the other Gate, vowing that
with God’s assistance they would not rest till they met in the
Market-place: No sooner had the _Spaniards_ discharg’d their Ordnance,
doing some little Execution, but the Lieutenant-General hasted, or
rather ran upon them, to prevent their Charging again, and
notwithstanding their Ambush, entred Pell Mell with them into the Gate,
not staying till he came into the Market-place, unto whom shortly after
came Captain _Powel_ with his Companies. This Place they strengthned
with Barricado’s, the City being too large to be guarded by so small and
weary an Army. And after Mid-night they in the Castle, hearing some of
the _English_ busie about the Gate, quitted it, some being taken
Prisoners, and others escaping by Boats. The next day the _English_
enlarg’d their Quarters, and fortifi’d themselves, and held the Town for
a Moneths space. During this time the General sent a _Negro_ Boy with a
Flag of Truce to the _Spaniards_, who by the Way was met by some
Officers of the Galley which the _English_ had taken, together with the
City, who furiously thrust the poor Boy through the Body; who returning
to the General, and having declar’d how barbarously they had us’d him,
fell down and died in his Presence. The General being much mov’d
herewith, commanded the Provost-Martial to take two Fryers, and to carry
them to the same place with a sufficient Guard, and there to hang them;
and withal he sent one of the Prisoners to inform the _Spaniards_ why he
did it, and to tell them, that till the Party who had thus murder’d his
Messenger were deliver’d to him, there should no day pass wherein he
would not hang two Prisoners, till all were consum’d. Hereupon the day
following the Murtherer was brought, and an Offer made to deliver him to
the General, who yet thought it more honorable to make them perform the
Execution themselves in the sight of the _English_, which was done
accordingly.

During their abode here, Commissioners oft pass’d between the
_Spaniards_ and them about the Ransom of the City, but not agreeing, the
_English_ spent every Morning till the heat of the Day in firing and
destroying the Houses in the outward part of the City, two hundred
Mariners being employ’d therein for divers days; yet were the Houses
built so magnificently and strongly of Stone, that they could not
consume one third part of the Town all that time; whereupon the General
was contented to accept of twenty five thousand _Ducats_ of 5_s._ 6_d._
apiece to spare the rest.

Here his Soldiers met with good Pillage, especially of rich Apparel, but
Treasure they found none; for the _Spaniards_ by their Cruelties had so
destroy’d the Natives, who us’d to work in the Mines of Gold and Silver,
that they were wholly given over; and in that Island they were forc’d to
use Copper Money: yet they found store of Wine, Oyl, Vinegar, Wheat,
Woollen and Linnen Cloth, some Silks, _&c._ which much reliev’d them:
there was but little Plate found, but good store of _Porcelane_, or
_China_ Dishes; yet some they found, and very costly Houshold-stuff.

[Sidenote: _Venables_ his Expedition to _San Domingo_.]

_Venables_ his Expedition was in the Year 1654. when _Cromwell_ having
gain’d the supream Power under the Title of _Protector_, and having us’d
so many Engines for the getting of Money to maintain his Greatness and
usurp’d Authority, that he was almost brought to his last Shifts,
bethought himself of this Project, (or, as some suppose, had it put into
his Head by Cardinal _Mazarine_, the then great Minister of State in
_France_, with whom he had intimate Correspondence) thinking thereby to
kill two Birds with one Stone: for on the one side, he thought by this
notable Exploit to advance his Fame abroad, and gain Credit and Applause
with the People at home, by enlarging his Empire, and spreading the
Renown of the _English_ Nation, and so consequently to establish himself
the more firmly in his new gotten Power; and at the same time by the
great Riches he promis’d to himself from this Adventure, to recruit his
Stock, which all his griping Exactions, especially from the King’s
Party, could scarce supply for the keeping up of his Army, maintaining
Intelligence, and other vast Expences: To this end he sets forth a
considerable Fleet with extraordinary speed and secrecy, it not being
known whither this Fleet was design’d till they were almost upon the
very Place, that the _Spaniard_ might not be forewarn’d to provide
against them, onely in general terms it was given out, that the Design
was both advantageous to the Nation, and would prove a great enrichment
to all that went upon it; so that it is no great wonder, if within a
short space a good competent Army was got together of such as having
neither Estates nor Employments, willingly offer’d themselves, as Men
that went from the fear of Iron Grates, to the hopes of Golden Ingots;
and many of them were such as having been in the late King’s Army, and
disdaining to take any Employment at home under that Government, were
easily induc’d to List themselves in this Armada: nor was _Oliver_ a
little glad of this occasion of sending out of the Land, and employing
upon a desperate Adventure those Men, who he had reason to suspect
would, upon any opportunity offer’d, be the first Opposers of his
usurp’d Power. This Army being sent to _Portsmouth_ for Embarquation,
and there making such Preparations as was convenient, which a Moneths
time or thereabouts was thought would accomplish, a Messenger came from
_Desborough_ (who was there to set them going) to the General, that he
should prepare to Embarque on _Christmas_-day; which at the first the
General receiv’d with great impatience, alledging, That it was not
possible so to do, and that he would not set Sail without his Arms and
other Necessaries, which were not yet come from _London_: however, at
his going to _Desborough_ he was prevail’d upon to set Sail, with a
promise that the Ships with the Arms should immediately follow him to
the _Barbado_’s, where he was to stay till their arrival; so on
_Christmas_-day they set Sail, and about the fourteenth of _February_
arriv’d at _Barbado_’s with three thousand Men, and a Company of
Reformado’s, which there were doubled, and then, and not till then, it
was told them, That the reason of their so sudden going away, was
because there was a Plot forming in _England_ for restoring the King,
and that they were not thought fit to be left there at the Head of their
Regiments, to be tempted with the advantage of joyning with any such
Party. At _Barbado_’s they staid till they had almost undone that Place
by eating up their Provisions, the Planters there seldom preparing more
than they have occasion to spend in their Houses, and for their Servants
(having better and more profitable Employments upon their Hands) and the
Soldiers not being content with such Provisions as their Servants would
be well pleas’d with, so that they were in danger of starving the Island
and themselves too: Thereupon a Council of War was call’d, and the
necessity of leaving that Island declar’d, and Orders issu’d out to set
Sail for _Hispaniola_, where they might make such Attempt as their
Condition would allow, wanting Arms and other Necessaries; when they
came within five or six Leagues of _Hispaniola_ the Fleet lay by, and a
Council of War was call’d by the Commissioners (for such they had who
were never Soldiers) with some few Officers of the Army, where it was
resolv’d to attempt _San Domingo_, and an Order made, That in case it be
taken, no Soldier should offer to Plunder, but that satisfaction in lieu
thereof should be given by the Commissioners; the Officers of the Army
in vain opposing and protesting against it, which occasion’d the
Soldiers to say, That the Commissioners should take the Town themselves,
for they would not; Lots were there drawn by the several Colonels who
should first Land, which fell upon the Black Regiment, who had no Arms
but Half-pikes of eight Foot long, made of Cabbage-Tree in the
_Barbado_’s; And Orders were then given out to the several Colonels to
Land at the River _Hind_, within two Leagues of _San Domingo_; so they
steer’d their Course thither, as was thought, by Night, but the next
Morning found themselves twenty Leagues at least from the place of
Rendezvouz, though one Regiment Landed there, who durst not attempt the
Town for want of Orders, though doubtless they might have taken it, had
they not staid in expectation of the General and the rest of the Fleet;
but when they were thus cast Leeward of the Town, they must Land their
Men, who no sooner went on Shore, but the Order against Plundering was
read, and the Soldiers in a Mutiny to whom it was read, which made the
rest forbear to read it, judging it no time now to disoblige them, who
had in their Officers opinion too just a cause of discontent: However
this was made known to the rest, and discours’d as they march’d, That
they had not thought to be under a Committee here, but they would make
them weary of their Employment ere they had done: And this indeed was
enough, besides the faintness and unusual Heat of the Countrey, to
disanimate Men of good Resolutions, especially the ordinary Soldiers,
whose hopes of Plunder is the chiefest prop to their Courage, and
expected Gain the spurr to their Valour. After they had Landed their
Men, next Morning early they march’d towards _San Domingo_; but before
Noon the Heat and Drought which they felt made them sensible of their
first Errour and Inadvertency, in coming from _England_ without their
Necessaries; for through want of Bottles, which were left behind, and
came not till three Moneths afterwards, the Men fell down dead in the
High-ways, every one fainting and languishing, and crying out for Water:
shortly after they met with a Field of Oranges, which was no unwelcome
sight, with which they stor’d themselves; but ere they had march’d four
or five Miles thought they had quench’d their present Thirst, and their
Drought began to increase however, they march’d on, leaving some of
their Men dead on the place, others fainting, were set upon the Troopers
Horses till they came that Night to some Water, which gave them new
life, and the Morrow early march’d again till they came within some
Miles of the appointed Rendezvouz, where they heard of the other
Regiment that Landed at the right place: And now having refresh’d
themselves with Rest, Water, and Provision, they march’d to the taking
of the Town; the General himself, with a small Party and a Guide, went
towards the Town to find out some Water, which he knew the Soldiers
would want, (not having Bottles to carry any) but as they were on their
March, which was very leisurely by reason of the Heat, they heard a
firing of Musquets, then making more speed in their March, supposing an
Engagement, in the Highway, about a Mile from the Town, was found one of
the General’s Secretaries, with others, dead; and not long after some
came back to the General, and told him, That looking for Water with the
Guide, an Ambuscade issu’d out, and had kill’d the Guide that should
have shew’d them the place of Water, and some others; and although some
which Commanded the foremost Regiments were very forward and willing to
assault the Town, yet it was not thought fit so to do till the Army came
up, by which time it was Night; and though they were then within half a
Mile of the Town, yet the Soldiers were so impatient for Water, that
they could not stay till the next Morning to assault the Town, but were
forc’d to march back to the River _Hind_ about eight Miles; (and this
Relater did at that time drink his own Water) there they staid till they
had again refresh’d themselves, and then prepar’d for their Return to
attaque the Town; and notwithstanding the March it self in a hot
Countrey was irksom enough, yet they were forc’d to make the Soldiers to
draw the Ordnance and other Carriages for want of Harness and other
Necessaries, which were left behind; however, they willingly underwent
it by Turns: And now a Forlorn was drawn out, and other Orders given for
a March, especially it being taken notice of, that the Enemies manner of
Fight was and would be by Ambuscades, a File in every Company were
order’d to stand till the other came up, and to face to the Right and
Left to the Woods, which were all along as they went, for fear of a
Surprize; and the Forlorn marching near an old Fort, call’d _Jeronymo_,
which we had been possess’d of before, but thought not worth the
keeping, and fearing they might meet with some small opposition there,
began to fortifie themselves, and took a Dram of the Bottle, which as
they were drinking, and others eating a bit, suddenly rush’d forth an
Ambush of about a hundred and twenty _Blacks_, with a _Spanish_
Commander in the Head of them, which so amaz’d and surpriz’d them, that
some few onely Discharging, the rest immediately fled; the _Blacks_
quickly falling in with their Lances, and doing such Execution as the
time would allow them; for presently the Alarm being taken, and Supplies
marching out for their relief, the Enemy, who had done more than they
could possibly expect to have done, retreated into their Fort, which
they had better fortifi’d than before, and had planted some small Drakes
there upon it; the Execution was so short, that they had not time either
to strip or pick a Pocket, lest they had paid too dear for it. After
this Defeat a Council of War was call’d, and there it was agreed the
next Morning early to fall on upon that little Fort, and so proceed to
the taking of the Town; but very early, as they were in that
expectation, Orders came from the General to the Army to march back to
the River _Hind_, for what reason this Relator (though a considerable
Person) never yet knew; where after they had staid some time, that
Miscarriage was question’d at a Council of War, and one of the chief
Officers of the Forlorn order’d to have his Sword broke over his Head,
with other disgraceful Impositions, and two Colonels of the Army were
order’d to draw up the Causes of this Miscarriage to send to _England_;
which, because ’twas thought would too much reflect on them in Power
that were to supply them, was by those Colonels judg’d inconvenient, and
so ’twas never done. The number of Men lost by Stragling, Sickness, and
this unhappy Engagement, amounted in the whole to about two hundred and
thirty. In a short time after this, it was order’d to Ship the Men;
which done, after some Debates amongst the Commissioners what was best
to be done, Provisions nor Utensils yet coming fit for the Design
intended, which was to possess some considerable Place in the _Main_, it
was agreed, That they should steer their Course for the Island of
_Jamaica_; which they did accordingly, and on the tenth day of _May
1654._ with little opposition possess’d it: where the same Soldiers have
shew’d not onely such Courage and Resolution upon all occasions, (in
many and frequent Encounters and Invasions made by the _Spaniards_, not
onely with Soldiers of those Parts, but such as have been sent from
_Spain_, _Naples_, _Catalonia_, and other Places) as might speak them
_English_-men but such hath been their Patience and Sufferance, as none
of this Nation in the memory of Man have ever been put to, the Effects
whereof their King and Countrey, ’tis hop’d, will have occasion to
remember, to their immortal Honor and Renown.

[Illustration: PORTO RICO]

_Hispaniola_ is surrounded with several other Isles, as 1. Eastward
appears _Saona_, full of pleasant Woods and Pastures, with Cattel
feeding on them: in former times it produc’d much _Cazabi_ for the City
_Domingo_; but since the _Spaniards_ murder’d all the Inhabitants _Anno
1502._ it hath never been inhabited. 2. The Rocky Shelf _St. Catalina_.
3. _Abaque._ 4. _Navaza._ 5. _Guanabo._ 6. _Tortuga_, abounding in Hogs,
and 7. _Beata_, famous for the excellent speckled Wood which grows
there, and a swift River, which oftentimes detains the Ships there whole
Moneths.

                               CHAP. XIV.
                        Porto Rico, and Monico.


[Sidenote: Bounds and Extent of _Porto Rico_.]

Another of those call’d _The Isles of Barlovento_, is _Boriquen_,
anciently so nam’d, but now more generally _Porto Rico_, from _St. Juan
de Porto Rico_, its chief Town, is an Island fifteen Leagues distant
from _Santa Crux_, to the North-West, and about as many from
_Hispaniola_ to the South-East, but from the Continent or main Land of
_Paria_ (which seems to be the nearest) a hundred and thirty, or a
hundred thirty six, as some reckon. It lieth almost in a quadrangular
Form, being suppos’d to contain about thirty Leagues in length, and not
less than twenty in breadth, in eighteen and nineteen Degrees of
Northern Latitude.

The Island on the North, which is less fruitful than the South part,
produces Gold, and is generally water’d with many Rivers. There is also
Silver, Tin, Lead, Quicksilver, and _Azure_, us’d by Painters. The Rain
generally falls there between _May_ and _August_. A little before, or in
the beginning of Harvest, the Hurricanes breaking forth from the Clouds,
rage in such a manner, that it is impossible for any Ships to endure the
Sea, and a Northern Blast generally doth great damage to the Plants
here.

[Sidenote: _Sierra del Loquillo._]

Ten Leagues towards the South-East beyond _Porto Rico_, appears _Sierra
del Loquillo_, being a continu’d Ridge of Mountains which runs through
the whole Island from East to West, extending both ways to the very
Sea-shore.

[Illustration]

[Sidenote: Rivers.]

Twenty three Rivers discharge their Waters also into the Ocean; amongst
which the chiefest is _Cairabon_, particularly noted for ten Sugar-Mills
which are erected upon its Banks.

[Sidenote: Trees.]

The Hills, Plains, and Valleys, are invested with variety of Trees
peculiar to this place, as _Tabunuco_, which affords a medicinal Gum,
good against Lameness, and green Wounds: it is also of great use to
preserve a Ship’s Keel from the Worms.

Another Tree call’d _Maga_, is everlasting Wood, and bears a great
Flower like a Rose.

The Leaves of the _Higillo Pintado_-Tree cures all manner of Bruises.

The same power is also in the little Tree _Sancta Maria_; as likewise in
another by the _Spaniards_ call’d _Balsamo_.

The Body of the Tree _Zoyla_ is so thick, that fifteen Men holding Hands
together, cannot encompass the same.

The speckled Wood, and _Cassia Fistula_ grow also here in great
abundance.

[Sidenote: The poisonous Apple-Tree.]

Here is likewise Apple-Trees, which grow by Rivers sides, or on the
Sea-shore, whose Fruit is rank Poyson, and who-ever sleeps under the
shadow of them, will certainly be Lame: The Fruit eaten generally causes
Death; or if Nature be so strong in him that eats of it, to overcome the
same, yet he is certain to lose his Hair.

As hurtful is the prickly Herb _Quibey_, which bears white Flowers like
Violets.

[Sidenote: The Tree _Guiaba_.]

But this Island receives the greatest prejudice by the Tree _Guaiaba_,
because it grows in most places, and over-runs Plains and Hills, so
spoiling all the Grass, between which and the fore-mention’d Tree there
is such an antipathy, that none will grow near it. The Tree bears a
brown Apple full of Kernels, which are eaten by Beasts and Fowls, and
from which falling on the Ground when ripe, grow up in new Trees, which
makes the Countrey a meer Wilderness: The Body of it is smooth and of a
pale colour, the Leaves hard, and glittering, and grow two and two over
one another; the Flowers have also five Leaves, in the middle of which
rises a Crown like that on a Peacock’s Head: The Fruit, which is cover’d
with a soft Doun, and somewhat longer than the _European_ Apple, when
cut through, hath a pale red Pulp, full of eatable Kernels: before it is
ripe, it is of a sharp taste, yet good boyl’d, but when ripe, of a most
delicious and pleasant rellish; nevertheless too much of it causes a
Lask: The Roots, which are red without, and white within, are juicy,
sweet, and very long, the Leaves sallow and sowre of taste.

[Sidenote: The Beast _Javaris_.]

Amongst the strange Beasts the _Javaris_, _Opassum_, and _Tatow_ are the
most remarkable. The _Javaris_ are taken for a sort of wild Hogs, and
have short Ears and a Navel on their Backs, little Tails, some black,
and some spotted white.

[Sidenote: The _Opassum_.]

The _Opassum_ is as big as a Cat, hath a sharp Mouth, the upper Jaw-bone
hanging over the lower, long, straight, and broad Ears, and a very long
Tail, bald at the end, which winds in a Circle; on its Back black Hair
sprinkled with grey Spots, and with its sharp Claws climbs up the Trees,
where it feeds on Fruit, and sometimes preys on Fowls. Nature hath
furnish’d this Beast with a strange Bag under its Belly, whereof the
in-side hath a far softer Doun than the out-side, in which the young
ones lie and suck, after which the Bag opening, they creep out upon the
Ground. The Males have also a Bag, which serves onely to carry their
Young in, for they and the Females carry them by turns.

[Sidenote: The _Tatow_.]

The _Tatow_, which is arm’d with sharp Scales, hath the Mouth of a Hog,
and at each Foot five sharp Nails: when it is Hunted, or goes to sleep
in the Night, it draws its Head, Legs and Tail under its scaly Coat of
Mail, like a Tortoise, and in that manner lies secure against all manner
of danger.

The Venison taken here is very delicate, but difficult to be got; for
this Beast having a breathing-place in its Back, never tires with
running, and when encompass’d by the Dogs, falls valiantly on those that
are nearest to it, and often tears them in pieces.

[Sidenote: Chief Towns and Cities.]

The chief Towns in this Island, are 1. _Porto Rico_ it self, commonly
call’d _St. John de Porto Rico_ (so term’d by _Christopher Columbus_, as
being the first Land discover’d by him in the Year 1493. at that time
when he could not perswade his Seamen, wearied out with continual
hardship, from returning, if they discover’d not Land in two days) a
strong and neat Town, built by the Command of _Philip_ the Second, King
of _Spain_: It was attempted by Sir _Francis Drake_ in the Year 1595.
without success, but a few years after taken by the Earl of
_Cumberland_.

2. _St. Germans_, in the West part of the Island, three or four Leagues
distant from the Sea.

3. _Arrecibo_, Westward from _Porto Rico_, where the most noted Haven is
of those Parts, for all the others are full of Rocks and Sands.

The antient Inhabitants of this Island maintain’d continual Wars with
the Cannibals (probably the Natives of the Islands so call’d) who us’d
every year to come thither: those that were conquer’d, as well of the
one side as of the other, were eaten by the Conquerors, so that in
effect, both sides were but a different sort of Cannibals.

_Columbus_ Landing here, found a great House surrounded with twelve
others, but all of them empty and desolate.

This Island (which formerly is said to have been under the absolute
Power of one sole King) the _Spaniards_ not much regarded at first,
having enough to do with _Hispaniola_, where they found more Gold than
on _Porto Rico_.

[Sidenote: The building of _St. Germans_.]

_Anno 1510._ _John Ponce de Leon_ obtain’d a Commission from the Court
of _Spain_, to be chief Governor of this Island, and built _Caparra_,
which Place was inhabited twelve years, notwithstanding it stood behind
a scraggy Mountain, in a desart place far up in the Countrey; but their
thirst after Gold, of which some Veins were discover’d there, made them
dispence with all other inconveniences: yet at last beginning to be
weary of this desolate and barren place of Settlement, they remov’d to
_Guanica_, water’d by many Rivers, whose Sands had great quantities of
Gold-dust. Not staying long there, they went four Leagues farther, and
call’d their new Plantation _Soto Major_. Lastly, returning again, they
setled themselves in the former Valley _Guanica_, and built the
fore-mention’d Town _St. Germans_ by the River _Guaorabo_, which makes
an inconvenient Haven.

[Sidenote: The Situation, Description and Fate of _St. Juan de Porto
           Rico_.]

_Juan de Porto Rico_ stands Eastward at the beginning of the North
Coast, on a small _Peninsula_, joyn’d to the Island by an high _Isthmus_
call’d _Puente de Aguilar_. Near the Mouth of the Haven lies on a rising
Hill the Fort _Morro Empinado_, built triangular by _John de Texila_ and
_Baptista Antonelli_ (who also planted there forty Guns), and surrounded
with the Sea, which renders it a well fortifi’d place. The Governor
_Diego Mendez de Valdez_ had in it fifteen hundred Men and eighty
Horses, when the fore-mention’d valiant Duke of _Cumberland_ with a far
less number fell upon him in the Year 1597. and not onely took the City
_Porto Rico_, but several other Fortifications; and besides an
invaluable mass of Treasure he carried away eighty Guns. Sometime before
this Defeat the _Spaniards_ under the Government of _Christopher_, Son
to the _Portuguese_ Duke of _Camigna_, were Invaded by the Cannibals,
and all that were then upon the place utterly destroy’d, none of them
escaping but the Bishop and his Servants, who betimes fled away with the
Church Ornaments; so that the Islanders from that time were put out of
doubt that the _Spaniards_ were mortal, for they suppos’d them immortal
when first they saw their great Ships, and heard the noise of their
thundering Cannon.

[Sidenote: The Casique _Yaguara_’s Experiment.]

_Hugh Linschot_ relates, That the Casique _Yaguara_ threw a _Spaniard_
into the Water, to try whether he would drown or not, and seeing him
wholly depriv’d of Life, he concluded by consequence that the rest of
them were mortal, and thereupon he set upon them when they were seeking
for Gold, and kill’d above a hundred and fifty of them.

_Peter Martyr_ relates farther, That these People, though very expert in
Arms, yet were oftentimes beaten by the Cannibals, who at one time
carried above five thousand People out of _Porto Rico_ for their Winter
Provisions.

[Sidenote: The Avarice and Cruelty of the _Spaniards_.]

Nor was their Condition better’d after the _Spaniards_ conquer’d the
Island, for those that could not furnish them with Gold, were certain of
Death: Nor were their Cruelties in other places undivulg’d to this
People before their Arrival; whereupon (as is related by _Peter Ordonnez
de Carellos_) the Casique _Hatvey_ being inform’d of the _Spaniards_
Approach, took an Oath from his Subjects, That they should never
discover where the Gold lay, though they should be put to death for it;
_For_ (said he) _Gold is their God, for which they make so many cursed
Blood-baths where-ever they come; therefore throw the Gold into some
very deep Waters, for when the_ Spanish _God is sunk, the_ Spaniards
_will lose their Courage, and not plague us so much for it_.

[Sidenote: Ceremonies of the old Natives.]

Many were the Idolatrous Ceremonies of the old Natives of this Place,
which would be too tedious to relate; but amongst the rest, they
annually kept a great Feast, at which the _Casiques_ summon’d all their
Subjects to a Temple appointed for that purpose, where the Priests had
prepar’d an Idol ready set forth in all its Pageantry; near which the
_Casique_ plac’d himself, when upon the beating of a Drum all the
Commonalty came also into the Temple; the Men painted with divers
Colours, having on their Heads Plumes of Feathers, about their Necks,
Legs, and Arms, Strings of Sea-shells. The Married Women had a light
Covering about their Middle, but the Maids went stark naked, all of them
Dancing and Singing Songs in praise of the Idol; after which having
saluted the _Casique_, they thrust little Sticks down their Throats, so
to bring up all they had upon their Stomachs; which done, and sitting
down with their Legs under them, they began to Sing anew, often bowing
and shewing Reverence to the _Casique_; whilest some Women carried
Baskets of Bread amongst those that Sang, and utter’d certain Prayers,
which were answer’d by some of the Men; the Bread being bless’d by the
Priests, they gave every one a piece, with which they return’d home very
merry and jocund.

But the God of this Island, whoever he was, hath been a long time left
without Worshippers; for those that were left by the Invading Cannibals,
were cruelly massacred by the _Spaniards_, insomuch that they have been
thereby necessitated to furnish themselves with _Negro_’s to work in
their Mines and Sugar-Mills; and these also not able to endure such hard
Entertainment, ran most of them away; for when a _Negro_ did not bring
Gold enough home at Night, his Master tying him naked to a Stake or
Post, and beat him with Rods or Switches so long, till the Blood ran
down his Back, then pour’d boyling Oyl into the Wounds, and then threw
Pepper and Salt into them, and so let him lie, or else put him into a
Pit, out of which his Head appear’d onely. But those that fled gathering
together, sometimes met with the _Spaniards_, and paid them in their own
Coin.


[Sidenote: The Islands _Mona_ and _Monico_.]

Eastward of _Porto Rico_, and betwixt it and _Hispaniola_, there lieth a
little, but fruitful Island call’d _Mona_; and Westward of that, another
call’d _Monico_, or _Monetta_; which last the _English_, when time was,
found so admirably stor’d with a sort of wild Fowl, that the huge
Flights of them seem’d to darken the Air over their Heads, and upon
their Landing found such plenty of their Eggs upon the Shore and Ground
thereabouts, that they presently laded two of their Boats with them. But
how peopled or possess’d, not so well known.

                                 Cuba.


[Sidenote: The several Names of _Cuba_.]

[Sidenote: Its Bounds.]

Westward, or rather to the North-West of _Hispaniola_, lieth _Cuba_,
accounted one of the four Isles of _Barlovento_, and by _Columbus_, upon
his first Discovery, call’d _Joanna_, afterwards _Fernandina_, then
_Alpha_ and _Omega_, till at last the present Name prevail’d; it is
parted from the other by a Frith, or narrow Channel, which runneth
betwixt the Capes of _St. Nicholas_, belonging to _Hispaniola_, and that
call’d _Mayzi_, belonging to _Cuba_: On the North it hath a Frie of
little Islands call’d _The Leucayæ Islands_, of which more in their
proper place, so many and so thick scatter’d, that they serve for no
small Security and Defence of the Island on that side; besides, a part
of the _Peninsula_ of _Florida_, which Coasteth it likewise Northward;
on the West it hath the Countrey of _Jucatan_, which is part of the
Continent, but at a distance of forty or fifty Leagues; and on the
South, _Jamaica_. It is reckon’d to be in length from Cape _Mayzi_,
which looks towards _Hispaniola_ to the Cape of _St. Anthony_, which is
upon the Bay of _Mexico_, two hundred and thirty Leagues; but in breadth
in some places not above fifteen or sixteen Leagues over; in the
broadest place from _Jardines_ to _Lucanaca_, not above forty, in others
sixty five. But for fertility of Soil, contending with _Hispaniola_ it
self, and for temperature and healthiness of Air, much exceeding it; nor
less rich formerly in good Mines both of Gold and Silver, and
plentifully stor’d at present, not onely with Sugar-Canes of the best
Growth, but likewise with abundance of Ginger-Roots, _Cassia-Fistula_,
Mastick, Aloes, Cinamon, Long-Pepper of _America_, as they call it, and
divers other sorts of Spices. The Pastures no less abounding with Cattel
of all sorts, especially of _European_ Breed; the Rivers and Coasts of
the Sea with good Fish; no scarcity of Fowl, whether wild or tame; good
Brass and Iron still found, with some Gold in the Rivers, especially
those which fall into the Bay _Xagua_ on the South side of the Island;
the chiefest thereof are _Arimao_, _La Luna_, _De Mares_, and _Cauto_;
the biggest of them falls Southward into the Sea; all of them breed
store of Crocodiles, which have oftentimes seiz’d both upon Men and
Beasts, and carrying them into the Water, devour’d them there.

[Sidenote: Trees.]

The Cedars breathe forth a most excellent sweet smell, and grow so
large, that out of the single Trunks of some of them Boats are said to
have been made, capable to hold forty, sometimes sixty Men.

There are also many other very odoriferous Trees, yielding a certain
Rozen or Gum, no less precious than the _Storax_.

[Sidenote: Birds.]

But nothing grows here more plentifully than Vines, the Bodies or Stocks
of which are as thick as a Man’s Middle, and bear excellent Grapes.

Besides Partridges, Turtle-Doves, and other Fowl, the Sea-shore breeds
thousands of Cranes, which when young, are white, but when old, become
of several Colours; they stand commonly with their Legs in salt Water,
which they drink.

[Sidenote: Manner of taking Parrots.]

The Parrots which breed here us’d to be taken by the Natives after a
strange manner: A Boy having a Bundle of Herbs about his Head, climbs up
to the top of a Tree, holding a Parrot over his Head, which by griping
he forces to make a noise, and thereby draws others to come flying about
him; upon which, being expert in this Art, he throws a String with a
Noose made fast to a Stick about them, and pulls them to him.

There are a sort of four-footed Serpents, by the Natives call’d
_Yguanas_, of which they us’d to eat.

The Flesh of Tortoises or Turtles, was accounted a great Dainty amongst
them, especially those of the biggest size, of which some have been
known to weigh a hundred and thirty Pound: The Feet of them are said to
cure the Leprosie and Scabs.

Amongst the peculiar Trees of this Countrey, are the _Zagua_ and the
_Caninga_.

The Cotton, which is of the natural Growth of this Place, is exceeding
fine.

Here is also the Bird _Flamingo_, and another sort of Bird call’d
_Bambayas_.

In former times _Cuba_ was Govern’d by several Lords, each Commanding
over his own Province.

[Sidenote: Chief Provinces of _Cuba_.]

The chiefest of these Provinces are _Mayzi_, _Bayamo_, _Cueyba_,
_Camguey_, _Macaca_, _Xagua_, _Habana_, and _Uhima_; some of them are
plain, others mountainous, and being more or less fruitful, were very
populous, before the _Spaniards_ came thither, but since their cruel
Massacres, scarce any of the antient Natives are left: Nor are the
_Spaniards_ here at present very populous, considering the largeness of
the Island.

In the Province of _Camaguey_ is a Valley three Leagues in bigness,
where Nature produces a great number of large Stones so exactly round,
that no Man with a Compass can make a more exact Circle.

Though the Gold, which is digg’d out of the Mines, and found in Rivers,
is none of the purest, yet the Copper which this Countrey affords is
accounted excellent.

[Illustration: HAVANA]

[Sidenote: Serpents.]

The Serpents here are about the bigness of a Hare, having Heads like
Weezles; they prey on little Beasts call’d _Guabiniquinazes_, and have
been accounted delicious and wholsom Meat.

[Sidenote: Antient Customs of the Natives.]

The antient Natives went formerly naked. The Men made it a Custom to
forsake their Wives when they pleas’d; yet the Women were still oblig’d
to be faithful to them, though from the very first day of their Marriage
they were taught to Cuckold them, by a certain wicked Ceremony in use
amongst them; for the Bridegroom lay not with his Bride the first Night,
but suffer’d her to be enjoy’d by one of his Friends of equal Quality
with himself, whether he were Lord, Merchant, Laboring-man, or what
Estate soever.

[Sidenote: The _Spaniard_ at first beaten by the Natives.]

This Island was reduc’d under the _Spanish_ Government not without great
effusion of Blood; for the Natives having had continual Wars with the
Cannibals, as hath been said, were not ignorant in the Exercise of Arms.
The first _Spanish_ Commander sent against them was _Valdivia_, whom
they slew with all his Men, and hew’d his Ship in pieces. Little better
escap’d _Fogeda_, whose Men were all cut off, and he himself escaping
very miraculously, died not long after of his Wounds in _St. Domingo_.

[Sidenote: _St. Jago_ built by _Valasquez_.]

Within two years after, _viz._ _Anno 1514._ _Diego Velasquez_ with
better success set forth for _Cuba_, where the first thing he did was to
build a City, which he call’d _St. Jago_, lying near a Southern Bay,
full of Fish, and defended with several small Isles, behind which the
Ships in the greatest Storm may Ride very secure; by reason whereof the
new City increas’d so much, that in a short time it could shew two
thousand Inhabitants, a brave Church, a Cloyster, and was made a
Bishop’s See, but subordinate to that of _St. Domingo_.

[Sidenote: The Copper Mountains.]

[Sidenote: _St. Jago_ taken by the _English_.]

Three or four Leagues from the City are those famous Mountains, by the
_Spaniards_ call’d _Sierra de Cobre_, or _The Copper Mountains_, from
the abundance of that Metal which the Mines in them afforded, and do yet
afford; but the City was afterwards almost left desolate, (divers Houses
in the same standing empty) having in it scarce two hundred Inhabitants;
which made it the easier to be taken by a hundred and sixty
_English_-men, led by Captain _Cliff_, _Anno 1601._ who carried from
thence a hundred thousand Pieces of Eight, and a Ships Lading of Hides
and Sugar.

[Sidenote: _Baracoa._]

2. Besides _St. Jago_, _Valasquez_ built the Town _Baracoa_, on the
Eastern Shore of _Cuba_, wash’d by the River _Mares_, which falls into
the Ocean between two Mountains on one side, and a flat Point on the
other, and is a most excellent Harbor: Not far from which grows the best
Ebony Wood.

[Sidenote: _St. Salvador._]

3. He also built the Town _St. Salvador_, one of the most healthful
Promontories of all _Cuba_, near the River _Bayamo_, which produces
round Stones, us’d there in stead of Bullets.

[Sidenote: _Trinidad._]

4. He likewise built _Trinidad_, before which hardly accessible Harbor
many a Ship hath been cast away: But this Fort was by a mighty Storm
levell’d even with the Ground.

[Sidenote: _Puerto del Principe._]

5. Near the Haven before the Town _Puerto del Principe_ is a Fountain,
out of which at certain times flows liquid Pitch.

[Sidenote: _Villa Sancti Spiritus._]

6. The Town call’d _Villa Sancti Spiritus_, six Leagues from the Ocean,
boasts fifty brave Houses, and is wash’d by the River _Saaz_.

[Sidenote: _Havana._]

7. The chiefest City which the _Spaniards_ possess in the _West-Indies_,
and the present Seat of their Governor, is _Christovall de Havana_;
which stood first on the South side of _Cuba_, but was afterwards built
on the North, opposite to _Florida_: The Harbor before it is large and
safe, for it is able to contain a thousand Ships, without the least
endangering of one another, and yet the Entrance so narrow, between a
Promontory and a square Fort, that two Ships cannot Sail in together:
the shallowest part thereof hath six Fathom Water. On each side the
Mouth of the Harbor is a Fort, the one call’d _Mesa de Maria_, which
stands built on a Champain Ground; the other call’d _Morro_, which lies
at the Foot of two Hills, on whose tops several Guns are planted, which
Command the Town and Haven.

Betwixt these two Forts is a Tower cover’d, on the top whereof is a
round Lantern, wherein stands continually a Watch-man, who puts forth as
many Flags as he discovers Ships at Sea, to give notice thereof to the
City, which is a Mile from thence.

Before _Havana_ stands a third Castle, well stor’d with Guns, as
likewise the rest are, in all to the number of two hundred and forty,
and strongly Garrison’d; of which great care was taken by the General
_Jean de Texeda_, and _Baptista Antonelli_, an Architect, sent thither
by _Philip_ the Second, King of _Spain_, to secure the Place from all
foreign Assaults, because the Plate-Fleet, and other Ships that come out
of the _West-Indies_, have their place of Rendezvouz here, and from
hence set Sail altogether for _Spain_. The City stands along the Haven,
and hath two Churches with spiry Steeples. The Houses are now built
after the _Spanish_ manner.

[Sidenote: _Havana_ several times Assaulted and taken.]

But _Havana_ was not so strongly fortifi’d in former times, for _Anno
1536._ it could not resist a mean _French_ Pyrate, who losing the rest
of his Fleet was driven hither by Storm, and conquering _Havana_, had
burnt the same, consisting at that time of woodden Houses cover’d with
Thatch, had not the _Spaniards_ redeem’d them from the Fire for seven
hundred _Ducats_; with which Money the _French_ set Sail, when the day
following three Ships arriv’d from _New Spain_ before _Havana_, and
having unladed their Goods, and preparing themselves for Battel, pursu’d
the Pyrate; whom getting sight of, the Admiral, who Sail’d before, durst
not venture to Engage him alone, but staid for the other two Ships: from
which cowardly Action the _French_ Pyrate taking Courage, fell on the
_Spanish_ Admiral, who without firing a Gun ran his Ship ashore, and
deserted the same: the next Ship thereby discourag’d Tacking about, made
away from the Enemy; on which the third also follow’d, insomuch that at
last they were all three taken by the _French_; who encourag’d with this
unexpected Victory, steer’d their Course a second time to _Havana_,
where they got as much more Money from the Inhabitants as before. After
this the _Spaniards_ built all their Houses of Stone, and a Fort at the
Mouth of the Harbor, yet nevertheless the City lay open on the Land
side; of which the _English_ Fleet, Cruising about in those Seas, being
inform’d, Landed not far from _Havana_, and enter’d the City before
Day-break: the _Spaniards_ thus suddenly surpriz’d, fled into the Woods,
whilest the _English_ plunder’d and ransack’d the City without any
resistance. But this was not the last Blow which _Havana_ receiv’d, for
during the Wars between the Emperor _Charles_ the Fifth, and the
_French_ King _Henry_ the Second, a Ship set Sail with ninety Soldiers
from _Diep_ to _Cuba_, where they made themselves Masters of _St. Jago_,
and carried great Treasure away with them: Thus enrich’d, they set in
the Night on _Havana_, but found their Expectations frustrated, for all
the Houses were empty, the _Spaniards_ (being so often Plunder’d) having
remov’d all their Goods to their Countrey Houses, which lay scattering
about the Island. Whilest the _French_ were searching the Houses, two
_Spaniards_ came under pretence of agreeing with them, but their Design
was chiefly to take an Account of their Enemies Forces. The _French_
demanded six thousand _Ducats_ of them: to which the two _Spaniards_
reply’d, That all their Goods would not raise so much: then going to
their Party, inform’d them of the number of the Enemies, and their
Demands; whereupon Consulting, some judg’d it best to comply with a
forc’d Necessity, and if they could not get any thing abated, to pay the
demanded Sum: but most of them were of another opinion, alledging, That
the number of the _French_ was not equivalent to their Demands, and that
it would not be for their Credit, to yield up their Estates so tamely,
without trying their Title by the Sword: This being judg’d fittest, they
march’d to Engage them with a hundred and fifty Men, which about
Midnight fell on the _French_, and at the first Onset slew four of them;
but upon the firing of the Gun they were all alarm’d, and after a small
Skirmish, put the _Spaniards_ to flight. The Conquerors enrag’d at this
treacherous Plot of the _Spaniards_, set fire on _Havana_, in which at
that time was a good quantity of Pitch and Tarr; with which the Gates,
Windows, Roofs, and Pent-houses being all bedaub’d over, were in few
hours all in a light Flame; after which the Churches in order for their
firing, were also going to be over-laid with the same combustible
Matter; at which a _Spaniard_ boldly desir’d, that the Temples erected
for Gods Service might be spar’d: to which he was answer’d, That People
who keep not their Promise, nor had any Faith, had no need of Churches
to profess their Faith in. The _French_ not satisfi’d with burning,
pull’d down the Walls, and utterly demolish’d the Fort.

[Sidenote: The Haven _Xagua_.]

The Haven _Xagua_ also is not inferior to any, the Mouth thereof being a
Boweshot wide, and within, ten Leagues: The Ships are securely shelter’d
behind three Islands, and also the Mountains, which rise along the
Shore.

[Sidenote: The Success of Admiral _Peter Hein_.]

Moreover, the Inlet _Matanca_ is not onely eminent, by reason of the
round Mountain _Elan de Matancas_, which rises from a low Ground; but
chiefly for the Expeditions of Admiral _Peter Peterson Hein_, who being
sent out by the _West-India_ Company, to Cruse up and down before
_Havana_ with one and thirty Sail, was from thence by a strong Current
driven down to _Matanca_; where he stood from the Shore, when ten Ships
came just running amidst his Fleet, and were all taken but one: About
Noon they discover’d nine Ships more, which Sailing along the Shore, got
into the Inlet _Matanca_, where they ran aground; whither _Hein_
following, came up to them the next Morning by Break-of-day, and after a
small Resistance took them, being valu’d to be worth above a hundred and
fifteen Tun of Gold, besides the Musk, Ambergreece, and _Bezoar_ with
which two other Ships were laden, and another rich Prize.

This large Island _Cuba_ (as we have before observ’d) formerly divided
into so many populous Territories, is now in a manner desolate; for
according to the _Spaniards_ Relation to the Admiral _Henry Jacobson
Lucifer_, when he was before _Havana_, _Cuba_ had upon it not above
sixty thousand Persons in all, in _Anno 1627._ But who-ever Reads that
which Bishop _Bartholomeo de las Casas_ hath written in his Book,
(Printed first in _Sivill_ in the _Spanish_ Tongue, and afterwards, with
the King of _Spain_’s leave, in _French_ at _Antwerp_) will easily find
the reason, why _Cuba_ and many other _Indian_ Countreys lie so
desolate; and how sensible the _Indians_ were of the _Spaniards_ usage,
appears by this following Story, related by the said Bishop, of a
_Casique_ call’d _Hathuey_, who before the _Spaniards_ approach’d his
Countrey, _Anno 1511._ fled from _Hispaniola_ to _Cuba_; where
afterwards he was taken by the _Spaniards_, and condemn’d to be burnt
alive with green Wood: whilest he was tying to a Stake, a _Franciscan_
Monk Preach’d to him the Mysteries of the _Christian_ Religion, of which
he had never heard; and likewise that he should ascend up to Heaven if
he dy’d in that Belief; but if not, burn perpetually in Hell: Whereupon
_Hathuey_ asking the _Franciscan_, If there were any _Spaniards_ in
Heaven? and being told there were, answer’d, _I will rather converse
amongst the Devils in Hell, than amongst the_ Spaniards, _whose Cruelty
is such, that none can be more miserable than where_ Spaniards _are_.

Before we conclude the Description of _Cuba_, it will be material to add
some Passages of a Letter from Major _Smith_, Governor of the Isle of
_Providence_, who was taken there in the Year 1665. which will give
light to the knowledge of the present State, not onely of _Cuba_, but of
some other parts of _America_, belonging to the _Spaniards_; which is as
followeth:


[Sidenote: Maj. _Smith_’s Letter concerning _Cuba_ and other Parts.]

_Cuba_ is a very good Island, and in it is generally the best Land, for
so large a Countrey, as I have seen in _America_, although I have
travell’d the main Continent in several places, and have cross’d from
the North Sea to the South Sea, as also the North side of _Hispaniola_,
and most parts of _Jamaica_.

This great Island is easie to be conquer’d, and would make the best
Plantation, besides the prejudice it would be to the _Spaniard_, and the
great advantage to our Nation; for instance, Had we the Port and City of
_Havana_, which might in all probability be reduc’d with two Regiments
of good Soldiers from _Jamaica_, carrying with them two or three Sloops
or Shallops for Landing Men, fitted with good Arms and other Necessaries
for an Assault, presently after their Armado hath pass’d out of the
_Indies_, which is once in two years, towards the latter part of the
Summer. There is good Landing on the West side of the City, where it
lies open; and you need fear no Ambuscado’s: but not on the East side on
the Harbor, for there you will be gawl’d by the strong Castle of the
_Moare_, until the City be secur’d; but when that is once taken, you may
easily reduce that Castle also, there being no danger of their re-taking
it, until the next Armado arrives there, which will be almost two years,
against which time you will have Planters enough from other of our
Islands, to Manure the Land, and assist the Soldiers in defence thereof:
This once effected, would utterly ruine the _Spaniards_, for these
Reasons: Our Ships lying both here and at _Jamaica_, would be at all
times ready to gather up their stragling Fleet, which it is difficult to
keep imbodied without the help of that Port of _Havana_, it being
impossible for their great unruly Ships to turn up to Windward from the
Bay of _Mexico_, or _Puerto Bello_, without separation; and on the other
side, to pass the Gulf of _Florida_, is for them as impossible, where
they always Rendezvouz, Victual, Water, and provide all things necessary
for their Return into _Spain_; after all which they diligently wait for
a convenient Season of Winds and Weather (being much observ’d from the
Changes of the Moon) when to pass that dangerous _Straight_: for to say
truly, the _Spaniards_ are neither very fit for Sea nor Land-Service,
excepting some Officers and Soldiers bred in _Flanders_ for
Land-Service, and a few _Biscainers_ for Sea-Affairs. They are so
sensible of their Weakness, and jealous of their Riches in those Parts,
that it is very difficult for any ingenious Man to get his Liberty,
being once taken, fearing he might give such Intelligence, as to be
thereby the cause of their ruine, witness their blind-folding of all
Strangers, when they pass their Cities and Castles; for they much dread
an old Prophecy amongst them, _viz._ _That within a short time the_
English _will as freely walk the Streets of_ Havana, _as the_ Spaniards
_now do_; which indeed had been easily perform’d with a third part of
the _English_ Army sent to _Jamaica_, and a far greater advantage to the
Nation: for I esteem that Port and Harbor of _Havana_ in the
_West-Indies_, equivalent (against that Nation) to _Tangier_ in the
_Straights_ of _Gibraltar_; and if we were at once Masters of both, it
would without doubt so straiten the _Spaniards_, as absolutely to admit
us a free Trade into their Ports of _America_, where they impart our
Commodities, and sell them for ten times more than they first cost in
_Spain_, by reason of the great plenty of Silver: which Trade would not
onely be of infinite advantage to us, but also prevent them of their
future enslaving of our Nation in Chains as now they do; for being
employ’d about their Fortifications, they are worse us’d, all things
consider’d, than if they were taken by the _Turks_.

[Illustration: JAMAICÆ]

I have seen other parts of the _West-Indies_, where the _Spaniards_
might be fleec’d of considerable quantities of Riches, as at _Panama_,
where their Silver Bars lie pyl’d up in Heaps in the open Streets Day
and Night without Guard for five or six Moneths together, waiting the
arrival of the Armado; which when arriv’d in _Puerto Bello_, they
Transport it thither with so slender a Guard, for so great a Treasure,
as would be an easie Prey to a thousand resolv’d Men (although of
extraordinary value for so small a Charge;) but here is no resting, nor
long remaining, they being so numerous (as in all other places of the
main Land) though of great Wealth, and easily gotten with a Catch and
away: But to my purpose,

This Island of _Cuba_ hath adjacent to it great Conveniences of Salt and
Fishing; and in it are very great plenty of Horses, Neat, Sheep, and
Hogs, both wild and tame, of a far larger and better breed than any
other parts of _America_: It hath also many very rich Mines of Copper
already open, and is the onely Place that supplies all the _West-Indies_
with Metal for the infinite number of Ordnance they have in all their
Ports and Castles, both in the North and South Seas; but whether it hath
any Mines of Silver or Gold, I know not; but if there were any such,
they would not adventure their opening and discovery, fearing the
Invasion of that Island, whereunto is so easie access by Sea, and of so
great import to their whole Interest in _America_: for which reason also
they refuse to work any Mines in _Florida_, that are nigh the North Sea,
(although they have there very many) but do rather employ themselves
about others farther up in the Countrey, although with greater Labor and
Cost, for conveyance of the Product by Land to _Mexico_. And lastly,
(for its full praise) this Island hath many very good Ports and Harbors
of great advantage to Ships, for safe passing the Gulf; and should the
_Spaniards_ keep three or four Frigats always plying between the Western
end of _Cuba_ and that of _Havana_, off and on, it were impossible for
any Ships of ours that came from _Jamaica_ to escape them; the Scales
turn’d would be their Case to all _America_. Neither wants it great
Sugar-works, which have Water-mills and Horse-mills, and very many large
_Cocoa_ Walks, the most and best Tobacco: and in short, it produceth all
other Commodities, that any of our _American_ Islands have knowledge of.

                                Jamaica.


[Sidenote: Situation and Extent of _Jamaica_.]

The Island of _Jamaica_ lieth North from the Southern Continent of
_America_, in the Sea call’d _Mare del Nort_; and South from the Isle of
_Cuba_ about twelve Leagues; and West from _Hispaniola_ twenty, in
eighteen Degrees of Northern Latitude; and beareth from _Rio de Hacha_
North-West, a hundred and fifty Leagues; from _Santa Martha_ North
North-West, a hundred and thirty five; from _Rio Grande_ North-West, a
hundred and thirty; from _Carthagena_ North, fourteen; from _Porto
Bello_ North-East and by North, a hundred and ninety; from the Bay of
_Darien_, North and by East, a hundred and seventy; from the Bay of
_Mexico_, a hundred and fifty. It is of Form something nearly resembling
oval, being in length from East to West, about fifty four Leagues, or a
hundred and seventy Miles; from North to South in the broadest and
middlemost part, about three and twenty Leagues, or seventy Miles over,
and so groweth narrower and narrower towards each Extream; in
circumference about one hundred and fifty Leagues, or four hundred and
fifty _English_ Miles.

[Sidenote: Nature of the Country.]

This Island is well water’d with Springs and Rivers, and is all over,
especially in the Western parts, full of high Hills and Mountains: It is
also well Wooded; for the North and South parts chiefly abound with tall
and large Woods: Nor are there wanting every where _Savanas_, or
Pastures, which are thought to have been Fields of _Indian Maiz_, till
the _Spaniards_ arriving here, brought in Horses, Cows, Hogs, and
_Asinego_’s to feed.

[Sidenote: Temperature of the Air.]

The Air in this Place is more temperate, and the Heat more tolerable,
than in any of the rest of the _Barloventi_, by reason of the cool
Breezes which constantly blow from the East, and the frequency of
Showers of Rain, and refreshing Dews which fall in the Night.

This is also the onely Island of the _Barloventi_, which is not subject
to violent Storms and Hurricanes; and the Diseases which are predominant
here, are onely bred by Intemperance, as Surfets, Feavers, and Agues, or
occasion’d by ill Diet or Slothfulness.

[Sidenote: Commodities of the Island.]

The Commodities of this Island are very many; and first for Vegetables,
the Sugars are so good, that they now out-sell those of _Barbado_’s 5
_s._ _per Cent._

_Cocoa_, of which there are many large Walks; and greater plenty by
improvement may easily be produc’d.

Tobacco, so good, that the Merchants give Six pence a Pound for it, and
buy it faster than the Planters can make it.

Indigo is producible in great abundance, if there were Hands sufficient
employ’d about it.

The Cotton of this Place is accounted very firm and substantial, and
preferr’d before any that grows in the neighboring Islands.

Of Tortoise-shell there is also good store, by reason that much of that
sort of Tortoise is taken on this Coast.

Here are also great variety of Dye-woods, as _Brasiletto_, _Fustwick_,
Red-wood, a kind of Log-wood, and several others, besides divers of
those that are accounted the most curious and rich sorts of Woods, as
Cedar, _Mohogeney_, _Lignum-vitæ_, Ebony, _Granadilla_, and others,
which are frequently Exported.

Moreover, there are very probable testimonies, that there are Mines of
Copper here, since both there have been those who affirm to have seen
the Oar wrought out of one of them, and the _Spaniards_ report the Bells
that hang in the great Church, to have been Cast out of this Island
Copper. As for Silver, the _English_ are said to have been shew’d a
Silver-Mine behind the Mountains, West of _Cagway_.

Ambergreece the _Spaniards_ report to have been often found on this
Coast.

Salt might be made here in great abundance, there being three good
Salt-pans; and Salt-petre hath been found in many Parts.

Ginger is reported to grow better here than in most of the _Caribbee_
Islands; and Cod-pepper very plentifully; and also a certain kind of
Spice call’d _Piemete_, being in the form of _East-India_ Pepper, of a
very aromatical and curious taste, partaking as it were of divers
species together: it grows wild in the Mountains, and is very highly
valu’d amongst the _Spaniards_.

Of Drugs and medicinal Plants there is here a very great abundance, as
_Guaiacum_, _China_-Root, _Cassia-Fistula_, _Veuillard_, _Achiotes_,
_Tamarinds_, _Contrayerva_, _Ciperas_, _Adiantum Nigrum_, _Aloes_,
_Cucumis Agrestis_, _Sumach_, _Acacia_, _Misselto_, with several others,
both Drugs, Balsoms and Gums.

_Cochinele_ is produc’d by a Plant that grows in this Countrey, but it
is not made without much care and curiosity, and the _English_ are not
yet well experienc’d in the Husbanding thereof, besides that the Growth
of the Plant is much obstructed by Easterly Winds.

[Sidenote: Beasts.]

There is here greater store of Cattel than in any of the rest of the
_English_ Plantations in _America_, as Horses, which by reason of the
great number of them, are bought very cheap.

Cow’s, of a large size, and of which vast numbers are yearly kill’d.

_Asinego_’s and Mules, both wild and tame, being a very serviceable sort
of Cattel in those Countreys.

Sheep, large and tall, and whose Flesh is counted exceeding good, but
the Fleece worth little.

Goats in great abundance, being a sort of Cattel very peculiar to that
Countrey.

But of all other Cattel, Hogs are here in the greatest plenty, both wild
in the Mountains, and tame in the Plantations; and they are more in
request for Food than any of the rest, their Flesh being counted both of
a better rellish, and more easily digestible than the Hogs-flesh of our
Parts.

[Sidenote: Fish.]

The Fish that is very plentifully caught in these Coasts is of infinite
variety, and quite of another kind from what we have in this part of the
World, the principal whereof is the Tortoise, which is taken in great
abundance both on these Coasts, and in the Islands _Camavas_.

[Sidenote: Birds.]

The tame Fowl in this Place, are chiefly Hens, Turkies, and Ducks; but
of wild Fowl infinite store, as of _Guinee_ Hens, _Flamingo_’s, Teal,
Ducks, Wigeon, Geese, Pigeons, Snipes, Plovers, Parrots, Turtles,
Parachites, Machaw’s, with divers others.

[Sidenote: Fruit-Trees and other Plants.]

Choice and excellent sorts of Fruits are here in great abundance, as
_Cocao_-Nuts, _Mannes_, _Maumees_, _Supatas_, _Suppotillias_,
_Avocatas_, _Cashuds_, Prickle-Apples, Pickle-Pears, Sower-Sops,
_Custud_-Apples, and many others.

For Timber-Trees, _Platanes_ and Pines.

And for Garden-Herbs, Radish, Lettice, Parsley, Cucumbers, Melons, _&c._

The antient Inhabitants us’d two sorts of Bread, the one made of stamp’d
Roots, and the other of Corn, which is Reap’d thrice every year, and
grows with such success, that one Pint sow’n yields two hundred.

They had a strange way to make their _Cazari_ Cakes of the Root _Juca_,
which keep good a year: They first press’d out the Juice with great
Weights, which if drunk raw, occasions sudden Death; but boyl’d, is
pallatable and good.

Potato’s are here in great abundance, and grow like Artichokes in a
moist Soil, and shoot forth Leaves of a dark-green Colour, like Spinage;
they spread upon the Earth by Stalks, and bear a Flower like a Bell, at
the end of which grows the Seed: the Roots are generally White, but
sometimes Red, Marble-colour’d, Yellow, and Violet; they are not onely
pleasing to the Pallat, but accounted very wholsom when stew’d in a
close cover’d Pot, with a little Water.

But much daintier are the _Ananas_, which grow on a Stalk of a Foot
long, surrounded with sixteen large sharp Leaves, between which grows a
Fruit like a Pine-Apple, but much bigger, with an uneven Rind, of a pale
Green, and inclining to a Carnation on a yellow Ground; on the top
shoots out a red Bunch of Leaves and Flowers; the innermost Pulp melts
on the Tongue, and is of so delicious a taste, that it exceeds all other
Dainties; the Seed produces Fruit once.

Of this Fruit there are several sorts, the chief whereof is accounted a
special Remedy against a bad Stomach, Gravel, Poyson, and Melancholy.

The Drink made of _Ananas_ is no way inferior to _Malvasia_ Wine.

[Sidenote: A sort of sensitive Plant.]

Here you may observe a remarkable Secret of Nature in a certain
ever-green Plant, which grows either on the Bodies of old Trees, on the
Rocks, or in the Woods; the Stalk whereof surrounded with Leaves, full
of dark red Spots, bears a sweet-smelling Violet-colour’d Flower, the
Leaves whereof as soon as touch’d, close up together and die, and
according as they are held in the Hand a shorter or longer time, this
strange alteration continues.

[Sidenote: Ginger.]

Since the _Spaniards_ planted Ginger on _Jamaica_, it hath grown there
in great abundance; the Male Plant (for it is divided into Male and
Female) hath generally bigger Leaves than the Female; the Stalks, which
are without Knots, have more Leaves upwards than downwards, and spreads
along the Earth, still take Root anew; when the Leaves wither, then the
Ginger is commonly ripe, but it hath not that poinancy whilest green as
when dry’d.

[Sidenote: Cotton.]

The Cotton of this Island (of which the Clothes and Hammocks that are
made, are vended in most parts of the Western World) grows on a Tree of
equal heighth with a Peach-Tree, with a straight Stem or Body, out of
which shoot Boughs of an equal length, and at equal distance; between
the Leaves, which are narrow and long, grow red Flowers, and from them,
oval Cods, which when ripe, inclose the Cotton, and a Seed like Pepper.

[Sidenote: Description of the _Alligator_.]

Of hurtful Creatures here, besides the _Manchonele_, and a sort of
Snakes call’d _Guaana_’s, wherein ’tis thought there is little or
nothing of a poysonous quality; the most observable is the _Alligator_,
with which many Rivers and Ponds abound; it is a very voracious
Creature, but is seldom known to prey upon a Man; it moves swiftly and
strongly forward, but turns slow; the biggest of them are about twenty
Foot long, their Backs scaly and impenetrable, so that they are hardly
kill’d but in the Belly or Eye; they have four Feet or Fins, with which
they go or swim indifferently; are observ’d to make no kind of noise;
their usual course for getting their Prey, is to lie on their Backs as
dead, then with a sudden onset to surprize what-ever Fowl or Beast comes
fearlesly near them; the best caution other Creatures have of them is
from the strong smell that flows from their Bodies: to requite the harm
done by them, they have something of vertue, for the Fat or Oyl of their
Bodies hath been experienc’d to be an admirable Ointment for all kinds
of Pains and Aches; they Lay Eggs no bigger than a Turkies by the Water
side, still covering them with Sand, which heated by the Sun-beams,
hatcheth the young ones, who naturally creep into the Water.

[Sidenote: _Muschilli_ and _Merrywings_.]

In some parts of the Countrey there are also a sort of stinging Flies,
call’d _Muschilli_ and _Merrywings_, but the _English_ Quarters are
little infested by them.

_Hugh Linschot_ writes, That the antient Natives of this Place were a
subtile and sharp-witted People, skilful in Handicrafts, and expert in
warlike Affairs, above all the _Americans_ besides.

[Sidenote: First Discovery of the Island.]

The Island was discover’d by the _Spaniards_ under the Conduct of
_Columbus_, who first built there the Town of _Mellilla_; which
disliking, he remov’d again to _Oristana_; and finding that an
incommodious and unhealthy Situation, he remov’d again to another
Plantation, where he built a very fair Town, first call’d _Sevilla_,
afterwards _St. Jago de la Vega_, consisting of about seventeen hundred
Houses, two Churches, two Chappels, and an Abbey, being the chief, if
not the onely Seat of the _Spaniards_ before the arrival of the
_English_, for their _Estanchas_, or small Plantations, were committed
wholly to the custody of their Slaves.

_Diego_, the Son of _Christopher Colonus_, (or, as he is vulgarly
call’d, _Columbus_) was the first that was constituted Governor of this
Island, and sent _Juan de Squibello_ Commander, who upon their first
arrival here committed such horrid Cruelties and Massacres, that (as the
fore-mention’d _Bartholomeo de las Casas_ writes) five thousand
Inhabitants were in a short time reduc’d to less than three hundred,
multitudes being put to death in a most inhumane and barbarous manner,
some roasted alive, others torn in pieces by the _Spanish_ Dogs, besides
many other studied ways of Butchery, too dreadful to be read with
patience; nor were they free from Civil War amongst themselves, which
first began in this Island.

[Illustration]

[Sidenote: Attempts of the _English_ upon his Island.]

The first and onely Attempters upon this Island since the _Spaniards_
made themselves Masters thereof, have been the _English_, who in the
Year 1592. under the Conduct of Sir _Anthony Shirley_ Landed upon it, &
got clear possession thereof, none of the _Spaniards_ that were then
upon the Place daring to make the least resistance; but not thinking it
worth the keeping, they soon deserted it, and made Sail back again for
_England_: after which they remain’d unmolested for a long time, till in
the Year 1654. a Fleet of _English_ was set out for _Hispaniola_ by
_Cromwell_, under the Command of Colonel _Venables_, with a Design for
the taking of _St. Domingo_; but meeting with ill success in the
Enterprize, and being forc’d to quit that Island with loss of Men, and
frustration of their hopes, they steer’d their Course for _Jamaica_, and
on the tenth of _May_ in the Year abovesaid, with little opposition
possess’d themselves of it. Upon their approach to _St. Jago_ the
Inhabitants thereof deserted it, and betook them to the Mountains,
gaining time by a pretence of Treaty, to secure their Women and Goods;
and oftentimes making Incursions upon the stragling Parties of the
_English_, slew and took many Prisoners by surprize: but being weary of
this wild and irregular kind of living, they betake themselves at last
to the Isle of _Cuba_, where many of them, the Grandees especially, were
permitted by favour to continue, the rest being by the Vice-Roy
commanded back, with promise of speedy and considerable Supplies; by
that time this remnant of the _Spaniards_ was near tir’d out with
hardship and necessity, some being very much discourag’d and driven to
utter despondence of Mind, others destroy’d out-right, part of the long
promis’d and expected Supply arrives, the greatest part being to follow
soon after; but finding the Islanders so few in number, and in so sickly
and necessitous an Estate, they would not joyn with them, but maugre all
the Governor’s Perswasions or Commands, retreat to the North part of the
Island, and there fortifie at a place call’d _Chireras_, expecting every
day fresh Recruits; which not coming time enough, and their Quarters
being discover’d, they were set upon by the _English_, and most of them
either slain or taken Prisoners: not many Moneths after the rest of the
_Spanish_ Forces Land, being in all about thirty Companies, with
Ordnance and good store of Ammunition; who falling presently to make
strong Fortifications at _Rio Novo_, are nevertheless in a short time
utterly defeated by the _English_: Upon which, and several other ill
Successes, despairing to re-gain the Island, they Ship off their Women
and the richest of their Goods; and the _Negro_ Slaves grown Masterless,
by the general either slaughter or departure of their Patrons, shake off
their Obedience to the _Spaniards_, and constitute a Governor of their
own, a _Black_, yet submit themselves, and own Subjection to the
_English_ Government, the _Spaniards_ from _Cuba_, both by their
Perswasions and monethly Contributions, in vain endeavoring to reduce
them; onely some few there were that stood out, whom the rest not onely
made it their business to discover, but help’d the _English_ to take
them, insomuch that at last the _Spanish_ General not having above fifty
Men left him, was forc’d to seek for Peace, and offer’d Terms of
Accommodation; which the _English_ General would not be drawn to accept
of, unless upon Condition that he should deliver up to Justice as many
as were left of those that had barbarously murder’d any of our Men,
either in time of Treaty, or after Quarter given.

The _English_ in this Island are setled for above a hundred Miles along
the Countrey from the Eastward.

[Sidenote: Chief Towns.]

Their chief Towns are 1. _St. Jago_, (built by the _Spaniards_, as afore
mention’d) which lieth six Miles within the Land, North-West from the
Harbor of _Cagway_. Here the _English_ have built a small Fort.

2. _Passage_, a small Town, built also by the _English_ six Miles from
_St. Jago_, for the convenience of going to _Cagway_, consisting of
about fifty Houses and a Fort, whence cross this Harbor, about three
Leagues distant is the Town of 3. _Cagway_, seated on the Extream end of
the Point, containing in it above six hundred Houses, all built by the
_English_, besides the Governor’s Palace, and the Houses where the
Stores for the Army are kept.

This is counted the most healthful Place in all the Island, and the very
Scale of Trade, where all Merchants, Strangers, and Sailors reside.

Here, upon the utmost Angle of the Point towards the Sea, is a round
Tower, built of Lime and Stone; about which is rais’d a strong and
regular Fort, containing sixty pieces of Ordnance.

[Sidenote: _Port Royal._]

This Town is now call’d _Port Royal_, and is thought to contain about
sixteen thousand Inhabitants.

[Sidenote: _Landward._]

A Mile from hence is another Fort, call’d _Landward_, which runs from
the Harbor to the Sea, to defend the Town from any Attempt by Land.

[Sidenote: _Little Island._]

Off the Mouth of the Harbor towards the Sea, lie divers small Islands,
the most Western of which being within half a League of the Fort, and
between which and the Fort every Ship that comes into the Harbor is
necessitated to pass: It is call’d _Little Island_; where a Fort is
likewise rais’d, to defend the Mouth of the Harbor, containing eight
pieces of Ordnance.

Another Fortification is at _Portmorant_, which we shall make mention of
amongst the Harbors.

[Sidenote: Chief Ports and Harbors.]

The chief Harbors of this Island, are 1. _Port Anthony_, on the North, a
very safe Land-lock’d Harbor, onely the coming in is somewhat difficult,
the Channel being narrow’d by a little Island that lies off the Mouth of
the Port.

2. On the East of the Island is _Portmorant_, a very capacious Harbor,
where Ships do conveniently Wood and Water, and Ride safe from all
Winds.

3. On the South is _Port Cagway_, a Harbor wonderfully convenient,
secure and capacious, being five Leagues over in some places, in others
four, and at the narrowest, three; it is Land-lock’d by a Point of Land
that runs twelve Miles South-West from the Main of the Island, having
the great River that comes by _Los Angelos_, and _St. Jago_ running into
it, and divers Springs about it, where Ships do conveniently Wood and
Water. Here is every where good Anchorage, the Road being so deep, that
a Ship of a thousand Tun may lay his sides to the Shore of the Point,
and load and unload with Planks afloat.

4. On the West is _Point Megrill_, a Port very convenient and secure; to
Windward from which, a little North-West, is the Seat of the old Town of
_Mellilla_, founded by _Columbus_, as afore mention’d.

The chief Plantations of this Island, are 1. _Portmorant_, above the
Harbor before mention’d, and by the two Rivers that run into it. Here
are good Plantations of Sugars, Cottons, Tobacco’s, _&c._

2. Hence about ten Miles lieth _Morant_, where a thousand Acres of Land
have been taken up for my Lord _Willoughby_, and a Company of Merchants.

3. Hence farther Leeward lieth _Yallow_, having good Plantations of
Cotton, Tobacco, and other Provisions, excellent _Savana_’s, and some
store of tame Cattel.

4. Thirty Miles hence, on the North side of _Cagway_ is _Ligonce_, where
are excellent Plantations of Sugar, Cotton, and Tobacco, very pleasant
_Savana_’s and some store of wild Cattel.

5. Twenty Miles farther West, nine Miles from the Harbor of _Cagway_, is
_Los Angelos_, having some Plantations of Sugar, _Cacao_, and Tobacco,
all which were old _Spanish_ Plantations, and are less considerable than
those made by the _English_ in other places.

6. Eight Miles from hence, North-West, is _Guanaboa_, where likewise
were some _Spanish_ Plantations, since improv’d by the _English_, who
have very many excellent Plantations of Sugar, _Cacao_, &c.

7. Hence West South-West lieth _Guatabacoa_, a most pleasant rich and
fertile part of the Countrey, abounding with Cattel, and excellent
_Savana_’s. Here the _Negro_’s setled that revolted from the
_Spaniards_, who are endeavouring to make some Plantations of Tobacco’s
and Provisions, and with them are setled some few _English_, who have
divers Walks of _Cacao_.

[Sidenote: The several Governors of the _English_ in _Jamaica_.]

The several Governors of this Island since the taking of it by the
_English_, are as followeth: General _Robert Venables_ staid upon the
Place about three Moneths after the taking of it, and at his coming away
for _England_ he left the chief Command to Major General _Richard
Fortescue_, who liv’d Governor about three Moneths; after which
Lieutenant General _Edward Doyly_ was by the Army elected President; but
upon his coming away soon after for _England_, Lieutenant General
_William Brain_ was sent over Governor in his room; who living in the
Government about three quarters of a year, did as it were bequeathe it
again to _Doyly_, for he was chosen by vertue of a Blank Commission,
wherein _Brain_ had inserted his Name whom he would have succeed, and
remain’d Commander in Chief both by Land and Sea till His Majesty’s
Restauration, and then by His Majesty’s Letters Patents was confirm’d in
the Government, and so was the first that was Governor there for His
Majesty: The next that succeeded was the Lord _Windsor_, upon whose
coming away Sir _Thomas Muddiford_ was sent Governor, and after him Sir
_Thomas Linch_, who remains Governor at present.

                              CHAP. XVII.
                    The Islands call’d the Lucaies.


[Sidenote: Situation and Description of the _Lucaies_.]

Having done with the four Islands of _Barlovento_, as they are term’d,
_viz._ _Hispaniola_, _Cuba_, _Porto Rico_, and _Jamaica_, we come next
to the _Lucaies_, so call’d, as some think, from _Lucaioneque_, one of
the biggest of them; they lie over against _Florida_, Westward from the
_Bermudas_, South-West and North of _Hispaniola_, and the rest of the
_Barloventi_; and because they are but small ones, and lie so near the
Continent, Geographers sometimes describe them as a part, or
appertaining to the Continent. The chiefest of these Islands are
_Lucaioneque_ afore-mention’d, _Bahama_, and _Guanahani_; _Lucaioneque_
is accounted the biggest of them all, and lieth in twenty seven Degrees
between _Bahama_ and _Guanahani_. _Bahama_ lies nearest to the Coast of
_Florida_, and gives Name to the _Straights_ so call’d, which run
between the _Cape_ of _Florida_ and it, with such a violent Course and
Torrent, that although it be above sixteen Miles broad, yet many times
neither Wind nor Oars, can prevail against it; that though the Winds be
prosperous, Ships cannot enter it; and if it be cross, they go with the
Current; yet those _Straights_ the _Spanish_ Fleet must pass in their
Return from the _Havana_ towards _Spain_. _Guanahani_ was the first
piece of _American_ Ground discover’d by _Christopher Columbus_, and
therefore by him call’d _San Salvador_, or _St. Saviour_, because that
thereby he was deliver’d from the mutinous rage of the Seamen, who
threatned to throw him over-board, if they discover’d not Land in such a
time. There are besides a number of small Isles scatter’d up and down,
which are generally comprehended in the number of the _Lucaies_; one is
_Little Island_, encompass’d with a company of Shelves call’d the
_Bimini_, so that it is hardly accessible: there goes a Tradition, that
it hath been inhabited by very beautiful Women, the fame of whom drew
many to attempt to Land there and take up their Habitation; in which
Attempt many were cast away: There is said to be a Fountain in the midst
of it, of such a Vertue, that whosoever drank of the Waters of it, had
their Youth renew’d. Also three Islands, or rather Rocks, call’d _Los
Martyres_, lying to the South-East of _Cape Florida_, and cover’d for
the most part with a whitish Sand and a few Bushes growing on them: they
seem at a distance to bear a resemblance of Men, impal’d, or bound to
Stakes, as the Martyrs in the primitive Times usually were, which
occasion’d the _Spaniards_ so to Name them; ’tis very dangerous to come
too near them, but to have sight of them is of great use to Men at Sea;
for by passing these Rocks, and leaving them on the South-East, they
certainly know, that they are now entred the _Straights_ of _Bahama_,
that is, that they have left the Ocean, and are fall’n in amongst those
many Islands, which do, as it were, Barracado and Block up the Eastern
Coasts of _America_, towards _Nombre de Dios_ and _Terra Firma_, as they
call it, through which the Continent is sometimes dangerous, by reason
of contrary Winds; and always such, that it requires the skill and care
of an experienc’d Pilot to conduct the Ships well thither. The rest are
_Abacoa_, twelve Leagues long; _Yuma_, twenty Leagues in length, and
eight in breadth, between twenty four and twenty five Degrees;
_Yumeata_, fifteen Leagues in length, between twenty three and twenty
four Degrees; _Jamana_, seven Leagues every way; _Yabague_, ten Leagues
likewise, and lying between twenty two and twenty three Degrees;
_Magaguana_, twenty Leagues long, and ten broad; _Quagua_, ten Leagues
every way, and lying between twenty and one and twenty Degrees;
_Caycos_, five Leagues in length, and in the one and twentieth Degree;
_Mackre_, in the twentieth Degree, encompass’d with Shelves; _Abreo_,
environ’d also with Shelves, and fifteen Leagues long; also _Guatao_,
_Cigateo_, _Guanima_, _Jabaka_, _Triangulo_, and several others.

[Sidenote: The _Lucaies_ left desolate by the _Spaniards_.]

On these Islands are no Inhabitants; those that did live there were a
harmless simple People, and therefore the easier taken and carried away
by the _Spaniards_ that have made them so desolate: Many of them seem of
a good Mold, and the Latitude promiseth much fertility. The Air is
certainly good and wholsom, and not so extream hot as other Parts of
that heighth. There is scarce any Beast on them, save a Coney that hath
a Tail like a Rat, but Pigeons and other Birds in great numbers.

There is the Gum _Benjoin_, of the best and worst sort; _Guaiacum_,
_Sasaparilla_, and _Sassafras_; and on some of them Red-wood and
Ambergreece.

Our _English_ Sea-men are little acquainted with these Islands, though
they Sail round them yearly.

[Sidenote: _English_ landing upon them.]

In the time of the Rebellion one Captain _Sail_ and others, obtain’d a
Patent, making thither on the Coast of an Island, which was call’d
_Illutheria_; his Ship was wrackt, but the People recover’d the Shore
with a few Necessaries.

The Coasts of most of them are dangerous, and bad to make, and that Ship
that shall be near or amongst them, must keep the Lead always going; but
with a wary Pilot, and care in giving the Islands a fair Birth, they are
easily recover’d.

The _Spaniards_ know this Place well, and have a yearly Trade thither
for the aforesaid Commodities, and amongst the Islands are Wracks of
divers of their Ships.

                          The Caribby Islands.


[Sidenote: Situation and Names of the _Caribbee_ Islands.]

The _Caribbee Islands_, as they are generally call’d, are a Row or
Ridge, as it were, of lesser Islands, which extend themselves almost in
fashion of a Bowe, from the Coast of _Paria_ as far as _St. John de
Porto Rico_; they are otherwise call’d _The-Caraibes_, sometimes _The
Camercanes_, and by some _The Islands of Cannibals_, or _Man-eaters_,
(though this Appellation cannot in reality be more appropriated to these
Islands, than to many other, either Islands, or Parts of the Continent
of _America_;) lastly, whereas all the Islands between _Florida_ and
_New Spain_, and _Southern America_, are by some comprehended all under
the Name of _The Antilles_; yet the _Caribbees_ and the _Antilles_ are
most generally, and, we conceive, most properly accounted the same; and
they are so call’d, either as lying like a Bar before the greater
Islands, or _Quasi Ant-Isles_, i. e. _Opposites Isles_; they lie all
under the _Torrid Zone_, between the eleventh and nineteenth Degrees of
Northern Latitude, and are twenty eight in number; but before we come to
treat of each of them in particular, we shall take notice of the most
observable of those things which are common to them all in general.

[Sidenote: Temperature of the Air.]

The Air of all these Islands is of a good temperature and healthy, and
the Heat not so excessive in them at any time of the year, as might be
conjectur’d from their Situation under the _Torrid Zone_, by reason of a
gentle East Wind, which rising in the Morning, continues most commonly
till towards the Evening, allaying the scorching heat of the Sun, and
refreshing the Air; but the Nights are commonly very cold; and it is
observable, that by how much the hotter any Day hath been, so much the
colder the Night following happens to be; whereof this reason is given,
That the Vapors rais’d in the Day-time by the Sun, and falling down
condens’d at Night, do very much cool the Air; but it is never so cold
as to Freeze.

For half a year together Day and Night are equal in these Parts, and the
rest of the Year the Day fourteen hours long, and the Night ten.

From _April_ to _December_ there commonly fall here great Rains, and all
that Season is accounted Winter, and the Drought and Heat of the other
Moneths is taken for Summer; but the Woods of these Parts looking ever
green, make as it were continual Summer.

[Sidenote: Nature of the Soil.]

The Soil is generally as fertile as in most places of _Europe_, and each
Island furnish’d with fair Rivers, Brooks, Lakes, Springs, Wells, and
other Sources of fresh Water, besides in many places Mineral Waters,
which are us’d with good success in the cure of several Diseases; also
out of some Mountains store of Brimstone is digg’d, and it is
conjectur’d that there are not wanting Mines of Gold and Silver, if they
were well look’d after; and there hath been often found Crystal upon the
Sands by Rivers sides.

[Sidenote: Vines growing naturally in the _Caribbees_.]

The Vine, though wild, and naturally growing in the Woods, yet yields a
very large fair Grape; and those which are cultivated in their Gardens
or Vineyards, bear excellent Grapes twice a year, but very little Wine
is made of them, in regard they find it will keep but very few days.

[Sidenote: Wheat not apt to grow there.]

Wheat in the _Caribbees_ grows up no farther than the Blade, and the
reason is judg’d to be, because through the rankness of the Soil, and
for want of Winter, this Grain springs up fast, and hath not substance
enough left in the Root to supply it up to maturity; but no doubt but
Barley, Rye, and those other Grains, to the ripening of which more Heat
is requir’d, would thrive there very well.

Besides Lemmon-Trees, Orange-Trees, Citrons, and Pomegranates, and other
Fruit-Trees growing in _Europe_, there are very many sorts of Trees,
Herbs, Pulse, and other Plants, of a different kind from those amongst
us, and peculiar for the most part to these Islands.

[Sidenote: Fruit-Trees.]

Of Fruit-Trees, the most observable are the _Goyavier_, somewhat
resembling the Laurel, onely having a softer Leaf, and of a brighter
Green; its Fruit about the bigness of a Pearmain, but full of little
Kernels like a Pomegranate.

The _Papayer_, which is of two kinds, one generally growing in all the
Islands, the other proper to _Santa Crux_; the first hath a Leaf not
much unlike that of the Fig-Tree, and the other bears a Fruit about the
bigness of a Melon, which by the _Portuguese_ is call’d _Mamao_, from
its resemblance of a Womans Breast: the Tree is hollow and spungy
within, and grows up sometimes to the heighth of twenty Foot.

The _Monick_, call’d by the Islanders _Corsot_, from the Name of an
Island from whence the Seeds were first brought by the _Dutch_, and
bearing a Fruit like a small Cucumber not perfectly ripe.

The _Junipa_, or _Jenipa_, by the _Portuguese_ call’d _Jenipapo_; and by
the _Brasilians_, _Jenipaba_; having Leaves like those of the
Walnut-Tree, Flowers like the _Narcissus_, and a Fruit like a bak’d
Apple, which when it falls from the Tree makes a noise like the Report
of a Gun discharg’d, which is said to proceed from the bursting forth of
the Seed out of the thin Skin enclosing it, and breaking with a
violence; the Juice of it Dyes of a Violet-colour, and the Swine and
Birds that feed upon it, are said to have their Flesh and Fat of the
same colour.

A sort of Vine commonly call’d _The Raisin-Tree_ and by the
_Caribbeeans_, _Ouliem_; whose Fruit being like a large Violet-colour’d
Grape, hath in stead of the several small Grain-stones which are
inclos’d in the Husks of common Grapes, one hard Stone, like that of a
Plumb.

The _Acajou_, bearing for Fruit a kind of Chesnut, in form of a Hares
Kidney, which serves for a Crest to a very fair Apple that by degrees
grows under it, of which the Islanders make a Drink, very much in esteem
amongst them, being of an excellent taste.

The _Icaco_, a kind of small Plumb-Tree, so much coveted, and held for a
Delicacy by some People that live near the Gulf of _Hondures_, that they
are from thence call’d _Icacos_.

The _Monbain_, which Fruit being a kind of yellowish Plumb, is chiefly
made use of to mix in the Drinks of _Ouicon_ and _Maby_, to make them
taste the better.

The _Courbury_ is by some reckon’d to be but a species of the _Monbain_,
onely more full of Leaves, and growing higher and bigger; but the Fruit
of the _Courbury_ is sufficiently different from that of the _Monbain_.

The _Indian_ Fig-Tree, differing in Leaf from the common Fig-Tree, but
whose Fruit both in figure and taste is not much unlike the Fig growing
in these Parts: This Tree is commonly of such a vast Bulk, that the
Branches of some of them have been seen to afford shelter to two hundred
Men.

A kind of Service-Tree, differing from ours, by its exceeding heighth,
fair Leaves, and pleasant Fruit.

The Prickly or Thorny Palm, so call’d from its being arm’d all over with
Prickles, both Trunk and Leaves; by incision into its Branches a sort of
Wine is made, and it is conjectur’d to be the same Tree which the
_Brasilians_ call _Ayry_.

The _Franc_-Palm, an exceeding high and streight Tree, bearing on the
top of its Trunk a whitish marrowy substance, by the _French_ call’d
_Choude Palmiste_, or _Palm-Cabbage_; for being boyl’d with the thin
Leaves that incircle it, and well season’d, it is reckon’d amongst the
Delicacies of the _Caribbees_.

_Latanier_, another kind of _Palm_; and _Cocoa_, which is also reckon’d
amongst the several sorts of Palms; this last is a Fruit-Tree famous all
over _America_, and hath been at large describ’d elsewhere.

There are also many other Trees fit for Dying, Joyners Work, and
Building, (besides the _Acajou_ before mention’d, of the single Trunks
whereof are made those long Shallops call’d _Pyrages_, which are able to
carry fifty Men) as

The _Acomas_, of the same bulk and heighth with the _Acajon_, and
equally esteem’d by Joyners and Carpenters, and of the Fruit whereof the
Woodquists grow fat at a certain time of the year.

The Rose-wood, to be rank’d amongst the chiefest of those Trees that are
made use of by Work-men.

_Indian_ Wood, a very precious and useful Tree for several sorts of
Materials, and of a very fine scent.

The _Iron-Wood_, so call’d from its hardness, weight and solidity, above
all that have hitherto been spoken of, and beyond either Cypress or
Cedar for incorruptibility.

_Brasile-Wood_, so call’d as growing most plentifully in _Brasile_.

_Yellow-Wood_, denominated from its Colour, and much esteem’d for its
usefulness in Dying green Ebony, easily taking the lustre of the true
Ebony, and being very useful for the making of Cabinets and other
curious Pieces of Work; It also Dyes of a very fair Grass-green.

The _Roncon_, by the _Brasilians_ call’d _Urnex_, in the Husks,
succeeding the Flowers whereof, which grow in little Bushes at the end
of the Branches, is enclos’d a most rich Vermilion Dye, of a very soft
and viscous Matter.

Here are also many other Trees, either useful in Medicine, or other ways
advantageous, as the _Cassia_-Tree, of the bigness and figure of a
Peach-Tree; the long Pipes or Cods whereof, containing the Medicinal
Fruit, are well known amongst us by the Name of _Cassia-Fistula_, and to
be had at every Apothecaries.

Medicinal Nuts, each Nut containing three or four Stones in so many
Cells, every one of which is inclos’d within a thin white Pellicle,
pleasant enough to the taste, and out of which is extracted an Oyl, us’d
by the _Portuguese_ in several both Culinarie and Physical occasions.

The Cinamon-Tree, so noted for its aromatick Bark; also _Sandal-Wood_,
_Guaiacum_, and _Sassafras_.

Cotton-Tree and Soap-Tree, whose Uses the very Names imply, and which
Trees have been touch’d upon elsewhere.

The arch’d _Indian_ Fig-Tree, the Bodies of which Trees have been
antiently the sculking Holes and Retreats of the Inhabitants from their
Enemies; the Bark is useful for Tanners.

The _Gourd_-Tree, of the bigness and heighth of a great Apple-Tree, and
of which are made most of the Houshold Vessels and Utensils, which are
in common use at present amongst the Inhabitants.

The _Mahot_-Tree, of the Bark of which are made Laces and Points.

The _Manyoc_, or _Mandioque_, of whose Root the _Cassava_ Bread is made,
and which growing in several places of _America_, hath been already
taken notice of; as likewise the _Banana_-Tree, and that call’d _The
Apple-Tree of Paradice_, otherwise _Adam’s Fig-Tree_, the Fruit being
reported to be of a very delicious taste.

Other Trees not known in _Europe_, are the _Maposu_, divers kinds of
Thorny Wood, the Milky Tree, being of a venomous quality, the
_Mancenilier_, and that whose Root beaten to Powder, and thrown into
Rivers, intoxicates the Fish, with several others of less note.

Innumerable sorts of Shrubs might here in like manner be reckon’d up,
but the chiefest are, That remarkable Plant, anciently known by the Name
of _Ricinus_, and commended for its Vertues by _Galen_ and
_Dioscorides_.

Coral-Wood, so call’d from its little Seeds, which being as red as any
Coral, are us’d for Bracelets.

The _Jasmin_, bearing a Flower of an admirable sweet scent.

The _Candle-Wood_, so call’d from its combustibleness, by reason of an
aromatick Gum which is within.

The Herbs, Flowers, Roots, and Pulse which grow here, are some of them
common in all parts of _Europe_, as Cabbages, Onions, Chibols, Melons,
all sorts of Millets, Cucumbers, Citruls, Parsnips, _&c._

Others, if not peculiar to this Island, yet growing chiefly there, and
in some few parts of _America_ besides, as the _Raquettes_, so call’d
from the resemblance its Leaves have with a Racket, a thorny-spreading
Bush, whose Fruit being of a Vermilion colour, makes the Urine of those
that eat of it as red as Blood. Some liken this Plant to the _Tunas_,
already describ’d, which yields that rich Scarlet Dye call’d
_Cochinele_.

The _Torch_, so call’d by the _European_ Inhabitants; by the Native
Islanders, _Akoulerou_; a great Thistle, or thorny Bush, putting forth
from the middle of it long streight Stalks like Torches, and bearing
Fruit like a great Fig, not unpleasing to the taste.

The _Lienes_, creeping upon the Earth, and spreading up and down like
Ropes, and bearing brown Husks of a Foot long, wherein are enclos’d a
Fruit call’d _Sea-Chestnuts_, of which are made Boxes to keep Snush,
Tobacco, or the like.

A sort of _Sempervivum_, which runs twisting upon Rocks, Trunks of old
Trees, like Misseltoe, and sometimes on the Ground.

A sort of sensitive Plant, call’d by the Inhabitants _Haestiel_, or _The
Living Herb_; of which kind of Plant something hath been already touch’d
upon, and which being transplanted, is kept in several Gardens of the
_Curiosi_ as a Rarity.

The _Sweet-Rush_, whose small Root dry’d, and reduc’d to Powder, helps
Women in Travail.

The _Balisier_, whose Leaf apply’d, mollifies and cools inflammations of
Wounds.

The _Dart-Herb_, whose Root bruis’d and apply’d, draws away the Venom of
empoyson’d Darts; besides _Scolopendria_, a sort of Aloes, several kinds
of Maidenhair, and other medicinal Herbs.

The _Granadilla_, or _Passion-Flower_, growing in several other parts of
_America_, and describ’d elsewhere.

There is also a sort of Pease in some of these Islands, differing from
ours, and call’d _The Pease of Angola_, as first brought from thence.
Likewise a sort of Beans call’d _The Seven-years Beans_, by reason the
same Stalk bears seven years one after another.

The Herb call’d _The Musk-Herb_, from the dusky colour of its Flower,
and the sweet scent of the Seed, grows also in these Parts very
frequent.

The _Pyman_, or _American Pepper_, is the same with that before
describ’d under the Name of _Axi_.

Their _Potatoe_ is a Root not unlike the _Topinambous_, or
_Jerusalem-Artichokes_, otherwise call’d _Saligots_, growing plentifully
in our Gardens, but more wholsome, and of a better taste.

The _Anana_’s, or _Pine-Apple_, accounted a most delicious Fruit, of an
admirable sweet scent, and very pleasant to behold, grow not onely
plentifully in these Islands, but in most places of _America_; besides
the Sugar-Canes here, and in many other places, but not so generally.

The Plant from which is got the Dying Material call’d _Indico_, is very
different from that which grows in _Madagascar_, which bears small
odoriferous Flowers, of a white and purple Colour mix’d together.

Of these Trees, Herbs, and other Plants, which are produc’d in these
_Caribbee Islands_, some are more peculiarly of the Growth of one
Island, some of another; so that we shall have occasion to speak more
largely of some of them, when we come to speak of each Island in
particular.

The four-footed Beasts found in these Islands, are chiefly the
_Opassum_, the _Javaris_, the _Tatan_, the _Agouty_, and the _Musk-Rat_,
which being all of them no less known in other Parts of the _New World_,
have been already taken notice of, and of which we may have also
occasion to treat more at large in the particular Islands, we shall
therefore onely name the other Animals, whether Birds, Reptiles,
Insects, or Fishes, as partly having been heretofore treated of, and
partly to be describ’d hereafter.

The Birds are, the _Fregates_, _Fauves_, _Craw-fowl_, or
_Grandgawsiers_, _Flammans_, _Swallows of America_, _Arras_, _Canides_,
_Parrots_, _Parroquito_’s, _Tremblo_’s, _Sparrows of America_, _Eagles
of Orinoca_, _Manstenys_, _Colibrys_, besides what are common amongst
us, as _Herons_, _Coots_, or _Moor-hens_, _Black-birds_, _Feldivars_,
_Thrushes_, _Turtles_, _Woodquists_, _Pintado_’s, &c.

[Sidenote: Reptiles.]

The Reptiles are, _Anotis_, _Zoquets_, and _Maboujats_ (of which farther
mention will occur in the Isle of _St. Christopher) Globe-mouches_,
nam’d by the _Caribbeeans_, Oulleouma, _Scorpions_, and several sorts of
_Lizards_, call’d by the _Caribbeeans_, Ouamayaca; by the _Brasilians_,
Senembi; and by other _Indians_, Jaquanas.

[Sidenote: Insects.]

The Insects are, besides these common with us, as _Glow-worms_,
_Palmer-worms_, _Spiders_, _Bees_, &c. the _Cucuyos_, mention’d in
_Hispaniola_, and the _Flying Tyger_.

[Sidenote: Fishes.]

The Fishes are, _Sea-Parrots_, the _Dorada_, by some call’d _The
Sea-Bream_, by others, _The Amber-fish_; the _Bonite_, the
_Needle-fish_, the _Epadon_, or _Sword-fish_, the _Marsovin_, the
_Requiem_, the _Remora_, the _Lamantin_, the _Becune_, the _Sea-Urchin_,
the _Sea-Woodcock_, besides _Whales_, and a certan Fish call’d, for its
hideous shape, _The Sea-Devil_, and lastly, the _Sea-Unicorn_, with a
particular Description of which we shall conclude, as having it from
Monsieur _du Montel_, who was an Eye-witness thereof.

[Sidenote: Description of the Sea-Unicorn.]

“This _Unicorn_ (saith he) was pursuing a _Carangue_, or some other
lesser Fish, with such earnestness and impetuosity, that not considering
that it needed a greater depth of Water than the other, it stuck with
half the Body dry on a Sand-bank, whence it could not recover the deeper
Waters ere it was destroy’d by the Inhabitants: It was about eighteen
Foot in length, being at the largest part of its Body about the bigness
of a Barrel: It had six great Fins like the ends of Galley-Oars, whereof
two were plac’d near the Gills, and the other four on the sides of the
Belly at equal distances; they were of a Vermilion red colour: All the
upper part of the Body was cover’d with great Scales, about the bigness
of a Crown-Piece, which were of a blue colour, intermix’d with several
Spangles of Silver; near the Neck the Scales were closer, and of a dark
colour, seeming as it were a Collar; the Scales under the Belly were
yellow, the Tail forked, the Head somewhat bigger than that of a Horse,
and near the same figure: It was cover’d with a hard and dark-colour’d
Skin; and as the Land-_Unicorn_ hath one Horn in his Fore-head, so this
Sea-_Unicorn_ had a very fair one issuing out of the fore-part of his
Head, about nine Foot and a half in length; it was as streight as could
be, and from the place whence it came out it grew smaller and smaller to
the very Point, which was so sharp, that being thrust hard, it would
enter into Wood or Stone, or some more solid Substance; it was at the
place where it came out of the Head, about sixteen Inches about, and
from thence to two thirds of the length it was like a Screw, or, to say
better, made waving like a wreath’d Pillar, save that the Channels grew
smaller and smaller, till they gently ended in a Point, which was two
Inches beyond the fourth Foot: All the lower part had over it an
Ash-colour’d Skin, which was all over cover’d with a small soft Hair,
short as Plush, and of the colour of a wither’d Leaf, but under that it
was as white as Ivory: As to the other part, which seem’d naked, it was
naturally polish’d, of a shining Black, mark’d with certain small white
and yellow Strokes, and of such solidity, that a sharp File could hardly
get a little small Powder from it: It had no Ears standing up, but two
spacious Gills, as the other Fishes; the Eyes were about the bigness of
a Hens Egg; the Ball, which was of a Skye-colour Enamell’d with Yellow,
was encompass’d with a certain Vermilion, which had beyond it another as
clear as Crystal: The Mouth was wide enough, and furnish’d with several
Teeth, whereof those before were extreamly sharp, and those towards the
Throat in both Jaws were broad, and a little knobbed: The Tongue was of
a length and thickness proportionable, and cover’d with a rough Skin of
a Vermilion colour. What was further remarkable, is, that this Fish had
upon the Head a kind of Crown, rising above the Skin about two Inches,
and made oval-wise, the Extremities whereof ended in a Point. Above
three hundred Persons of that Island did eat of the Meat of it, and that
plentifully, and thought it extreamly delicate; It was interlarded with
Fat, and being boyl’d it came up in flakes like fresh Cod, but it had a
much more excellent taste.

“Those who had seen this rare Fish alive, and had with great Levers
broken the Back of it, affirm’d, That he had made prodigious Attempts to
thrust them with his Horn, which he turn’d with an inexpressible
dexterity and nimbleness, and that if he had had as much Water under him
as would have born him up, he would have been too hard for them all.
When the Entrails were taken out, it was found that he liv’d by Prey;
for there were within him the Scales of several kinds of Fish.

“What could be preserv’d of this miraculous Animal, especially the Head,
and the precious Horn fastned in it, hung up near two years at the
Guard-house of the Island, till Monsieur _Le Vasseur_, the Governor of
it, presented one Monsieur _Des Trancarts_ (a Gentleman of _Xaintonge_,
who had given him a Visit) with the Horn. Not long after, coming over in
the same Ship with the Gentleman, who had that precious Rarity put up in
a long Chest, our Ship was cast away near the Island of _Payala_, one of
the _Assores_, and all the Goods were lost, but nothing so much
regretted as the loss of that Chest.”

[Sidenote: The Natives how call’d.]

The Natives call themselves _Cubao-bonon_, that is, _Inhabitants of the
Islands_, and _Caribbeeans_; which last Denomination was not onely
receiv’d amongst the _American_ Isles, but also on the Main Continent of
the _Northern_ and _Southern America_, long before the _Spaniards_
coming thither.

[Sidenote: Their Original.]

[Sidenote: The _Cofachites_ come to Terms of Agreement with the
           _Apalachites_.]

Concerning the original of these People, there are several Opinions; for
those who make them to be Extracted from the _Jews_, have no other
testimony, but that they abstain from Swines-flesh: Those that take them
for a People fled from the great Islands, _Hispaniola_, _Jamaica_,
_Cuba_, and _Porto Rico_, to save themselves from the _Spaniards_
Cruelty, dispute against a known Truth; for who knows not, that the
_Indians_ who escap’d the _Spanish_ Slaughter, have not the least
resemblance either in Language or Customs with the Cannibals? nay more,
they are mortal Enemies to them; besides that, the Cannibals at that
time when _Columbus_ first arriv’d, possess’d those Places which they
now inhabit. The Cannibals seem ignorant themselves in this Point: for
they affirm their Extraction to be from _Guyana_, where the _Calibites_
speak the same Language, and also observe the same Customs and Religion:
The occasion of their removal they ascribe to the King of the
_Arovages_, who made all the adjacent People about his Court, Slaves to
him; which to prevent, they first went to _Tabago_, where being
strengthned by new Comers, they resolv’d to take revenge on him; and
Engaging with him in a Field-Battel, utterly defeated him, and spar’d
none of his Party alive, except the Women; whence it proceeds, that the
_Arovage_ Women have the same Customs and Language with the
_Caribbeans_. But _Bristock_, an _English_ Knight, by long Conversation
experienc’d in the several _American_ Tongues, saith, That the
_Caribbeeans_ have their Original from the _Apalachites_ in _Florida_,
who being a valiant People, destroy’d many of the Natives that inhabited
_Mexico_, that so they might Settle themselves there; to which purpose
they built a City like that of _Apalache_. The _Cofachites_ inhabiting
Northerly, and spread over a barren and Rocky Countrey, made use of this
opportunity to conquer their deserted Habitation: for on a set-time they
set fire to all the Villages, and spoyl’d all things which they could
not carry away with them, that not the least hopes of returning might be
left them; therefore they must either Conquer or Die: which resolv’d
upon, they fell unawares on the _Apalachites_, whose King had
nevertheless so much time, that he Guarded the usual Paths which
directed to the inhabited Villages: But the _Apalachites_ leaving the
common Roads, climb’d over almost inaccessible Mountains, and so got
into the heart of the Countrey, which exceedingly amaz’d _Paracousis_
(for so that King was call’d) who lay Encamp’d at the Foot of a
Mountain, whether the Van of the _Apalachites_ were marching: whereupon
he sending his Army to meet them, they began a most fierce Combat; when
at last both Parties wanting Arrows, they fell upon one another with
Clubs till the Night parted them; and neither could boast of the
Victory. At last this War was turn’d into Peace, and the Articles of
Agreement were these, _viz._

_That the_ Cofachites _should for ever possess the Province_ Amana, _and
become one People with the_ Apalachites, _and acknowledge the King of_
Apalache _for their Chief Governor_.

[Sidenote: They fall off.]

[Sidenote: Are brought to worship the Sun.]

After which the _Cofachites_ were call’d _Caribbeeans_, which signifies
_Accidental Subjects_: But these two sorts of People did not long agree;
for the _Caribbeeans_ sleighted the Customs of the _Apalachites_ in the
Countrey _Bemarin_, and at the same time threw off their Obedience to
the King, chose one _Ragazin_ for their Governor, subdu’d the
neighboring Province _Matika_, and at last defi’d the _Apalachites_; who
inferior to them in Strength, and making use of subtilty, suppos’d it
the best way to make a Difference amongst the _Caribbeeans_ themselves;
to which the Priests freely proffer’d their Assistance, and their Design
prov’d also successful; for the _Caribbeeans_ regarding no Religion
(onely dreading the angry Deity _Mabouya_) the _Apalachite_ Priests
call’d _Jaova_’s, took great pains to perswade their Neighbors to the
worshipping of the Sun; which so prevail’d, that a considerable number
of them ascending the Mountain _Olaimi_, fell down and shew’d Reverence
to that celestial Luminary; which Opportunity _Paracousis_ taking notice
of, caus’d the _Jaova_’s to publish amongst the _Caribbeeans_, That in
the beginning of the _Maairims_, or _March_, a great Feast should be
held in Reverence to the Sun on the usual place, where the King would
Entertain, and give Presents to all the Worshippers thereof.

[Sidenote: The Sun generally worshipp’d by the antient _Heathens_.]

How great a Religion this Sun-worship was antiently amongst the
_Gentiles_, appears from the Writings of several authentick Authors.

The _Syrians_, whose Idolatry the _Israelites_ learn’d, honor the Sun by
the Name of _Babal_, which signifies _Lord_.

The _Phenicians_ call’d the Sun _Beel-samen, Lord of the Heavens_; and
the Citizens of _Accaron_, _Baal-zebahim_, _Lord of the Offerings_; but
God chang’d the Name to _Baal-zebub_, or _The God of Flyes_.

_Moloch_, or _Milcom_ also signifi’d the Sun amongst the _Ammonites_; in
honor of which Children were carried by their Parents, and set between
two great Fires, or else by the Priests, upon pretence of cleansing
them; and sometimes parch’d to death in an Image of _Moloch_, which had
seven Cavities heated like Ovens.

_Macrobius_ tells us, That the _Assyrians_ ascrib’d the supream Command
to the Sun, under the Name of _Adad_, and to the Goddess _Adargatis_,
representing the Image of _Adad_ with Beams darting downwards, and
_Adargatis_ with those that shot upwards: by the first they express’d,
that the celestial Power consisted in Sun-beams, which shooting
downwards warm the Earth; and by the second, that all things by those
Beams were cherish’d and enliven’d.

The most magnificent Temple which _Syria Apamena_ boasted, was
Consecrated to the Sun.

The _Arabians_ Offer’d Myrrhe on the tops of their Houses at the Rising
of the Sun; who also was the _Chamos_ and _Baal-Peor_ of the _Moabites_
and _Medians_.

Near the _Red-Sea_, lay the City _Baisamsa_, which signifies _The House
of the Sun_, famous for the many Feasts which were kept there in honor
of this Planet.

The _Persians_ accounted this Luminary for the greatest God, and
Consecrated to him three several Feasts, looking upon him as the Author
of Wisdom, Goodness, and Power, and is express’d by three several
Operations, _viz._ Warmth, Light, and Distinction of Time.

The _Egyptians_ honor’d the Name of _Osiris_, whom some will have to be
the same with _Misraim_, or _Chamszoon_, the first Founder of the
_Egyptian_ Monarchy.

In _Egypt_ also was famous amongst many other Cities that of
_Heliopolis_, which signifi’d _The City of the Sun_; where the Ox
_Mnevis_ or _Menapis_ being Consecrated to the Sun, was religiously
worshipp’d. This Image is describ’d by _Macrobius_.

The _Moors_ made likewise great Offerings to their _Assabin_, for so
they call’d the Sun; and allow’d their Priests onely the priviledge to
gather Cinamon, and that with this _Proviso_, That they should first
Offer forty four Oxen, besides Goats and Rams, to _Assabin_, nor should
fetch the least Stick of Cinamon either immediately before or after
Sun-set: The Cinamon brought altogether, was to be divided by the Chief
Priest, and the rest having each their Portion assign’d, that which
remain’d was sold to the Merchants, to Trade with into Foreign Parts;
but if the Sun chanc’d to set the Cinamon on fire, then they concluded
they had not dealt justly.

The _Greeks_, according to _Proclus_, hung a long Pole full of Laurel
and Flowers on every seventh day of the Moneth; on the top thereof was a
great Copper Ball, from which hung others still lesser and lesser; about
the middle of the Pole hung three hundred and sixty five Garlands; and
the bottom thereof was cover’d with a Womans Garment of a yellow colour:
The uppermost Ball represented the Sun, the lesser the Stars, and the
Garlands the Days of the Year; in which manner they worshipp’d the Sun.

[Sidenote: Why Divine Worship so generally given to the Sun.]

The same Luminary the _Massagetes_ and old _Germans_ ador’d in antient
times; and to this day the People in the utmost North, _Japanners_,
_Chineses_, _Tartars_, and the _East_ and _West-Indians_, pay their
chief Devotions to the Sun; the reason of which may easily be made out:
for it is the common Opinion of all Men, as _Aristotle_, _Simplicius_,
_Themistius_, and other Heathens witness, to place the Omnipotent
Godhead in the uppermost Orb, which surrounds the Earth; wherefore those
that Pray, lift up their Hands to Heaven: but because the rest of the
Heavens appear not so resplendent as the Sun, therefore they take the
Sun for the onely chief God, whether for its exceeding lustre and glory,
or for its being a hundred and sixty times bigger than the Earth; or for
its swift Course, in running ten hundred thousand Leagues in so short a
time, or for its nourishing and genial Warmth, which gives Life to all
things, or for its necessary Light, by which all worldly Affairs are
manag’d, or for its measuring the Days by its moving from East to West,
and the Seasons of the Year, by a Course from the South to the North;
for all these excellent qualities being well consider’d by the most
Learned _Heathens_, or observ’d by those of lesser Judgment, have made
them shew that Honor to a visible Creature, which is onely due to the
invisible Creator.

These and such like Arguments induc’d the _Caribbeeans_ to go to
_Bemarin_, where the Feast of the Sun was to be kept.

[Sidenote: The _Apalachites_ and _Caribbeans_ make an Offering to the
           Sun on the Mountain _Olaimi_.]

[Sidenote: Part of the _Caribbeans_ revolt from the _Apalachites_.]

[Sidenote: They people the _Caribees_ and grow powerful.]

The _Apalachite_ King also Entertain’d the neighboring People exceeding
courteously in the chief City _Melilot_; from whence he was carried in a
Chair on the Shoulders of four Men, with sound of Pipes and Drums, and
an innumerable company of People, to the top of the Mountain _Olaimi_,
where he made a stately Offering to the Sun, and afterwards Feasting and
Caressing the _Caribbeeans_ with Gifts, he sent them home all well
contented and satisfi’d with their Entertainment. This Custom was yearly
observ’d, when at last they began to neglect their Duty, wherefore
_Toltlabin_ resolv’d to proclaim War against the _Caribbeeans_, if they
did not continue paying their Devotions to the Sun: which Injunction was
differently receiv’d; some judg’d it to be inconsistent with their
purchas’d Freedom, to receive Laws for Religion from a neighboring King,
alledging, That if any Reverence was due to the Sun, it might as well be
given on the Mountains of _Amana_ as within _Toltlabin_’s Realm: others,
who lov’d Peace, and had a zeal to the _Olaimi_ Religion, would not be
against the Proposals, which occasion’d a Contention amongst themselves,
and every one apply’d himself to those that were of his Opinion;
nevertheless those that stood upon their Freedom, were of the greatest
Party; wherefore the Worshippers of the Sun clos’d with the
_Apalachites_, who going out with their Forces, routed the other Party,
and receiv’d those _Caribbeeans_ that joyn’d with them in Religion into
Co-partnership also in the Government, so that they united into one
People: But those that were routed rally’d again, and not without
thousands of Inconveniences made towards the Sea, where Embarquing, they
Landed first on the Isle _Ajay_, now call’d _Sancta Crux_, and in
process of time grew very populous; for from thence by degrees have been
peopled all the little Isles which lie before _America_, and grew so
considerable, that they were sought to by the _Calabites_, to side with
them against the _Arovaces_, _Yaos_, _Sappayos_, and other People their
Enemies on the Main Continent, where they have taken many large
Countreys, extending as far as _Brasile_, where they are greatly
respected and fear’d for their Valor and Policy in warlike Affairs.

But because the memory of antique Passages hath no firm foundation in
Books, having been onely taken by Tradition from time to time amongst
the _Caribbeeans_, therefore we cannot give you an exact Account of
their Removal from _Florida_; yet it remains without contradiction, that
it hapned above five Ages before the _Spaniards_ Arrival, which time at
least was requir’d to the peopling of so many great Islands and
Kingdoms.

[Sidenote: Original of the _Apalachites_.]

Concerning the Original of the _Apalachites_, they themselves affirm,
that they cannot certainly determine the time when they first Setled
here: however, they report that they have peopled the Provinces
_Bemarin_, _Amana_, and _Matika_, many Ages ago. That they are Extracted
from the _Tartars_, appears not obscurely, by their Customs, Idolatry,
and Language. Amongst other things, they have learn’d from the _Tartars_
religiously to remember those Kings which perform’d any grand Exploits
in the Service of their Countrey. Amongst others, the _Apalachites_ make
mention in their _Areitos_, or Songs, of a King call’d _Maydo_, eminent
for his noble Atchievements, and prudent Governing of his People.

[Sidenote: Their opinions in Religion.]

They believe that the Sun many Ages since was Darken’d or Ecclips’d
twenty four Hours together, during which time the Waters over-flow’d the
highest Mountains, except that of _Olaimi_, where there stood a stately
Temple, built in honor of the Sun; in which all those that fled thither
were preserv’d, and dispers’d afterwards into several parts to re-people
the World as soon as the Waters were abated, and the Sun appear’d in his
full lustre again: whereupon they imagine, that to this day their Bird
_Tonatzuli_, at the Rising of the Sun congratulates his appearance with
great joy, and at his Setting, requests his speedy return from under the
Horizon.

[Sidenote: The Bird _Tonatzuli_.]

The _Tonatzuli_ is a Bird like a Bull-Finch, onely its Belly and Wings
are of a Golden colour, the Back and Tail blue, its Head adorn’d with
divers colour’d Feathers, its Claws and Bill like Ivory, and it Sings
like a Nightingale.

[Sidenote: Description of the Mountain _Olaimi_.]

As for _Olaimi_, it is a perfect round Mountain; the Way which leads to
the top thereof runs winding two Leagues long, and is planted on each
side with Cedar, Pine-Trees, _Cassine_, and _Sassafrass_, the top of
which is a fair Plain a League in circumference; Eastward from it is a
Cavern, to which Nature hath afforded more Convenience and Ornament than
could be given to the same by Art and Charges: The first Beams of the
Rising Sun dart into the Cavern, which being oval, appears like a white
Vault, which on the top hath a great Hole for the Air to go in at: The
bottom is like the purest Marble; on the Floor stands a Stone Cistern to
receive the Moisture which drops out of the Rocks. Whilest the People
Danc’d on the fore-mention’d Plain, Feasted and Sung, the Priests
Offer’d Myrrhe, and all manner of Perfumes.

The Clothes which the Rich gave to the Sun, were distributed amongst the
Poor, according to a List which was taken of them.

[Sidenote: The occasion of the _Apalachites_ embracing _Christianity_.]

But in process of time the _Apalachites_ have most of them embrac’d the
_Christian_ Religion; the first occasion thereof was this: When _John
Ribauld_ had brought a _French_ Colony to _Florida_, and gain’d a Fort,
(which from King _Charles_ the Ninth he nam’d _Charles-Fort_) the
_Spanish_ Commander _Peter Melendez_ fell unawares upon him, and so far
impower’d his Men, who had of themselves a natural hatred against the
_French_, that they spar’d neither Man, Woman, nor Child; onely ten Men
escaping the bloody Banquet, fled to the _Floridan_ King _Zaturiona_,
where they were kindly receiv’d, and hearing of the Civility and Power
of the King of _Apalache_ desir’d that they might go thither; which
_Zaturiona_ not onely granted, but also furnish’d the seven _French_-men
(for the other three were dead) with good Guides, who visited
_Zaturiona_’s Relations, living in several Villages along the pleasant
Stream _Selay_, over which they pass’d on large Boughs artificially
joyn’d together, and travell’d through Woods, Marshes, and Mountains
full of ravenous Beasts, and sometimes Engag’d with the stragling
_Floridans_ which lurk’d in the most desolate Wildernesses: having
travell’d two days Journey, by an Ambuscade of King _Timago_’s People,
they lost two of their Guides, the rest being dangerously wounded, and
through many Difficulties came at last to _Avoeka_, and from thence to
the King of _Apalache_’s Court, who receiv’d them all with great
kindness: Whereupon they resolv’d, being induc’d thereto by their
courteous Reception, fruitfulness of the Soil, and good Customs of the
Inhabitants, to Settle themselves, all but two of them, who return’d
with the Guides to _Zaturiona_: the rest that stay’d there, endeavor’d
by promulgating the _Christian_ Religion, to reduce the _Pagans_ to the
belief thereof; which many embrac’d, and also learn’d the _French_
Tongue, notwithstanding their Priests _Jaova_’s oppos’d the same. After
the death of the _French_ (which the _Apalachites_ much bemoan’d) their
Idolatry had like to have gotten the upper hand again, had not some
_English_ Families, fleeing from _Virginia_ from the Cruelties of the
_Indians_, and not able to reach _New England_, Landed at _Florida_,
with intention at first onely to get fresh Provisions, but Rowing up the
River _Selay_, and taken with the pleasantness, they chose the Province
_Bemarin_ for their Habitation, where accordingly they Setled _Anno
1621._ Amongst them were several Learned Men, which so effectually
perswaded the _Heathens_ to embrace the _Christian_ Faith, that in
twenty eight years time the King and most of his Nobles were Converted
and Baptiz’d by them in the chief City _Melilot_.

But since our Design is onely to give you an exact Account of those
People which inhabit the Islands lying before _America_, it is
sufficient that we have shew’d you how they are Extracted from the
_Cosachites_ and the _Apalachites_.

As to the Customs of the _Caribbeeans_, since they are very much alter’d
by their long Conversation with the _Europeans_, we cannot better inform
our selves of their antient Customs, than from those which to this day
are observ’d on _St. Vincent_, and some parts of the Main Continent,
where the _Caribbeeans_ have learn’d nothing from any Strangers.

[Sidenote: Description of the _Caribbeeans_.]

The _Caribbeeans_ are a well proportion’d People with broad Shoulders
and Hips, round Faces, without Beards, wide Mouthes, white Teeth, little
Eyes like the _Tartars_, Feet so hard, that they are almost Dart-proof,
flat Noses, so made by squeezing them down in their Infancy, and long
black Hair. There are few or no deformed People amongst them; all of
them go stark naked, and paint their Bodies Red with a Plant call’d
_Rocou_, and Oyl; about their Eyes they draw a black Circle with the
Juice of the Apple _Junipa_. This their Painting serves them both as an
Ornament, and to make them strong. Others anoint their Bodies all over
with a glewy Stuff, on which they stick all sorts of Feathers. Others
use Gum and Flowers. Moreover, they adorn their Head with Plumes, their
Ears with Fish-bones, or Scales of the _Caret_, or pieces of Crystal,
which they also hang in their Lips and Noses. The Men wear Armlets near
their Shoulders, and the Women about their Wrists; about their Legs they
tie for Garters Strings of Seeds: others take a pride in wearing the
Bones of their slain Enemies, and the Teeth of the _Agouty_, Tygers,
wild Cats, or Cockle shells. When they appear in greatest lustre, then
they wear Armlets under their Arm-pits, and also Scarfs of Feathers,
which either hang over their Shoulders, or are girt about their Middle,
so that one end thereof touches their Thighs. They set an exceeding
value on certain pieces of Copper call’d _Caracolis_, the least of which
they hang in their Ears, and the biggest before their Breasts: and
because they are fetch’d out of the Province of the _Arovages_ their
Enemies, they are esteem’d as Marks of true Valor, and he is highly
esteem’d that wears them.

[Sidenote: Their Language.]

The _Caribbeeans_ which Converse with the _Europeans_, speak two sorts
of Languages, the oldest of which is smooth, acceptable, fluent, and for
the most part spoke between the Lips. According to the several
pronunciations one word hath divers significations: but the Mystery of
their oldest Language they will discover to none. It is very observable,
that the _Caribbeean_ Men speak several words, which though the Women
understand, yet are never spoken by them: and also the antient People
use several Sayings which the younger never mention, and the Youths such
likewise as are never spoken by the Antient, which being spoken apart by
each in the time of War, are understood by none but their Soldiers, that
so their Designs may the better be kept secret. But their mix’d Language
hath many of the _European_ words, especially of the _Spanish_, which
they speak whensoe’re they converse with the _Europeans_. Moreover,
though the _Caribbeeans_ on the least occasion laugh aloud, yet they are
of a dull Spirit, stubborn, and nothing to be got out of them but by
fair means.

[Sidenote: Their Manners.]

Their Employment is Hunting, Fishing, Tilling, Building of Houses, and
the like. Theft is not known amongst them, so that no Man is suspicious
of his Neighbor; wherefore they leave their Huts open both Night and
Day. They are also seldom at Variance one with another, but generally
Love sways amongst them; yet if a Quarrel doth happen, then the injur’d
Person revenges himself to the heighth. Persons that profess Chastity
are much honor’d amongst them; and here Youth bears great respect to
Age.

[Sidenote: Their Ignorance.]

They are also very ignorant in natural Knowledge, insomuch that when the
Moon is Eclips’d, they suppose that it is devour’d by _Maboya_; and
wheresoe’re they smell any ill scent, they believe the Devil to be not
far from thence. Gunpowder they suppose to be a Grain, and are very
fearful of Fire-Arms: Though they have many brave Salt-pits, yet they
use no Salt, nor eat any Swines-flesh, though all those Islands abound
in that sort of Animal, fearing that if they should eat the same, it
would cause them to have little Eyes, which they account very homely,
though it is a property generally incident to them; neither will they
eat any Tortoise, because they would not be so gross as that Creature.
Lastly, they know now no greater Number than they reckon on their
Fingers and Toes, for what exceeds twenty is to them innumerable: They
hold that good Spirits, whom they call _Akamoue_, residing in Heaven,
never trouble themselves with Earthly Affairs.

Their Offerings consist in _Cassave_ and the first of their Fruits,
which are set at the end of their Huts in Vessels on small Tables,
cover’d with Leaves or Rushes, without uttering any Prayers; for they
never Pray but in publick in company of the _Boyez_ or Priests, and that
either for revenge against Injuries, or for recovery from Sickness, or
that they may know the Events of War, or for Protection against the
_Maboya_.

Each _Boye_ hath his peculiar God, which, Singing with a conjuring
Verse, he calls to him in the Night whilst he Smoaks a Pipe of Tobacco.

[Sidenote: Their Fear of the _Maboya_.]

Some have been of Opinion, that this Conceit of the _Maboya_ proceeds
from the phlegmatick Nature of the _Caribbeeans_, who in their
melancholy Dreams imagine themselves to be grievously beaten by the said
_Maboya_. But there are sufficient testimonies to prove, that these
_Heathens_ have often really suffer’d much by this _Maboya_, often
appearing to them in such horrid shapes, that the poor _Caribbeeans_
would sweat and quake at the sight thereof, and inflicting such sad
Pinches and bloody Stripes all over their Bodies, that they liv’d in
perpetual fear of this evil Spirit: and yet notwithstanding these cruel
Sufferings, they shew’d no manner of Worship to _Maboya_, onely they
believ’d that they had some ease, when they wore little Pictures about
their Necks, made resembling the Shapes in which _Maboya_ appear’d to
them; but their best Remedy was to flye to the _Christians_.

[Sidenote: Their Consultations about the Death of any Relation.]

They believe their _Boyez_ able to resolve any Question they ask of
them; particularly, when any one dies, the nearest ally’d to him asks
the _Boye_ this Question, _Who is the occasion of his Death?_ to which
if the _Boye_ names any one, they never rest till they have dispatch’d
him to the other World. Concerning their original brutish way of living,
they give much credit to an ancient Fable, which is to this effect:

[Sidenote: Fabulous Tradition.]

The most antient _Caribbeeans_, living under no other Roof than the
Canopy of Heaven, fed on nothing but what the Fields naturally produc’d,
which salvage Life an old Man much beamoan’d; when a certain Deity clad
in white Apparel descending down on the Earth, said, _That he would have
come sooner to have shew’n them the way of a civil Life, had they
requested it before_. Moreover, the Angel shew’d them a place along the
Shore where there lay sharp-cutting Stones, with which he told them they
might cut down Trees, and with the Timber build themselves Houses, and
cover them with the Leaves of the Palm-Tree to keep out the Rain; which
said, he broke his Staff into three pieces, which being Planted, soon
after produc’d the Root _Manioe_, which stamp’d and dry’d, made good
Bread.

[Sidenote: Their Opinion concerning the Soul.]

The _Caribbeeans_ have also a strange Opinion concerning the Soul, that
is to say, That every one hath as many Souls as he hath Pulses, but the
chiefest is the Heart it self, which after Death removes with _Jeheizi_,
(that is every ones peculiar God or Genius) to the Company of the other
Deities, where they live after the same manner as here on Earth;
wherefore those that are Persons of Quality give Charge at their Deaths,
that their Servants may be kill’d and buried with them, that so they may
serve them in the other World; That the other Souls, which are the
Pulses, are of two sorts, whereof the first call’d _Maboya_’s, range
through Woods and Wildernesses; and the other call’d _The Oumekous_,
reside along the Sea, and over-turn the Ships that Sail by; That the
Souls of Heroes remove to pleasant and delightful Islands, where they
are serv’d by the _Arovages_; That Cowards at their Death go behind a
high Mountain, where they become perpetual Slaves to the _Arovages_.

So soon as they hear a clap of Thunder they run into their Huts, and
place themselves on little Stools round the Fire, cover their Faces, and
laying their Heads on their Knees, make a doleful noise, as supposing
that _Maboya_ is exceedingly enrag’d against them.

[Sidenote: Their manner of Dwelling.]

Their Huts, for the most part built near Rivers and Streams, are of an
oval fashion, their Roofs made of Palm-Tree Leaves or Sugar-Canes, the
Walls nothing but Boughs set in the Ground and pleited together, and the
Floor of sifted Earth or Sand, rammed in and kept very even and smooth;
besides a Room wherein they Sleep and Entertain their Friends, they have
also a Kitchin to dress their Meat, and a place to lay their Bowes,
Arrows, Clubs, and the like, in; they use Mats in stead of Walls, to
separate one Apartment from the other. Their Houshold-stuff is little;
the richest of them have Hammocks in stead of Beds; the meaner sort use
Sticks laid cross one another, and cover’d thick with the Leaves of the
_Banana_-Tree, made fast at the four corners with Cords. Hollow
_Calabashes_, and Earthen Ware call’d _Canaris_, serve them for their
Kitchin Utensils. In the little _Canaris_ they prepare their _Tumalis_,
or _Pepper-pottage_, and in the biggest their Liquor _Ovicou_.

Their Cleanliness may appear by this, that when they go to ease Nature,
they make a Hole in the Ground with a Stick, and after they have done,
stop it up again, burying their Excrement that it may not be seen.

Round about their Huts feed many Hens and Turkies, which they breed not
so much for their own use, as to exchange for Iron.

They remove their Habitations very often, either out of fear of being
haunted by the Ghost of some deceased Person, or to avoid some Smell
which they find noisom and offensive, or because their Hut hath been set
on fire by Lightning.

[Sidenote: Their Houshold Affairs and Diet.]

The Women are always employ’d to keep their Families in good order, to
prepare Venison and Fish for the Mens Tables, to spin Cotton, Comb their
Husbands, and paint them Red. The Men spend their time in the Wars,
Hunting or Fishing. They have also learn’d of the _Europeans_ to burn
Train-Oyl in Lamps in the Night, when as before they burnt Twigs of a
gummy Shrub before mention’d, which for that reason the _Hollanders_
call’d _Candle-Wood_. Each hath a little Stool, and a Table call’d
_Mantoutou_, on which he eats his Meat when he pleases, having no
set-Meals. The broad _Banana_-Leaves serve them for Napkins and
Table-clothes. Their chiefest Dainty is Crabs roasted in the Shell with
the Juice of Lemmon and _Pyman_. At great Feasts they dress their Meat
with the Fat of their Enemies, being the _Arovages_. Their usual Drink
is _Mabby_, made of _Potato_’s, which refreshes, and is good against the
Phlegm; also another Liquor call’d _Oko_ made of steep’d _Cassadar_, and
is like Beer in taste, strength, and colour. They also by making an
incision into the Palm-Trees, tap a Liquor from the same in
_Calabashes_, like White-wine. They use little of the Drink _Couscou_,
because it swells the Body, notwithstanding it is pleasing to the
Palate; But the Liquor which is most esteem’d amongst them, is the Wine
made of the Sugar-Canes, which are squeez’d in Mills made for that
purpose, and then boyl’d in great Kettles. During the dressing of their
Meat (which being done leisurely, is sometimes half a day before it is
ready), they Sing, and Dance to the Time, which one keeps with a
_Calabash_ fill’d full of little Stones, in which they believe the
greatest happiness they shall enjoy in the other World consists: But the
_Caribbeeans_ never Dance more antique than when they meet in the
_Carbet_, which is a publick House of Entertainment; whether the Women
carry a Drink made of _Cassave_, which makes Drunk as soon as Wine: The
Men bring Fish and Hedge-hogs; all of them painted with _Roucou_, and
adorn’d with Plumes of Feathers, commit all manner of Debaucheries. At
other times they also keep Feast-days, which is either when they are
preferr’d to some Office, or Place of Honor, or when they have defeated
their Enemies, or when they mourn for the Death of one of their nearest
Relations.

[Sidenote: Their Beasts.]

Their Boats, which they call _Periaquo_’s, are made of single hollow
Trees, full of Benches, and painted with several strange Shapes, and are
able each to carry fifty or sixty Men.

[Sidenote: Their Musical Instruments.]

Their Musical Instruments in which they take most delight, are Drums,
Strings of Silk-grass stretcht upon _Calabashes_, and Flutes made of the
Bones of their Enemies.

[Sidenote: Their watchfulness against Enemies.]

[Sidenote: Their Entertainment of Friends.]

They keep Watches on high Hills, to descry the Ships off at Sea, and no
sooner have they espy’d one, but they immediately give notice to one
another; whereupon those that are most valiant put off to Sea in their
_Canoos_ and know by the Languages to distinguish between a _Spaniard_,
_French_-man, _English_-man and _Hollander_. If they find that ’tis an
Enemy who Lands on their Coasts, they guard all their Avenues, lie in
Ambuscades, and gather together in by-ways, and where they see any
advantage they shoot thousands of Arrows; which done, they fall in
amongst them with great Clubs: but if they chance to be defeated, then
they lurk behind Bramble-bushes, or climb up inaccessible Mountains, or
else, if near the Sea, they save themselves by Diving and Swimming under
Water above two hundred Paces before they appear again; and if a Party
of them chance to meet together afterwards, they venture a second
Engagement; But if those that come on their Coasts are Friends, they
Swim, or go in their Boats to meet them, climb up their Ships, and carry
the Sea-men on their Shoulders ashore, where the _Casique_ in the Name
of the whole Island bids them welcome, and conducts them to the
_Carbet_, where an antient Man salutes the old Men, and a Youth the
young Men; after which asking their Names, the _Couban_ calls himself by
that Name ever after; and desires the Strangers to accept of his Name;
during which their changing of Names they use many Ceremonies of
Friendship: this done, they proffer them Cotton Hammocks to rest
themselves in, and pleasant Fruit to eat, till they have prepar’d other
Meat; which is no sooner Ready, but a little Table is set before every
one of them, and a Dish of Meat consisting of boyl’d Hedge-hogs, boyl’d
Crabs, and Pot-herbs; which if the Guests do not eat heartily, or drink
up all the Liquor which they give them, they take it as a great Affront;
but if they eat and drink heartily, they take it kindly, and shew great
sorrow at their departure.

Their Offices of Government have been usually three; the meanest
belong’d to the _Tiouboulihauthe_, whose Place was to Govern over the
_Carbet_, a House where Strangers were Entertain’d, Matters of War
disputed of, and publick Feasts kept. _Tiouboutonti_ Commanded the
_Canoos_ in the time of War, that is, under the _Nahalene_, who
Commanded the whole Fleet: But the chiefest Officer of all was the
_Ouboutou_; to which degree of Honor none attain’d, unless he had kill’d
several _Arovages_, or at least a Governor.

When the _Caribbeeans_ drew all their Forces out of the Islands to a
Battel, then they chose one out of the _Ouboutou_, who during their
March Commanded the Army as General, which his Office ended with the
War, and extended no farther than his own Island.

[Sidenote: Their warlike Consultations.]

Their warlike Consultations were no less observable for the _Ouboutou_
appointed a Day, on which the Islanders met at a Feast in the _Carbet_,
whither they accordingly came all at the time appointed, and having Eat
and Drunk, and Danc’d a considerable time, an ancient Woman with tears
in her Eyes, and mournful Countenance enter’d the _Carbet_, and desir’d
Audience; which being granted her, and every one silent, she began to
relate the Damages which from antient times the _Arovages_ did to the
_Caribbeeans_; and that in the last Engagement so many valiant Men were
slain, and afterwards devour’d by them; therefore it would be a shame
not to take Revenge, which being seconded by the _Ouboutu_, put Valor
into the Hearts of all that were present: Whereupon the following day
Messengers were sent to the other Islands to acquaint them with their
Intentions, that they might prepare their Clubs, make sharp and poyson
their Arrows, String their Bowes, prepare Provisions, and fit out their
_Canoos_: They poyson’d their Arrows with the Juice of _Manchenillo_’s,
which made the least Wound mortal. Their Provisions and Arms they laid
up in their _Canoos_, so to preserve their _Periaguo_’s (which are Boats
that can carry fifty Men), if they should chance to over-set, which
often happen’d, though they were soon turn’d up again. They went from
one Island to another, where they not onely stor’d themselves with fresh
Provisions, but increas’d their Fleet with new Assistants; with which
approaching the Main, they hal’d their Boats ashore in the Evening, and
driving four Stakes into the Ground under the Trees, made fast their
Hammocks to the same, in which they slept till Mid-night, and then fell
on their Enemies, but if discover’d by them, they retreated to their
Boats and return’d home; but if they were not discover’d, they fell upon
the Huts of the _Arovages_; who resisting, they shot Arrows with burning
Cotton into them, and so setting them on fire, forc’d the _Arovages_ to
venture a Battel in the open Field; where having spent all their Arrows,
they Engag’d one another with great Clubs, with which at one Blow they
broke either Arms or Legs, or knock’d out their Brains. If the
_Caribbeeans_ chanc’d to be defeated, then those that remain’d of their
Party made a lamentable noise, howling for those that were kill’d, and
mix’d their Tears with the Blood of their slain Friends, whom not
without the greatest danger they fetch’d from amongst their Enemies, and
carried them aboard their Boats: But returning Victors, the were wont to
insult over their Prisoners with all the bitter Taunts imaginable, and
then taking advantage of those sharp Upbraidings which their cruel usage
extorted from them, to put them to death with most inhumane Tortures,
and then to Feast themselves upon their mangled Bodies, all claiming a
Right to their several Prisoners, as to so many Beasts appointed to the
Slaughter; But of late Ages they have contented themselves to dispatch
them speedily with their Clubs, and so assign them to their Shambles.

[Sidenote: Their Enmity to the _Spaniard_.]

As the _Arovages_ had been formerly, so the _Spaniards_ at length became
the Object of the _Caribbeeans_ irreconcileable Hatred, insomuch that
oft-times being Invaded by them, they gave them such rough
Entertainment, that they were glad to save themselves by flight; for the
_Caribbeeans_ not regarding their Guns, press’d upon them, and many
times took Vessels richly laden from them, till of late years that a
Peace hath been concluded between them; wherein nevertheless those of
the _Caribbeeans_ refuse to be concern’d, that inhabit _St. Dominico_
and _St. Vincent_, who cannot to this day forget the cruel Outrages
committed by the _Spaniards_.

[Sidenote: Their Marriages.]

To come to their Marriages, they were allow’d as many Wives as they
pleas’d to have, insomuch that their Governors were in esteem according
to the number of their Wives; nor were degrees of Consanguinity so
regarded, but that an Uncle might take his Neece; whom he no sooner had
carried to his House, but the Marriage was finish’d. They seldom
Divorc’d their Wives after they had bore them Children, but otherwise
the Man would break the Bond of Matrimony when he pleas’d. A young Man
that had no Relation might court a Stranger, and if her Parents allow’d
of it, the Match was made. One that had behav’d himself valiantly
against the _Arovages_ was sure of several good Matches, for he was
refus’d by none whom he Courted; and the abundance of Wives was the
greatest testimony of their Valor. Each Wife had a peculiar Dwelling, so
to prevent all Dissentions: So soon as one of them was with Child, her
Husband Lay not with her till after Delivery. If any Woman committed
Adultery, her Husband was permitted to knock out her Brains, or rip open
her Belly; which done, he acquainted her Father with the Deed, who
return’d him thanks for the same. Murderers were either burnt or cut in
pieces. Children were born here with little trouble, for the Women were
no sooner Deliver’d, but they carried the Infant to wash at the next
Brook; which done they return’d home to their Houshold Labor, whilest
the Man on the contrary kept his Bed, and ate nothing but a piece of
_Cassava_ Bread, which he hollow’d out in the middle, and left the edges
till the Feast, which was kept at the Naming of the Child: Moreover, he
fed on all manner of Dainties for a whole year after. But this Custom
was observ’d onely at the Birth of the first Son, at which time they
scratch’d the Father’s Shoulder with a sharp Curry-combe, at which if he
flinch’d not, it was accounted a good Omen of the Childs future Valor.
At fifteen days old they made Holes in the Childs Ears, Lips, and
Nostrils, through which they put a String for the tying on of what-ever
Ornamentals. With the like Ceremonies the Child receiv’d a Name, taken
from his Predecessors, Trees, Fishes, or some remarkable Passages during
the Mothers bearing of the Infant in her Womb, or of the Father’s
Lying-in: But this Name was chang’d so soon as they went to War, or
kill’d a Commander of the _Arovages_, whose Name they exchang’d for
their own: After which the Mothers took special care in bringing them
up, and at six Moneths the Children were able to run alone: When they
attain’d to the age of two years, they cut off their Hair, at a great
Feast made for that purpose; from which time forward they exercis’d them
in Shooting with Bowes and Arrows; to which purpose they hung up pieces
of Meat for them to shoot at, which they must either hit down, or Fast.

[Sidenote: Initiation of Soldiers.]

Their Ceremonies to make Soldiers were very strange, _viz._ The Father
conducted his Son to the _Carbet_, where he told him the Duties of a
Soldier, beat him with a Bird of prey, call’d _Mans-fenis_, till he had
bruis’d the Head of the Bird, and scratch’d his whole Body all over with
a Curry-combe till the Blood came, and then put Lemmon Juice into the
Wounds, afterwards put him in a Hammock, and hung him up for several
days without giving him any Meat; all which Torments and Trials if he
endur’d with patience, then he was accounted a good and approved
Soldier.

[Sidenote: Of their Priests.]

Few bred up their Children to be _Boyez_ or Priests; yet those that were
brought up to it, abstain’d from certain Food from their Infancy, and
before they could be receiv’d into the Order of Priesthood, they were
forc’d to draw Blood from every part of their Bodies.

[Sidenote: Great age of the _Caribbeeans_.]

The _Caribbeeans_ attain to an exceeding great Age: _Charles de
Rotchfort_ witnesseth, That in his time there liv’d Men who remembred
the first Arrival of the _Spaniards_ under the Command of _Christopher
Columbus_, which consider’d, they could not be less than each of them a
hundred and sixty years old. Many Women also were found there, who bare
Children after they were eighty years of age: yet nevertheless they are
not free from Sicknesses and Distempers, which cannot justly be
attributed to the Climate, that being extraordinary healthful, but to
their ill Diet. Besides the troublesom Disease call’d _Pyans_, which
makes their Bodies swell full of great Knobs, they have been much
troubled with pestilential Sores, occasion’d by the eating of Crabs, and
poysonous Tortoises, _Lamantins_, and Hedg-hogs. Against which Evils
they wanted not Medicines, consisting of Herbs, Roots, Gums, and Oyl.
The bitter Bark of the _Chipiou_-Tree, steep’d in Water, and mix’d with
_Lanbys_, hath a soveraign operation. The like vertue is in the Juyce of
the _Myby_-Tree, which they us’d to take inwardly: and for outward
Means, they us’d a Salve made of burnt Cane-ashes, temper’d with a Water
press’d out of a certain Tree. To draw the Matter out of the Sores, they
us’d the Juice of _Junipa_. Letting Blood was never customary amongst
them, but to cut and scratch the sore part was to them in stead of
Phlebotomy. But if all the fore-mention’d Medicines would not help them,
they fled for aid to the _Boyez_, who immediately order’d the Hut
wherein the Patient lay to be made clean, the Table call’d _Matoutou_ to
be over-spread with _Cassave_, _Ouycou_, and Garden Fruits, for an
Offering to the evil Spirit _Maboya_, and as many Stools to be plac’d
about the same as there were People to be present at the Ceremony; and
after that all the Fire and Candles were put out, the _Boye_ enter’d
into the Hut about Midnight with a Lighted Roll of Tobacco, then
muttering some words to himself, stamp’d with his left Foot, and blew
the Smoak of the Tobacco up into the Air, which done, and tearing the
Tobacco in pieces, he threw the same over the Hut, and call’d up his
Spirit, who shaking the Roof of the House, made a terrible noise; then
the _Boye_ drew near to the Patient, suck’d his Sores, and anointed them
with the Juice of _Junipa_; after which if the sick Person recover’d, he
made a great Feast, and an Offering to the aforesaid Spirit: But if the
Distemper were mortal, then the _Boye_ inform’d the Patient’s Relations,
That his Spirit had compassion upon the Sick, and was resolv’d to carry
him above the Stars, to accompany the other Gods which reside there.

Thus much in general of the Inhabitants of the Isles that lie before
_Northern America_; it will next be requisite to give you an Account of
them in particular.

[Sidenote: The number of the _Caribbee_ Islands.]

[Sidenote: Their several Names.]

There are generally reckon’d of these Islands twenty eight by Name,
though there are many more in number; for besides that there are a
multitude of small obscure Islands that are not nam’d, there are of the
more considerable sometimes two or three that go under one Name; the
twenty eight are these following: _Anegada_, _Sombrero_, _Las Virgines_,
_Anguilla_, _Saba_, _St. Crux_, _St. Martin_, _St. Bartholomew_,
_Barbouthos_ or _Barboude_, _Rotonda_, _Nevis_, _Eustathius_, _Antego_,
_Montserrat_, _Guadalupe_, _Deseado_, _Marigalanta_, _Todos Sanctos_,
_De Aves_, _Dominico_, _Martinego_, _St. Lucia_, _Barbados_, _St.
Vincent_, _Bekia_, _Granada_, _Tabago_, _St. Christopher_.


                               SECT. II.
                         Anegada and Sombrero.

[Sidenote: Situation of _Anegada_ and _Sombreros_.]

[Sidenote: The _Mansfeny_.]

[Sidenote: The _Colibry_.]

Towards the North-East of _Porto Rico_, at eighteen Degrees and thirteen
Minutes, lies _Anegada_, seven Leagues long, surrounded with Shoals and
Banks, as also the neighboring _Sombrero_, being in the same Latitude
with the other, and so call’d by the _Spaniard_, because it appears like
a Hat: Both of them being uninhabited, harbor abundance of Birds,
amongst which is the _Mansfeny_, a little Eagle, and the remarkable
_Colibry_, whose Body being a little bigger than a _Wren_, is adorn’d
with divers colour’d Feathers, resembling a Rain-bowe; about its Neck is
a Carbuncle red Circle; the Belly and ends of the Feathers are of a
Golden colour, the Sides of an Emerauld green, the Bill and Legs black
like polish’d Ebony, the Eyes glittering like Diamonds, on the Head a
curious green tuft of Feathers: the Cocks far exceed the Hens in beauty;
they flie swifter than any Bird whatsoever, and the fluttering of their
Wings makes a noise like a Whirlwind: they live upon the Juice of
Flowers, and especially of Cotton-Flowers; they smell like Amber, and
build their Nests amongst the thick Leaves of a little Bough, where they
cannot easily be found; the Nest it self open towards the South, is
curiously made of the fine Fibres of the Plant _Pite_, surrounded with
pieces of Bark, and within fill’d with Cotton, douny Feathers, and Silk;
the Eggs oval, are somewhat bigger than an ordinary Pearl.

[Sidenote: _Painted Crabs._]

In the Moneth of _May_ that sort of Crabs call’d _Painted Crabs_ (for
some have Violet-colour’d Shells, others yellow, full of purple Specks,
and others tawny, with red Streaks) come creeping down the Hills in good
order, eat up all the Herbs and Plants, and go four times one after
another into the Water to wash themselves, which done they return to the
Woods; but the Females at a set-time betake themselves to the Sea, in
which they Lay their Eggs, which afterwards being cast on the sandy
Shore, and warm’d by the Beams of the Sun, produce young Crabs in a
short time, which no sooner come out of the Shell, but creep towards the
Woods, when grown somewhat bigger they climb up the Rocks, where the old
ones keep in vast multitudes, and stop up the Entrance of their Holes in
such a manner, that they cannot be found out, whilest they cast off
their Shell, creeping out backward through an opening at the Tail scarce
discernable; thus for a certain time they lie bare, and stript of their
Shells, being onely cover’d with a thin Skin, which growing harder and
harder, becomes at last a firm Shell like the former.

These Crabs are a wholsom Meat, unless they feed under the
_Mancheneel_-Trees, which commonly are poysonous.


                               SECT. III.
                             Las Virgines.

[Sidenote: Situation of _Las Virgines_.]

Near _Sombrero_, at eighteen Degrees, lie also the two Isles _Las
Virgines_, surrounded by ten others (and flat Shelves), without Trees or
fresh Water; but the Sea thereabouts abounds with Fish, and chiefly with
the _Perroket_, which hath Scales like a Carp, but greenish; the Eyes
surrounded with Silver Circles shine very bright; in stead of Teeth they
have strong Jaw-bones, wherewith they Grind all manner of Shell-fish,
which are their Prey. These Fish have an excellent Rellish, and weigh
generally twenty Pound.

[Sidenote: The Fish _Dorade_.]

Here is likewise great plenty of the _Dorade_, which is a very large
Fish, and about five Foot long, full of little Scales, with a prickly
Back, two Fins at the parting of the Head, and as many under the Belly.
This Fish swimming very swift, oftentimes follows the Ships that Sail
that way.


                               SECT. IV.
                               Anguilla.

[Sidenote: Situation of _Anguilla_.]

Southward at eighteen Degrees and twenty Minutes, on this side of the
Line, appears _Anguilla_, inhabited by the _English_, containing ten
Leagues in length; It makes a pleasant Prospect, because of the many
_Junipa_-Trees which grow upon the same, whose Boughs bend towards the
Ground; the Leaves are not unlike those of an Oak; the Flowers both in
smell and shape come near the _Narcissus_; the Wood firm and grey, may
be neatly Plan’d; the Tree bears fresh Leaves every Moneth, and a Fruit
like Apples, which generally crack in their fall from the Tree, because
of their thin Shell, as hath been already describ’d.

[Sidenote: _Oculiem_ a sort of Vine]

The _Oculiem_, or Vine, makes the Shore also very pleasant; the Leaf
round and thick, hath a mixture of Red and Green; the Bark incloseth a
Violet-colour’d Wood; the Boughs whereof are loaded with Violet Grapes,
which in stead of Kernels contain hard Stones.


                                SECT. V.
                                 Saba.

[Sidenote: Situation of _Saba_.]

Westward from _Anguilla_, at seventeen Degrees and thirty five Minutes,
lies _Saba_, which shews at a great distance like a Rock. The
Inhabitants of _St. Eustathius_ going thither, found a pleasant Valley,
able to maintain many Families.

The Sea about this Island is so clear, that a Stone may be seen lying on
the bottom of it.

[Sidenote: The Fish _Bonito_.]

Amongst many other sorts of Fish, the _Bonito_ is the most remarkable,
which is thick and fleshy, two Foot long, with a dark green Back, and
white Belly without Scales; It devours greedily all manner of Carrion.


                               SECT. VI.
                               St. Crux.

[Sidenote: Situation and first Plantation of _St. Crux_.]

North of _St. Christophers_, in eighteen Degrees and some Minutes, lies
_St. Crux_, which the _Caribbeeans_ who were beaten by the
_Apalachites_, first inhabiting, call’d _Ayay_, where _Columbus_ found
great opposition, for the Women themselves shot poysonous Arrows at the
_Spaniards_; and before the Islanders submitted to them, they took many
_Spanish_ Ships, burnt their Villages, and flay’d many of the
_Spaniards_ alive. The Soil, though Hilly, is rich and fruitful.

The _English_ Landing here _Anno 1587._ found a standing Pool, whose
Water made swell the Faces of those who wash’d themselves with the same
before Sun-rising, in such a manner, that they were not able to see for
several days after; but they at last found a Fountain of wholsom Water.

[Sidenote: The several Changes of Dominion in this Island.]

Since the _Spaniards_ destroy’d the Inhabitants of this Island, it lay
desolate for a considerable time, notwithstanding it hath fourteen
Leagues in length, and little less in breadth, till at last the
_English_ and _Hollanders_ took possession of the same, each in a
peculiar place; but not agreeing together, the _English_ fell upon the
_Hollanders_, and made themselves Masters of the Island in 1649. and not
long after they were serv’d in the same kind; for the _Spaniard_ judging
them to be weakned by the _Hollanders_ removing from the Island, set
Sail thither from _Porto Rico_, burnt all the Houses, slew the
Inhabitants, and brought _St. Crux_ again under the _Spanish_
Government. Mean while the Lord _Poincy_ fitted out two Sail of _French_
Ships, to drive the _Spaniards_ from _St. Crux_, and succeeded in his
Enterprize; for the _Spaniards_ immediately fled to their Ships, left at
liberty some _Holland_ Prisoners whom they had taken, and the Island in
possession of the _French_; who straightway sent Captain _Auger_ thither
as Governor, who design’d to build a Fort to secure the Harbor, but died
before the same was finish’d. _Poincy_ succeeding him, made an end of
the Fort, and stor’d the Island with Ammunition and Provision. The
Cross-Church built there by the Order, and at the Cost of a Company of
_Flushing_ in _Holland_, was deliver’d also to the _French_.

[Illustration: DE STADT ST. Martin]

[Sidenote: Fruit-Trees.]

The Trees which grow here are of four beneficial kinds, serving for four
several uses; some yield Fruits of a pleasant taste, and wholsom to eat;
some excellent Medicines; others Timber for Building; and others Stuff
to Dye with.

Granates, Oranges, Lemmons, and Citrons, grow better here than in any
place of the World.

[Sidenote: The _Papaye_.]

But the _Papaye_-Tree is particularly worthy of our Description; It
grows twenty Foot high, without Boughs, thick and streight, hollow and
spungy within, bears three-corner’d Leaves hanging on long Stalks,
hollow in the middle, and of a Fingers thickness; on the top round about
the Body of the Tree, grow a sort of Fruit like Quinces.

This sort of _Papaye_-Tree grows on most of the _Caribbee Islands_; but
the second sort call’d _Mamoa_, is to be found no where but on _St.
Crux_; it hath more Leaves than the first, and a yellow Bark with green
Streaks, within full of round and sharp biting Grains; the Blossoms
thereof yield a sweet smell; every Moneth the Tree produces new Fruit,
not unlike a Womans Breast (whence it hath its Denomination as before
observ’d,) and rellishing incomparably well.


                               SECT. VII.
                              St. Martin.

[Sidenote: Situation of _St. Martin_.]

Not far from _St. Crux_, at eighteen Degrees and sixteen Minutes, lies
_St. Martin_, which hath seven Leagues in length and five in breadth,
and is famous for many excellent Salt-Mines; to preserve which, the
_Spaniards_ built a City and Fort there.

[Sidenote: The _Dutch_ Land there.]

_Adrian Peter_ and _Martyn Thyszoon_, sent with eleven Sail of Ships
from the _Texel_ by the _West-India_ Company, to Cruse for the _Spanish_
Plate-Fleet before the _Flemmish_ Isles, finding their labor lost,
Steer’d to the Inlet of _Todos los Sanctos_; where finding no Enemies
Ships, they Sail’d along the Coast of _Pernambuck_, and from thence
(meeting with no Prize) to the _Caribbee Islands_; and Landing on
_Granada_, receiv’d some damage from the Inhabitants: thence going to
_Blanca_, they got above a thousand Goats, and ten thousand Lemmons from
_Hispaniola_; near _Cuba_ they were surpris’d with continual Thunder,
Showers, and Storms, which forc’d them to stand to and again off the
Island a considerable time, where they thought to wait for the _Spanish_
Ships that came from _Nombre de Dios_; but being defeated of their aim,
by reason that Fleet was re-inforc’d with a considerable Supply, they
set Sail _Anno 1629_. towards the City and Fort of _St. Martin_, where
coming to an Anchor they found the Place in this condition: On the right
side of the City glides a fresh-Water River, with many meandring Streams
from the Mountains; on the left side the Ocean makes a great Opening or
Bay, which for a little space growing narrower, becomes at last an
Inland Lake; from the Countrey opposite to the City on the other side of
the fore-mention’d Inlet, runs a Ridge of Hills toward the Sea; on the
utmost Point thereof stands a square Fort, defended from the force of
the Water with great Stones, pyl’d up at the Foot thereof, cover’d like
a House, having on the top of it a Watch-tower, and not far from it a
Chappel; moreover, the Mountain _Calvaria_, rises on each side and
behind the City, with high Precipices; not far from the Mouth of the
River appears a strong Castle with several Bulwarks, and thereon great
Guns; along the Inlet is a fair Market-place; in the middle of the City
stands a Church Consecrated to _Dominicus_, near which there is a large
Hospital, which fronts the Sea; the Cathedral stands at the farther end
of the City, and on the declivity of a Mountain a fair Chappel; near the
great Fort the Governor hath a pretty Palace; nor are the _Franciscan_
Cloysters much inferior to any of the other Structures of this City,
which taken altogether bears a good Form, by reason of the uniformity of
the Streets.

[Illustration]

[Sidenote: The Island possess’d by the _Dutch_.]

But _Anno 1648._ the _Spaniard_ totally deserted this Island, which
_Michael Adriaenszoon Ruiter_ hearing of, brought several People from
_St. Eustathius_, and took possession of it in the Name of the _States_
of the _United Netherlands_: Yet they enjoy’d not long the entire
Propriety, for the _Spaniards_ again went and claim’d those Places which
were theirs upon the first gaining of the Island; which the _Hollanders_
allowing them, they liv’d peaceably and quietly together, each having
their own Churches, Store-houses, Land, and _Negro_’s. The _Dutch_
Plantation was maintain’d by the _Zealand_ Lords, _Lamsen_ and _Van
Ree_.

There are divers Pools of salt Water in this Island, which afford the
Inhabitants store of Fish, and especially Tortoises.

The Woods produce wild Hogs, Pigeons, Turtle-Doves, and Parraquito’s
resembling a Parrot, and which though much smaller, are more apt to be
taught.

[Sidenote: _Flammans._]

Near the Salt-pools also breed Birds call’d _Flammans_, not unlike a
Jack-daw, onely differing in Feathers, for they are first white, next
ash-colour’d, and at last turn red; they seldom flye or sit alone, but
for the most part in great Flocks in open places, and Moorish Grounds;
when some of them seek for their Food under Water, one of them stands
Centinel, and on the least noise or appearance of a Man, gives notice by
Chirping to the rest, who hereupon immediately flee away; those that
shoot them lie commonly hid under an Ox Hide.

[Sidenote: _American_ Swallows.]

About the same Pools breed likewise the _American_ Swallows, with
crooked Bills, Feet like Ducks, black Bodies, white Bellies, and long
Tails.


                              SECT. VIII.
                            St. Bartholomew.

[Sidenote: Situation and Description of _St. Bartholomew_.]

Near _St. Martin_, at sixteen Degrees, lies the Island _St.
Bartholomew_, which being about five Leagues in circumference, is
surrounded with Rocks, and was first Planted by _De Poincy_: It makes a
delightful Prospect, because of the many Trees which grow on the same;
amongst which the most noted are Soap-Trees, whose Wood makes the Water
Lather, and washes as well as Soap; but they are of two sorts, for in
some this soapy Quality is contain’d in a round yellow Fruit, not unlike
a Plumb; in others a white soft Root supplies the office.

[Sidenote: The _Canopia_-Tree.]

[Illustration]

The little Tree _Canopia_, out of whose Bark drops a Gum, grows also
very pleasant, the Body being divided into several Branches; the Leaves
are discolour’d, being underneath of a dark Green, and of a brighter at
the top; the Flower consists of five Leaves, and closes at last into a
kind of Cherry, full of yellow Juice, and white Pulp; it blossoms
generally in _October_ and _December_, and bears ripe Berries the two
following Moneths: a Fire being made about the Tree causeth the Bark to
crack, whereby it yields abundance of Gum, chiefly us’d in Medicine for
its opening and loosening Quality.

[Sidenote: The _Paretuve_-Tree.]

Likewise the _Paretuve_-Tree, which grows along by the Sea-side and by
Pools, is sufficiently remarkable, for the Boughs thereof grow
downwards, twin’d and pleited together so thick, that in time of War
they serve for Bulwarks, and are the Recesses of wild Swine.

[Sidenote: The _Calabash_-Tree.]

Moreover, on this Island, as on all the other hereabouts, grow
_Calabash_-Trees, which have thick Boughs and oval Leaves joyn’d one to
another, and bear every Moneth fresh Flowers and Fruit, grey Flowers,
mark’d with green Streaks and black Spots, and Fruit with hard Shells,
full of juicy Meat and flat Seeds, which being taken out serve for
Boxes, Cups, or little Dishes.

[Sidenote: _Sea-Star._]

Along the Shore is also found a sort of Fish call’d the _Sea-Star_,
which is a yellowish Fish, whose hard Skin full of little Knobs shoot
forth five Darts or Beams; in stormy Weather they fasten themselves to
the Rocks.

[Sidenote: _Sea-Apple._]

No less wonderful is the Fish call’d the _Sea-Apple_, whose brown Skin
is full of Prickles, which when the Fish dies fall off, nothing
remaining but a white Shell, curiously embroider’d with little Holes.

On the Banks, and near the Rocks, grow also Sea-Trees, whose thickest
Boughs putting forth still lesser and lesser Branches, are pleited
together very wonderfully, and being all glaz’d as it were with
Salt-petre, seem greyish.


                               SECT. IX.
                               Barboude.

[Sidenote: Situation of _Barbouthos_.]

_Barbouthos_, which some call _Barboude_, others _Barbada_, being five
Leagues in length, lies at seventeen Degrees and thirty Minutes, and
North-East from _Monserrat_, in a shallow Sea.

[Sidenote: _English_ molested by the _Caribbeeans_.]

Here the _English_ Planting, have from their first Arrival been much
molested by the _Caribbeeans_ of _Dominico_, who for a great while us’d
twice a year to Invade them in the Night, killing and destroying whom
and whatsoe’re they met with, onely Women and Children, with some other
Booty, they carried to _Dominico_.


                                SECT. X.
                                Rotonda.

[Sidenote: Situation of _Rotonda_.]

The Isle _Rotonda_, which is much lesser, hath receiv’d that
Denomination from its round Form, for it rises in the middle into a
Hill, which at a distance appears like a Steeple; It lies at seventeen
Degrees and ten Minutes. The Sea about the same being very deep, makes a
good coming to the Island with Ships.


                               SECT. XI.
                                 Nevis.

[Sidenote: Situation of _Nevis_.]

In sight of _Rotonda_, at seventeen Degrees and nineteen Minutes, lies
_Nevis_, which hath six Leagues in circumference. Out of the middle of
the Island rises a Mountain all over wooddy; round about which the
_English_, who Setled there _Anno 1628._ have their Plantations, and
have increased from a small number to above three thousand, and make a
good Advantage of their Sugar, Ginger, Cotton, and Tobacco, which they
Plant there.

[Sidenote: Good Government of the _English_ there.]

They are Govern’d by a peculiar Governor and a Council, who punish
Thieves, and all manner of Deboshes very severely.

There are also three Churches, which on the Sabbath-Day are all throng’d
with People, who resort thither for the Worship and Service of God.

The Harbor call’d _Bath-Bay_, and the Store-house built about the same,
are secured by a great Fort full of great Guns.

Several Springs on this Island afford the Inhabitants good Water. Here
is also a Mineral Spring, a place to Bathe in, which hath been found to
cure the same Distempers which the Waters at _Bourbon_ have done.

[Sidenote: The _Pistick_-Nut.]

Moreover, this Island abounds with the _Pistacie_ or _Pistick_-Nuts,
which grow on small Trees, with soft long Leaves, round at bottom, and
ending in three Points: These Trees being commonly full of thick Boughs,
serve commodiously for Hedges; the Wood and Leaves sweat a milky Juice,
dropping out of the same with the Rain; the yellow Flowers which grow on
the same are like glittering Stars, and the taste of the Nuts like a
Hazle; but if the Skin which covers the Kernel be not pull’d off before
they are eaten, they purge to Death.

[Sidenote: The _Musticho_.]

But the great Profit which _Nevis_ receives by Nature is attended with
some Inconveniences, which trouble this and all the other Islands:
amongst many may be reckon’d the _Musticho_’s, a sort of little Bugs,
whose poysonous Sting causes such intolerable Itching, that those who
are stung by them cannot forbear to scratch themselves till the Blood
comes, by which their Sores festering, prove often very dangerous.

[Sidenote: The _Muringoins_.]

Also the _Muringoins_, who are so much the less dangerous, because they
make always a great noise before they sting.

Wasps likewise are here very troublesom, but their Stings are cur’d with
Rue, as the Stings of Scorpions are with the Juice press’d out of the
same Animal.

[Sidenote: Wood-Lice.]

The Wood-Lice, which are here in great abundance, have a soft and white
Body, onely the Head, which is mark’d with a black Speck; their Mouthes
are so very hard, that in two hours time they eat through thick Chests.
And no less damage do the _Banettos_.

[Sidenote: _Chigos_.]

But the _Chigos_ are a kind of small Fleas, that breed in Dust, Ashes,
and the like, and are of all the most pernicious; they first get in
under the Nails of the Toes, and from thence run over all the Body, but
especially the bottoms of the Feet, where they first occasion an
Itching, and then eat Holes through the Skin; they make Blisters as big
as Pease in the Flesh, wherein a swarm of young ones breeding, cause
Ulcers and rotten Flesh, which must be eaten away with _Aqua-fortis_ and
burnt Allom.


                               SECT. XII.
                              Eustathius.

[Sidenote: Situation of _Eustathius_.]

_Eustathius_, which is rather a Mountain, rising out of the Ocean like a
Sugar-Loaf, than an Island, lies at seventeen Degrees and forty Minutes:
It hath scarce five Leagues in circumference, yet receiv’d some while
since a Colony of above sixteen hundred People, sent thither from the
_States_ of the _United Netherlands_, under the Command of the Lords
_Lampsen_ and _Ree_. Besides the natural Strength of the Place, whereby
a few are able to keep off a great number, it is fortifi’d with a strong
Fort, which Commands the Harbor. The Inhabitants are very industrious,
and make great profit of the Tobacco which they Plant.

In the midst of this Island is a Mountain over-grown with Trees, which
seems to end in a Point, and hath about it a pleasant Plain.

The abundance of Fowls, Hogs and Goats, afford the Inhabitants store of
Provisions; for their Store-houses are never so empty, but that they can
supply their Neighbors Wants.

The want of fresh-water Brooks they supply with Rain-water, which they
preserve in Cisterns.

[Sidenote: Terrible Hurricanes.]

Though the Air of the Island be wholsom, and the Soil fruitful, yet it
is subject to many great Inconveniences; for besides the terrible
Thunder-claps and Earthquakes, that rend the Ground, the Inhabitants are
exceedingly troubled in _August_, and _September_ with the Winds, which
in twenty four hours blow from all Points of the Compass with such
mighty Gusts, as if they would turn all things into their first _Chaos_.
The _Caribbeeans_ call these Tempests _Hurricanes_, which formerly us’d
to happen but once in seven years, but of late every two years, and
sometimes twice in a year. What damage these Winds cause is scarce to be
express’d; the Sea raising its turbulent Waves up to the Skyes, casts
the Ships on the Shore, which though in Harbor, are certain to be
wrack’d, whilest the Land seems to labor under a general Ruine, whole
Woods being rooted up by the same, or at least bereav’d of Boughs and
Leaves; the Corn is beaten down, the Plants blasted, Houses turn’d
topsie-turvy, Mountains rent asunder, and sometimes pieces of Rocks
blown into the Sea. Before the Hurricanes there are several
fore-runners, which give notice of their sudden approach, _viz._ the Sea
on a sudden is so calm, that the least motion is not perceiv’d; the
Birds flye from the Mountains into the Valleys, where they lay
themselves flat on the Ground; and the Rain which falls is bitter and
salt.

_Charles de Rochfort_ observ’d, that in his time some Ships laden with
Tobacco being lost in a Hurricane before _St. Christophers_, soon after
the Tempest ceased, thousands of Fishes were seen swimming with their
Bellies upwards, intoxicated no doubt with the Tobacco.


                              SECT. XIII.
                                Antego.

[Sidenote: Situation of _Antego_.]

Between _Nevis_ and _Montserrat_, at sixteen Degrees and eleven Minutes,
lies _Antego_, being seven Leagues long, and about six broad; It is
dangerous to come at with great Ships, because of the many Rocks which
lie before it, and remain’d the longer uninhabited, because of the want
of fresh Water; yet at last the _English_ taking possession of it,
digg’d Pits, and made Troughs to catch and preserve Rain-water in, so
that it is now inhabited by at least eight hundred People, who live on
Plants, Venison, and Fish.

[Sidenote: The _Sword_-Fish.]

Upon the Sea-shore appears often-times the Sword-fish, which hath no
Scales, but a grey Skin, and white Belly, rough like a Fyle, a flat
Head, two Fins on each side, two on the Back, and one in stead of a
Tail, with which it makes a swift motion: the Sword of it is a long
Bone, arm’d on each side with twenty seven white and strong Teeth. This
Fish striving to be Chief of the Sea, Encounters with all other Fishes
whatsoever, even with the Whale himself, whose Belly he often rends
open; near his Eyes are two Nostrils, out of which he blows the Water he
drinks into the Air.


                               SECT. XIV.
                              Montserrat.

[Sidenote: Description of _Montserrat_.]

_Montserrat_, lying just at the seventeenth Degree, is so call’d from a
_Spanish_ Hill beyond _Barcellona_, whose shape this Island represents
off at Sea; It is about three Leagues in length, and almost as much in
breadth, and is very Mountainous, except a little towards the East, and
as much Westward.

The _English_ have a Church here, lin’d in the in-side with Cedar, which
this Island produces in great abundance.

[Sidenote: The _Acajou_-Tree.]

Also the _Acajou_-Tree, which grows an exceeding heighth, with mighty
Boughs, under which many judge it very wholsom to sleep: But there are
two sorts of the _Acajou_-Tree, the one differing from the other in
tallness of Body and Colour; of which the most esteem’d is the red and
sweet-smelling, which is not subject to any decay; for that which is
white, and yields Gum when cut, is of a less value.

[Sidenote: The _Acomas_-Tree.]

The _Acomas_ is also no way inferior in bigness to the _Acajou_, which
bears long swarthy Leaves, and yellow Fruit not unlike a Plumb; but
because of their extraordinary bitterness they are not eatable, onely
the wild Pigeons at a certain time of the year feed on them, after which
their Flesh becomes bitter also; from the Bark when cut, runs a milky
Juice.

[Sidenote: The _Cypress_-Tree.]

The Cypress-Trees when plan’d, yield a pleasant Marble colour to the
Eye, and a delightful fragrance to the Scent.

[Sidenote: The _Iron_-Tree.]

The Iron-Tree, with sharp-pointed Leaves, crack’d near the Stalk,
blossoms in _March_ and _September_; after the Violet Blossoms follow a
black kind of Fruit like a Cherry, being an excellent Food for Birds;
the Wood whilst flourishing is red, but cut down changes its colour, yet
is so hard that it never decays.

[Sidenote: The _Musk_-Herb.]

Moreover the Musk-Herb yields a sweet smell, and grows like Brambles
without Thorns; between long dusky Leaves hang yellow Flowers, which
afterwards become Cods full of Seeds, that smell exactly like Musk.


                               SECT. XV.
                               Guadalupe.

[Sidenote: Situation of _Guadalupe_.]

_Guadalupe_, or _Gardelupe_, formerly call’d _Carricueira_, lying at
about sixteen Degrees, and containing sixty Leagues in circumference
(for it is the biggest and noblest of the _Caribbee_ Islands,) is
divided in two by a narrow Channel; wherefore one part is call’d
_Grand-Terre_, and the other properly _Guadalupe_; whose Eastern Point,
nam’d _Cabes-Terre_, and its Western, call’d _Basse-Terre_, are both
inhabited by the _French_.

[Sidenote: Mountains.]

Several high Mountains, especially towards the Center, start up from
very low Grounds, with their barren Crowns towards the Skye, some
whereof are overgrown with Trees.

At the Feet of some of the Mountains are large Plains, water’d by sweet
Streams which formerly invited the _Spanish_ Fleets thither to water.

There is also a sulphurous Mountain, which smoaking continually gives
the taste of Sulphur to the Streams which flow about the same.

This Island boasts likewise several boyling Springs which cure the
Dropsie, and all other Distempers proceeding from Colds.

[Sidenote: Strange Fish.]

Towards each of the two fore-mention’d Points, are large Gulphs that
produce abundance of Tortoises, and all manner of Fish, and amongst
others one sort not known by Name, which is generally about four Foot
long, having a sharp and big Head, with glittering Eyes, a Back streak’d
with blue and green, and a Belly half white and half red, eight yellow
Fins, and a broad Tail, with which it swims exceeding swift.

[Sidenote: The Shark.]

Near the Shore swim the Sharks, an ugly Sea Monster, which bites a Man
asunder in the Middle at once; their Head is hard and prickly, their
flat Mouthes opening discover three rows of Teeth.

[Sidenote: The _Pilot_-Fish.]

After this Fish swims generally the _Pilot_-Fish, or _Rambos_, which is
so curiously speckled, that Nature seems herein to excell what-ever can
be represented by the artificial Pencil and move either swifter or
slower, according as the Shark leads. The Brain of this Fish is judg’d
exceeding good against the Gravel and Stone.

[Sidenote: The discovery of _Guadalupe_.]

_Guadalupe_ was first discover’d in the Year of our Lord 1635. by the
_French_, under the Command of the Lords _Du Plessis_ and _De Olive_,
and after them one of the Captains of _St. Christophers_: Since which
the Champain Ground being Till’d and Manur’d, brings forth in great
plenty, Rice, _Maiz_, _Manicock_, and Potato’s.

Father _Raymond Breton_ got possession of the fruitfullest part of the
Island for the Reformed _Jacobines_, or _White-Fryers_, and since the
present Governor Monsieur _De Howell_ sent also for the _Jesuits_ and
_Carmelites_, to build Cloysters in a new City, which lies in
_Basse-Terre_, and which is also built full of Store-houses and
Dwelling-houses two Stories high.

The Castle, which lies near the City, hath four Bulwarks, with great
Guns.

The next neighboring Mountain is also crown’d with a Garrison’d Fort.

[Sidenote: The _Moubane_-Tree.]

The Countrey hereabouts bears _Moubane_-Trees, which produce yellow oval
Plumbs with great Stones, wherewith the Hogs are exceedingly fatned.

[Sidenote: The _Corbary_.]

The _Corbary_, which grows higher than the _Moubane_, hath a hard shelly
Fruit, in which lies a douny Pulp of a Saffron colour: The Gum which
drops out of the Tree is hardned by the Sun, and becomes very clear,
wherefore the _Caribbeeans_ make use of it for Arm-rings, and other
Ornaments.


                               SECT. XVI.
                                Deseado.

[Sidenote: Situation of _Deseado_.]

Ten Leagues to the North-West of _Guadalupe_, and at sixteen Degrees and
ten Minutes, appears _Deseado_, or _Desirado_, like a Galley, of which
the North-East end hath a low Point; to the Northward lie Sand-Hills
full of red Veins: It was so call’d by _Christopher Columbus_ in his
second Voyage, from obtaining of his Desire, it being the first of the
_Caribbees_ which he discover’d, as _St. Salvador_ the first Land in all
_America_.

[Sidenote: The _Guano_.]

The Soil is wholly barren, and destitute of Trees, and breeds the
amphibious Creatures call’d _Guano_’s, which in stead of Fins to swim
withal, have four Feet; the biggest of them are fifteen Inches long;
their Skin full of little Scales shines like Silver, and in the Night
they make a loud and shrill noise from the Holes in the Rocks.

[Sidenote: The _Frigates_.]

On this desolate Island are an innumerable company of Fowls, call’d
_Frigates_, which have a Body like a Duck, but larger Wings, and flye
swifter; so soon as they perceive a Fish in the Water, they falling upon
the same, catch them in their Claws, and especially devour abundance of
flying Fish.

[Sidenote: The _Fauves_.]

But the _Fauves_, which are much leaner, are no way so swift; they
resemble a Moor-Hen, have Feet like Ducks, Bills like a Snipe, and in
rainy Nights rest on the Ships in stead of Rocks, so that many times
they become an easie prey to the Mariners.


                              SECT. XVII.
                              Marigalante.

[Sidenote: Situation of _Marigalante_.]

Not far from hence, at fifteen Degrees and forty Minutes, appears
_Marigalante_, like a Wood in the Water.

On the South-East side, about half a League from the Shore, lie black
full of white Specks. Westerly the Shore is very plain, whither the
Governor Monsieur _De Howell_ sent some People from that Island, of
which twenty were kill’d by the _Caribbeeans_, who had Gardens and
Fish-ponds thereon: Not long after which _Howell_ built a Fort here, and
Garrison’d the same with _French_-men.

The Woods afford a delightful sight to the Eye, as also the
Cinamon-Trees, whose Leaves never wither, a sweet smell to the Nose.

[Sidenote: The Fish _Lamantin_.]

The Ocean hereabouts produces plenty of _Lamantins_, which are dry’d
like Haberdine. This Fish grows eighteen Foot long and seven thick; the
Head thereof is like a Cows, with little Eyes, and a thick brown Skin,
rough and speckled in some places, and hath two little Feet in stead of
Fins; it feeds on Weeds, which grow on the Rocks and Banks; the Females
bring two young ones at a time, which suck for some days; their Flesh
palatable and wholsom, is streak’d with Fat, which when melted never
putrifies; they are oftner taken in the Mouthes of Rivers than in the
Ocean.

[Sidenote: The _Sea-Devils_.]

About this Isle, as well as the rest of the _Caribbees_, are Fishes
call’d _Sea-Devils_, four Foot long, and proportionably thick, their
Skins rough, their Heads flat, their Backs arm’d with Prickles, little
black Eyes, wide Mouthes full of Teeth, and two Tusks that slick out of
the same, four Fins, a long slit Tail, with which they swim exceeding
swift, above their Eyes slick broad sharp Horns turn’d towards the Back;
the Flesh is deadly poyson.

[Sidenote: The _Becune_.]

The _Becune_, which is eight Foot long, falls upon a Fish like a mad
Dog, biting great pieces of the Flesh out of the Body, which occasions
present Death; its Flesh is likewise poyson.


                              SECT. XVIII.
                             Todos Sanctos.

[Sidenote: Situation of _Todos Sanctos_.]

[Sidenote: Curious sorts of Shells.]

Southward from _Guadalupe_, and at the same Latitude with _Marigalante_,
lie four desolate Isles, call’d _Todos Sanctos_, and on their Shores a
sort of Shell-fish call’d _Lambis_, from the resemblance of a Tongue;
the Shells whereof the _Indians_ Sound in stead of Horns when they give
an Alarm; as also another sort call’d _Porcelenes_, of which the most
esteem’d are without of a Carnation, and within of a Silver, or
Skye-colour mix’d with Golden Beams. The next are the Black, mix’d with
a pale Blue, and little Veins. But the most remarkable Shells are those,
whose Back Nature hath mark’d in such a manner with Musical Notes, that
one might almost express a Tune by them.

[Sidenote: Mother-of-Pearl Oysters.]

Moreover, it would amaze the Beholder, to see the Mother-of-Pearl Oyster
moving at the Foot of a Rock; for at the Rising of the Sun they appear
above the Water, and gape for the Dew, of which they have no sooner
receiv’d a Drop, but they close their Shells, and fall to the Ground
again.


                               SECT. XIX.
                                De Aves.

[Sidenote: Situation of _De Aves_.]

Westward from _Todos Sanctos_, at fifteen Degrees and forty five
Minutes, lies the Isle _De Aves_.

[Sidenote: _Aigrettos._]

Besides Ducks, Pluvers, Moor-hens, Geese, and the like Fowls (that
suffer themselves to be catch’d by the Hands of Men, which are very
strange to them) there are here also many rare sorts of Birds, as the
white Birds call’d _Aigrettos_, which are somewhat bigger than Crows,
with red Bills and Feet, and curious Plumes on their Heads; they often
flye a great way off at Sea.

[Sidenote: _Craw-fowl._]

The large Bird call’d _The Craw-fowl_, which feeds on Fish, hath a thick
Head, a long flat Bill, hollow Eyes, and a short Neck, under which hangs
the Maw, big enough to contain a Pail full of Water: On the Trees along
the Sea-side they watch for Fish which swim near the top of the Water,
and by their attentiveness on their Prey, are easily shot themselves.

[Sidenote: _Arras._]

Here is likewise the Bird _Arras_, of the bigness of a Pheasant, but
more resembling a Parraquito: their long Tail consists of divers
colour’d Feathers, some have shining skye-colour’d Heads, Backs, and
Necks, their Bellies and Wings of a pale Yellow; they are so stout, or
rather so simple, that if they are not hit with the first Shot, they
will stay for a second: They also learn to talk, but not so distinctly
as the _Canides_, which are no way inferior in beauty to the _Arras_,
nay exceed them very much: Monsieur _du Montell_ above mention’d, seeing
one at _Corassao_, describes it after this manner:

[Sidenote: Description of the _Canides_.]

“It deserves to be numbred (saith he) amongst the most beautiful Birds
in the World: I took so particular notice of it, having had of them in
my Hands many times, that I have the Idea’s of it still fresh in my
Memory. Under the Belly, Wings, and Neck, it was of a waving
_Aurora_-colour, the Back, and one half of the Wings, of a very bright
Skye-colour, the Tail and greater Feathers of the Wings were mix’d with
a sparkling Carnation, diversifi’d with a Skye-colour, as upon the Back
a Grass-green and shining Black, which very much added to the Gold and
Azure of the other Plumage: But the most beautiful part was the Head,
cover’d with a Murrey Doun, checquer’d with Green, Yellow, and a pale
Blue, which reach’d down wavingly to the Back: The Eye-lids were white,
and the Apple of the Eye yellow and red as a Ruby Set in Gold: It had
upon the Head a certain Tuft or Cap of Feathers of a Vermilion Red,
sparkling like a lighted Coal, which was encompass’d by several other
lesser Feathers of a Pearl-colour.

“If it were recommendable for all these extraordinary Ornaments, it was
much more for its Familiarity and Innocency; for though it had a crooked
Beak, and that the Claws with which it held its Meat and brought it to
its Beak, were so sharp as to take away whatsoever it fastned upon, yet
was it so tame as to play with little Children and never hurt them; and
when one took him into his Hand, he so contracted his Claws, that the
sharpness of them could not be felt: He had this Quality of a Dog, That
he would Lick with his short and thick Tongue those who made much of him
and gave him something he lik’d, put his Head to their Cheeks to Kiss
and Caress them, and expressing his Acknowledgments by a thousand pretty
Insinuations, he would suffer himself to be put into what posture one
would, and took a certain pleasure in diverting those he thought his
Friends: But as he was mild and tractable to those who were kind to him,
so was he mischievous and irreconcileable to such as had injur’d him,
and he could distinguish them from others, and make them feel the
sharpness of his Beak and Claws.

“He pratled in the _Dutch_, _Spanish_, and _Indian_ Languages, and in
the last he sung Airs as a natural _Indian_: He also imitated the Cries
of all sorts of Poultrey and other Creatures about the House; he call’d
all his Friends by their Names and Sirnames, flew to them as soon as he
saw them, especially when he was hungry; if they had been absent, and
that he had not seen them a long time, he express’d his joy at their
return by certain merry Notes; when he had sported himself till they
were weary of him, he went away, and perch’d himself on the top of the
House, and there he talk’d, sung, and play’d a thousand tricks, laying
his Feathers in order, and dressing and cleaning himself with his Beak.
He was easily kept; for not onely the Bread commonly us’d in that
Island, but all the Fruits and Roots growing there, were his ordinary
Food; and when he had more given him than he needed, he carefully laid
up the remainder under the Leaves wherewith the House was cover’d, and
took it when he had need. In a word, I never saw a more loving or more
amiable Bird; ’twas a Present for any Prince, if he could have been
brought over the Sea. This Bird had been brought from the _Caribbee_
Islands to Monsieur _Rodenborck_, then Governor of the Fort and _Dutch_
Colony, which is in the Island of _Corassao_.”


                               SECT. XX.
                               Dominico.

[Sidenote: Situation of _Dominico_.]

At fifteen Degrees and thirteen Minutes, lies the Island _Dominico_, so
call’d because it was discover’d on a _Sunday_, about thirty Leagues
long, and not much less in breadth, and diversifi’d with high Mountains,
and exceeding deep Valleys; of which the _Caribbeeans_ that dwell there
relate, That formerly in one of the deepest of them, a huge and
monstrous Serpent had an Army of Serpents to defend an invaluable
Carbuncle which he had in his Head; which being cover’d with a thin
Skin, was onely discernable when he drank or play’d, for then the lustre
thereof lightned the whole Valley.

When first the _French_ approach’d this Coast with their Ships, the
Islanders going Aboard in their _Canoos_, barter’d Provisions for Coral,
Crystal, and other Trifles.

[Sidenote: The _Manchenile_ Tree.]

On this Isle also grows the famous _Manchenile_-Tree, which bears long
Leaves, and sweet smelling Fruit, streak’d red, and tasting like a
Hazle-Nut, but bringing a deadly Sleep upon those that eat of it; it
seldom rots though it fall into the Sea, or any fresh Rivers, but is
crusted over with a Shell resembling Salt-petre, and poysons the Water
in such a manner, that all the Fish dying, are seen floating upon it; in
the Trunk and Boughs thereof is a milky Juice, which dropping upon the
Body, causes it to break out in Scabs, and if it chances to touch the
Eyes, it takes away the Sight for nine days: and not less hurtful is the
Moisture which drops from the Tree.

The _Caribbeeans_ dip their Arrows in this poysonous Juice, against
which Nature hath provided an excellent Medicine, being as followeth:

[Sidenote: A Medicine against the poison of the _Manchenile_.]

There are amongst the other Reptiles of _America_ a sort of Snails,
which creep into the Legs of dead Crabs, to keep themselves from the
Weather; when taken they make a noise, and being laid before the Fire
they come forth; the Water squeez’d out of them, or the Oyl drawn from
them by the Sun, cures the Parts poyson’d by the _Manchenile_-Tree.


                               SECT. XXI.
                               Martinico.

[Sidenote: Situation of _Martinico_.]

Opposite to _Dominico_ lies _Martinico_, by the _Indians_ nam’d
_Matunina_, which lying at fourteen Degrees and thirty Scruples, is
forty five Leagues in circumference; It appears at a distance like three
Mountains, the highest whereof resembles a Hat, and is seen in all parts
of the Island, which, on the North where three Rocks deny access for
Landing, seems to be divided into three Isles.

The _Caribbeeans_ have been forc’d, after many bloody Battels, to
surrender up this Island to the _French_: But before they were well
setled, the _Caribbeeans_ marching over exceeding high Mountains, deep
Concavities, and thick Woods, fell upon them with all the Rage
imaginable: the Reasons of which some attribute to _Du Parquet_, who in
prejudice of the _Martinican Caribbeeans_, sent _French_-men over to
_Granada_ and _Alouzia_: others suppose, that they took up Arms to
revenge the Death of their Countrey-men on _St. Vincent_, who were
destroy’d by the _French_ with poyson’d Brandy. But the _French_
furnish’d with new Supplies, took sufficient Revenge; for they drove the
_Caribbeeans_ out of their Houses, and chac’d them into Woods and
Deserts.

The Hills that are over-grown with Trees, are Receptacles for wild
Beasts, especially Hogs and Serpents. The other Hills are Till’d and
Sow’n, though not without great trouble.

The Tobacco which grows on the steep Ascents much exceeds that which
grows in the Valleys, or in the Tracts of Land shaded with Trees.

[Sidenote: The Island divided into five Wards.]

Since the _French_, _Anno 1635._ (being sent from _St. Christophers_ by
the Lord _Desnambuc_) Setled themselves on this Island, under the
Command of his Deputy _Du Pont_, they divided it into five Wards,
separated from that part of the Isle which was inhabited by the antient
Natives: Each Ward hath a Church, or at least a Chappel, Armory,
Store-houses, and Dwelling-houses, like an intire Village.

The first Ward is call’d _Pyloot_, from a _Caribbeean_ Captain, who was
very familiar with _Du Parquet_, and inform’d him of his Peoples
Designs.

The second, nam’d _Capot_, is wash’d by a River of the same
Denomination, and hath many fruitful Plains.

The third retains the _Caribbeean_ Name, being _Carbet_, signifying a
Publick Structure, to which they us’d to resort to Feast, or hold
Councils of War; not far from which the Governor dwelt in a Stone House:
Near the Harbor stood also an Armory in a Valley, water’d by a fresh
River which falls out of the Mountains, shaded with Trees and Gardens
full of Rarities: But since the Governor gave this and many other fair
Buildings to the _Jesuits_, he remov’d to the fourth Ward, call’d _St.
Peter_, where he built a Castle, and furnish’d the same with Brass and
Iron Guns to defend the Harbor.

A Stones-throw from the Governor’s House lies the _Jesuits_ Cloyster, on
the Banks of a pleasant Stream, built very artificially of Marble and
Free-stone, and having a pleasant Prospect over the River, and adjacent
Gardens, beautifi’d with the choicest of Flowers, Fruits, and Trees; and
also a Vineyard, out of which they press a considerable quantity of
Wine.

The last Ward, call’d _Preacheur_, extends East and West, some parts
whereof swell into high Mountains, at the Feet whereof stand fair
Structures; others sink into low Valleys or _Savannas_.

[Illustration: BARBADOS]

[Sidenote: The _Mahot_-Tree.]

Between the _French_ Settlements and the _Caribbeeans_, runs an Arm of
the Sea, along whose Shores grows abundance of the _Mahot_-Tree, which
is full of Boughs from the top down to the Ground. The Bark of this Tree
serves in stead of Ropes, and is also us’d to tie up Tobacco; the Wood
it self is durable, and good for Building, wherefore most of the Houses
built on Hills are of this Timber.

The best Harbor for Ships is between the Wards _Carbet_ and _St. Peter_,
defended from the Winds by high Hills.

[Sidenote: The _Diamond_.]

Not far from the Inlet of the Salt-pits, appears about half a League off
at Sea, a Rock call’d _The Diamond_, being a Receptacle for an
innumerable multitude of Birds, and especially wild Pigeons.

Besides the Streams that in the rainy Seasons run through the Dales and
_Savana_’s, there are ten Rivers, which falling from the Mountains,
glide through the Valleys into the Sea. Sometimes they swell in such a
manner, that over-flowing their Banks, they wash down the Trees and
Houses; which Inconvenience hath taught the _French_ to build their
Houses on Hills or rising Grounds.

The good Situation of this Island hath invited many Families thither.


                              SECT. XXII.
                               St. Lucia.

[Sidenote: Situation of _St. Lucia_.]

_St. Lucia_ (by the _French_, _Alouzie_) is so call’d because it was
discover’d on the thirteenth of _December_, Dedicated in the Kalendar to
the Virgin Martyr _Lucia_, who was burnt at _Syracuse_: It lies
Southerly from _Dominico_ at thirteen Degrees and forty Minutes, and is
ken’d at a great distance by two fiery Mountains; the most Easterly of
which is higher than the other.

At the Feet of these two Mountains lie pleasant Valleys, shadow’d by
close Woods, and moistned by clear Springs; near which heretofore a
small number of _Caribbeeans_ dwelling, maintain’d themselves with
Fishing; they went stark naked, and painted their Bodies with red Oker,
and drew a Vermilion Stroke from their Ears to their Noses.

An _English_ Ship sent to _Guinee_ to supply the Plantations there,
Landed sixty six mutinous Persons here, who were all kill’d by the
Inhabitants; but when _Henry Jacobson Lucifer_ putting into the Bay of
_Lucia_ to Water there, _Anno 1627._ Landed to discover the Island, he
found neither Man nor House, nor any thing but a barren Soil; yet
notwithstanding _Du Parquet_ sent his Deputy _Rosselan_ with a Colony to
Plant in this Island.


                              SECT. XXIII.
                               Barbados.

[Sidenote: Situation of _Barbados_.]

The Island _Barbados_, which was Planted by the _English_, _Anno 1627._
lies between thirteen and fourteen Degrees, and hath twenty five Leagues
in circumference, and somewhat more in length than breadth, and is
supply’d with a fresh-Water River, and several Pools. The Ground being
fruitful in the producing of Tobacco, Cotton, Ginger, and especially
Sugar, invited many People to Settle there, insomuch that in a short
time it could shew twenty thousand Inhabitants besides _Negro_ Slaves.

The Trees which grow on this Island, are not onely delightful, but
profitable; amongst which the _Roucou_ is one, with sharp Leaves, white
Carnation Flowers like Stars, which hang by Clusters at the end of the
Boughs, and after a while turn to a Cod full of vermilion Kernels: The
Juice dry’d in the Sun and kneaded into Balls, is of a great value. Of
the Bark of this Tree they make strong Ropes; and the Root is very
wholsom, and of a pleasant taste.

[Sidenote: The Fly _Cayouyou_.]

Moreover, amongst the Insects that breed here, there are a sort of Flyes
worthy of a short Description; the _Caribbeeans_ call them _Cayouyou_,
being about the bigness of a Beetle; they have two strong Wings, and
under them thinner, which they never spread abroad but when they flye,
and then they carry such a lustre in them, that they give as much Light
in the Night as a lighted Candle, (their Eyes also at the same time
glittering like Fire) making no noise when they flye; they feed on the
Juice of Flowers, and are so smooth, that they are very apt to slip
through ones Fingers, and when they find themselves to be taken, they
hide their glittering Wings under the other.

The _Indians_ tie these Flies to their Hands and Feet, so to have the
benefit of their Light in the Night; and anoint their Bodies all over
(at certain Solemnities wherein Candles are forbidden) with the Juice
squeez’d out of them, which causes them to shine like a Flame of Fire:
They catch them with a piece of Wood which they move in the Air,
whereupon the Flyes going to sit, are taken with a Hat; but their Light
vanishes if they are kill’d.

But as to what may farther be added concerning this Island, being one of
the chief of our Plantations, we cannot better satisfie the curiosity of
those who desire a true Information of all things that concern that
Place, than by inserting _verbatim_ a Letter from an intelligent Person
who hath been long resident there, _viz._ Colonel _Robert Rich_, of no
older Date than _May 31. 1670._ by which the present State and Condition
of the Island, the Buildings and other Improvements made there by the
Planters since they first possess’d it, in what Commodities of the
Growth of the Countrey their chief Trade consists, their Strength,
_Militia_, Government, and flourishing Commerce, and what-ever else is
material to be imparted, may be clearly understood.

[Sidenote: Colonel _Rich_ his Description of the _Barbados_.]


  SIR,

  _I have lately seen your_ Proposal _concerning an_ English Atlas,
  _and having read Dr._ Heylin_’s Book of the Chorography and History
  of the whole World, his third Edition Corrected and Enlarged,
  Printed_ Anno 1666. _I find him very short and erroneous in his
  Description of the_ Caribbee _Islands, especially of this Island of_
  Barbados, _wherein I have been an Inhabitant more than eleven years.
  He saith_,

      1. The Island is seventeen or eighteen Miles in compass.

      2. On the South ’tis furnish’d with a large and commodious
        Harbor.

      3. The chief Commodities are Tobacco, and a kind of course
        Sugar, call’d _Barbados Sugar_, which must be quickly spent,
        or ’twill melt to nothing.

      4. That this Island is worth all the Plantations made by the
        _English_, and yet that we hold it at the Courtesie of the
        _Spaniard_, without whose Leave and Liking, not of Force to
        hold it.

  _This Description of Dr._ Heylin_’s, in it self very false, is also
  much to the Dishonor of the_ English _Nation, which makes me presume
  to trouble you with my own Observations, wherein having onely aim’d
  at the Truth, you shall not have cause to doubt of being misguided_.

  _This Island of_ Barbados _is seated in thirteen Degrees and twenty
  Minutes, length twenty two Miles, and in breadth fourteen and an
  half; It is naturally fortifi’d with Rocks and Shoals on the North
  and East side of it, where no Ship may safely Anchor, onely two or
  three places small Boats may go out and in to Fish. On the
  South-East and Westerly part, it is all along a Road when Ships may
  Ride at Anchor, but more especially in four chief Places, Roads and
  Bays thereof._

  _The principal Road or Bay is call’d_ Carlisle Bay, _and lieth on
  the South-West part of the Island near its Center, and is a good
  Road, where five hundred Ships of any Burthen may Ride safely from
  all but South and Westerly Winds, which seldom in these Parts
  happen, they generally blowing Easterly, whence it is that we call
  the East parts_ Windward, _and the West parts_ Leeward. _Here lies
  also the chief Town for Trade, call’d formerly the_ Bridge-Town,
  _but now_ St. Michaels, _and having two Forts, answering each other,
  and a Platform between, which Commands the Road, and Defends the
  Town; the first and chiefest Fort is call’d_ Charles Fort, _standing
  on_ Nedhams Point, _lying out in the Sea to Windward of the Bay and
  Town, so that an Enemy keeping out of Command of this Fort, cannot
  (probably) come to do the Ships or the Town injury, for that they
  must come full in or against the Wind. This Fort is built strong
  with Stone and Lime; the Platform joyns to the Windward part of the
  Town; also the other Fort joyns to the Leeward part of the Town, all
  which are well fortifi’d and stor’d with great Guns. The Town
  consists of several Streets and Lanes, being about thirty Chain in
  length, and fifteen in breadth, and hath many fair and large
  Buildings, whereof the most are of Stone and Lime._

  _The second Road and Town is lately call’d_ Charles-Town, _situate
  on_ Oysters-Bay, _and lies about two Leagues to Windward of_ St.
  Michaels, _having also two Forts and one Platform; the two Forts
  stand the one to Windward, and the other to Leeward of the Town and
  Road, and the Platform in the middle, all well furnish’d with great
  Guns. And although this Town be not a Place of much Resort for
  Shipping, yet here are many considerable Store-houses for Trade,
  wherein Monethly are kept the Court of_ Common-Pleas _for that
  Precinct, and Weekly Markets_.

  _The third Road and Town is lately call’d_ St. James’s, _formerly
  the_ Hall, _and is about two Leagues to the Leeward of_ St.
  Michaels, _hath one very large Platform, and is otherwise well
  fortifi’d with Breast-works; and although few Ships come to Ride
  here, yet in this Town is maintain’d a great Trade with the
  Inhabitants adjacent; here also is kept Monethly the Court of_
  Common-Pleas _for this Precinct_.

  _The fourth Road and Town is lately call’d_ Little Bristol, _but
  formerly_ Sprights-Bay, _which lieth about four Leagues to Leeward
  of_ St. Michaels, _and hath two Forts well built, and strongly
  fortifi’d. To this Place come many Ships, especially from the City
  of_ Bristol, _the which here Ride, unload and re-load, it being the
  next greatest Place of Repute to_ St. Michaels _in the whole
  Island_.

  _This Island is divided into eleven Parishes, and hath in it
  fourteen Churches and Chappels, and being subdivided into divers
  Plantations, small and great, hath Sugar-works accordingly, with
  fair and large Buildings made of Stone and Brick, the which
  generally are pleasant Habitations, and delightfully situated, most
  having pleasant Prospects to the Sea and Land._

  _The Inhabitants of this Island are_ English, Scotch, _and_ Irish,
  _and some, but very few of the_ Dutch _and_ French _Nation, who
  formerly liv’d here a time of Servitude, and now dwell as Free-men,
  some by their Trades, and others on Plantations; also some few_ Jews
  _live here and Trade as Merchants, they having obtain’d Licence from
  His Majesty so to do; besides_ Mulatto’s _and_ Negro’s _which are
  here kept, and accounted for Slaves, the number of which some years
  since, upon search, were found to be sixty thousand Persons_, viz.
  _forty thousand_ Whites, _and twenty thousand_ Blacks.

  _The standing_ Militia _of this Island that are in readiness to meet
  together on all occasions, and which at other times are often and
  well Disciplin’d, consist of two Regiments of Horse, and five
  Regiments of Foot, wherein several Companies have near two hundred
  in a Company, and in some Troops more than a hundred Horse in a
  Troop; by all which you may easily apprehend how little of truth
  there is in that Saying_, That we hold this Island at the Courtesie
  of the Spaniards, _when those few_ English _in_ Jamaica _give the_
  Spaniards _such work to defend themselves_.

  _The Growth and Manufacture of this Island and parts adjacent, is
  Sugars of all sorts_, viz. Muscovado, _Clay’d, and Refin’d_; (_I
  suppose I have seen here as good Sugar made as any is in the World_)
  _Gingers_, _Indico_, _and Cotton-wool_; _also Tobacco_, _Logwood_,
  Fustick, _green and yellow, and_ Lignum-vitæ: _Of these four last
  heretofore much, but now no quantities to be had in this Island,
  onely to the Leeward great store. The first four mention’d
  Commodities receive prejudice to their Product by abundance of Rains
  or Droughts not happening their proper Seasons: also violent Winds
  lodge the Sugar-Canes, whereby the quantity and goodness is lessned.
  The chief time for Expectation is from_ January _to_ September,
  _when comes in the wet Season, that makes the Roads not Cartable,
  and usually puts an end to Making and Transportation of them. We
  have two Crops of Corn in a year, Planted usually when the Rains
  first come in, in_ May _and_ November, _which is gather’d in about_
  October, _and in_ March _and_ April _following. Wines of all sorts
  are here Imported, but of_ Portuguese _and_ French _the greatest
  quantities_, viz. _of_ Madera, _upwards of fifteen hundred Tun
  yearly; of_ Spanish, _upward of two hundred Tun; of_ French-_Wines,
  upward of seven hundred Tun; besides Brandy and_ English _Spirits;
  but of these latter now no great quantities Imported or spent, by
  reason of the general use of the Spirit of Sugar-Cane, call’d_ Rum,
  _which the meaner sort, as Servants and Slaves, do not onely drink
  in great abundance, but much also is hence Transported into_
  Virginia, Bermudas, _and_ New-England. _Here is also Imported great
  store of Provisions of all sorts_, viz. _Beef_, _Pork_, _Fish_, &c.
  _from_ Ireland, New-England, Virginia, Bermudas, New-found Land,
  _&c._ _also Pease_, _Flour_, _Butter_, _Cheese_, _and Bisquet_;
  _likewise Timber_, _Boards_, _Pipe and Hogshead_, _Staves_, &c.
  _also_ Negro-_Slaves from_ Guinee, _and live Cattel, as Bulls_,
  _Cows_, Asinego’s, _and Horses, from the_ Cape de Verd _Island_,
  New-England; _and from_ England, _Servants, and all other
  Commodities for Plantations, and for Apparel_; _of all which great
  quantities are hither brought and sold_.

  _The Shipping that comes to Trade to this Island belongs generally
  to_ England; _some few Vessels are here built, and pass to and fro
  to the Leeward Islands; and some belong to_ New-England, Bermudas,
  _&c._ _The number of Vessels which come hither to Trade in one year
  is found upon search to be about two hundred of all sorts, (some
  years more, some less) as Ketches, Sloops, Barques, &c. containing
  in Burthen fifteen thousand and five hundred and five Tun, according
  as they were here Entred, which is at the least a third part less
  than their true Burthen, by reason every Ship pays one pound of
  Powder_ per _Tun, the means ordain’d by this Country for storing the
  Magazine; the greatest part of which Ships re-load with Sugars for_
  England, _and many go for_ New-England, Bermudas, Virginia, Tangier,
  _&c._ _not always full loaden with this Countreys Growth. The usual
  Rate for Tunnage from hence to_ London, _is from_ 4 l. _to_ 5 l. per
  _Tun_; _sometime when Ships are very plentiful, it is at_ 3 l. _and
  less, and at other times when scarce, from_ 6 l. _to_ 7 l. _in the
  late War with the_ Dutch, _it was at_ 10. 11. _and_ 12 l. per _Tun_.

  _The Government is Constituted by the Laws of_ England, _and Laws
  not repugnant to them, onely some particular Laws are here made,
  proper for this Place, by the Governor (or Deputy) and his Council,
  (which usually are from seven to twelve in number) and an Assembly
  that consists of twenty two Persons, chosen by the Free-holders, two
  out of every Parish_.


                              SECT. XXIV.
                              St. Vincent.

[Sidenote: Situation of _St. Vincent_.]

The Island of _St. Vincent_, South-West from _St. Lucia_, and having
sixteen Degrees of North-Latitude, was so call’d by the _Spaniards_, as
having discover’d it on that Saint’s Day, being the fifth of _April_: It
is accounted eight Leagues long and six broad, and rises round about
with high Grounds and several Mountains, which are seen at a great
distance.

This Island hath a very fruitful Soil, and for the bigness of it hath
been long since well peopled with _Caribbeeans_ before the arrival of
the _Spaniards_, possessing here several Villages, to whom they are
still sworn Enemies, but Truck’d with the _Hollanders_ for Provisions,
Horns, Axes, Knives, and other Trifles. At the West and South sides are
convenient Bays to lie at Anchor and take Water in.

[Sidenote: The Fruit _Momen_.]

The Inhabitants highly esteem the _Momen_, growing to the bigness of an
Apple-Tree; the Fruit which it bears resembles a green Cucumber, and is
of a pleasant Juice, the Skin always green and prickly; the Seed which
is in the same about the bigness of a _French_ Bean, is generally black,
and streak’d with Golden-colour’d Veins.

[Sidenote: The _Granadilla_.]

Here is also that Plant mention’d elsewhere, by the _Spaniard_ call’d
_Granadilla_, by the _Dutch Rhang-Apple_, and _La Fleur de la Passion_
by the _French_; and it is so call’d, as being fancied to represent the
thorny Crown of our _Saviour_, together with the Cross, Nails, Hammer
and Pillar; the Plant runs along the Ground, unless it meet with a Pole
by which it runs up.


                               SECT. XXV.
                                 Bekia.

[Sidenote: Situation of _Bekia_.]

Not far from _St. Vincent_ lies the Island _Bekia_, which reckons
twelves Leagues in circumference, and lies at twelve Degrees and twelve
Scruples of Northern Latitude: It hath a secure Harbor against all
Winds; but because it is without fresh Water, it is onely frequented by
the _Caribbeeans_ that dwell on _St. Vincent_, who come hither to Fish,
and visit certain little Gardens which they have there for their
pleasure.

The Soil produces store of Water-melons, whose red juicy Pulp yields,
when squeez’d, a great quantity of sweet Liquor, which is very
refreshing, and good to create an Appetite; their white Flowers, notch’d
at the end of the leaves, afford a delightful smell.

_Anno 1633._ Captain _John Johnson Van Hoorn_ putting in to _Bekia_ to
catch Tortoises, found a fine Inlet on the West, and Eastward a Ridge of
Rocks, Cotton growing wild in the Fields, and upon the Shore a kind of
Snails call’d _Burgun_, under whose first Shell appear’d another of a
Silver colour with black Specks.


                              SECT. XXVI.
                                Granada.

[Sidenote: Situation of _Granada_.]

_Granada_, lying at twelve Degrees and sixteen Scruples, like a
Half-moon, from the North to the South, is full of Woods. Towards the
South-West runs a fresh River into the Sea. The Shore very low affords
good Anchorage at twelve Leagues distance. The Current grows exceeding
strong here, and the Water also ebbs and flows in a few hours. _Dirick
Simonszoon Witgeest_ Sailing from _Tabago_, was amaz’d to see with what
force the Current drove him to _Granada_.

[Sidenote: The _French_ possess it.]

Hither _Du Parquet_ at his own Charge sent three hundred Men from
_Martinico_, who scuffled with the Inhabitants six Moneths before they
could possess the same in Peace; and scarce had they obtain’d it at
last, but by telling them that the _French_ Assistance would be very
advantageous unto them against the _Arovages_.

The Duke _Seryllac_ in _Paris_ inform’d of the Fertility of this Island,
bought it of _Du Parquet_ for a considerable Sum of Money: And indeed
_Granada_ is none of the meanest of the _Caribbees_, the Soil producing
very good both Fruit and Timber-Trees, amongst which is the
_Latine_-Tree, of a tall Body, but ordinary thickness, and in stead of
Boughs, hang Leaves like Fans in long Stalks, which being ty’d together,
serve for Roofs of Houses.

There is also the Tree _Cocoa_, which yet grows not so high here as in
other parts of the _West-Indies_.


                              SECT. XXVII.
                                Tabago.

[Sidenote: Situation of _Tabago_.]

The next which comes in view is _Tabago_, (so call’d, as some think,
from the quantity of that Drug there Planted) eight Leagues long and
four broad, lying in the eleventh Degree and sixteen Minutes of Northern
Latitude, and hath many high Mountains full of Wood, out of which glide
eighteen Streams, which watering the Plains fall into the Sea.

Captain _Vitgeest_ coming to an Anchor here, found a convenient Inlet on
the East, and fresh Water to fill his Casks. Half a League from the
Shore rise five Rocks, through which he Sail’d with his Ships. Within
the Cliff opens a Bay, into which runs a River well stor’d with Fish.
More Westerly lies a larger Inlet, which receives two delightful
Streams. From the Western Promontory runs also a Cliff Northward into
the Sea.

This Island is easily known by high Coasts which rise on the East side,
and so grows lower by degrees. It is likewise made pleasant by many
Walks of Trees.

The Sea produces abundance of those sorts of Fish which are common
amongst us, besides Tortoises, that lay their Eggs in the Sand.

[Sidenote: Cra-fish.]

The Cra-fish thereabouts are not much unlike Lobsters, have white and
well tasted Flesh, but hard to digest; they catch them in the Night on
sandy Shelves with lighted Torches.

[Sidenote: Crabs.]

The Crabs get their Food very wonderfully here; for when they observe
the Mussles or Oysters to Gape for fresh Air, they put Stones between
their Shells, so that they not being able to shut them, they pull out
the Fish with their Claws.

The Woods feed an innumerable company of Beasts somewhat resembling
Hogs, (whose Navels are on their Backs) _Opassums_, _Javaris_’s, and
_Tatows_, as also the _Agoutys_’s and _Musk-Rats_.

[Sidenote: _Agoutys._]

The _Agoutys_’s are of a dark brown colour, and have little Tails, two
Teeth in their upper, and as many in their lower Jaw; they make a noise
as if they spoke, crying _Couye_; if hunted by Dogs, they run into
hollow Trees, out of which they are routed by Smoak.

[Sidenote: Musk-Rats.]

The great _Musk-Rats_ are as big as a Rabbet, and like them live in
Holes made in the Ground, but resemble an _European_ Rat, onely their
Skins are black, except one part of their Bellies which are white; they
smell so strong of Musk, that it overcomes those that carry them.

[Sidenote: Serpents.]

Amongst the Brambles breed also Serpents of a green colour, two yards
long, and an Inch thick, feeding on Locusts and Birds, which they take
in their Nests, but do no hurt to Mankind.

[Sidenote: The _Sassafras_ Tree.]

But _Tobago_ boasts chiefly of the _Sassafras_-Tree, which resembles the
Pine-Tree, hath a firm and streight Body, and on the top Boughs spread
like a Crown, the Bark of a dark colour and smooth, and smelling very
sweet; the Leaves thin, notch’d, and of a deep Green, have also a
delicate smell; the thinnest Roots appear above the Ground, and are
exceeding good to cure green Wounds, stoppings and shortness of Breath
occasion’d by Colds.

[Illustration]

The Tobacco, by the _Caribbeeans_ call’d _Y-ouli_, Planted among the
Fruit-Trees, grows very plentifully here; it shoots up from a stringy
Root, bitter of taste, with a thick Stalk, which shoots out Boughs with
great Leaves, woolly underneath, and bears a kind of Violet Flower,
which when dry’d, are succeeded by little Cods full of black Seed; and
to prevent the over-growing of it, they cut off the top of the main
Stalk.

[Sidenote: The Bird _Colibry_.]

The Bird _Colibry_, which is exceeding beautiful, makes his Nest under
the Tobacco-Leaves.

A company of Townsmen of _Walcheren_, having a Grant from the _States_
of the _United Provinces_, sent a Colony to _Tabago_; but they being
scarce two hundred in all, were for the most part destroy’d by the
_Caribbeeans_; the rest weak or sickly, fearing the same Entertainment,
sought to save themselves; so that the Island has not formerly been
frequented but by the _French_ from _Martinico_, and _Guadalupe_, who
for some time came over onely to catch Turtles and _Lamantins_ there.

The _Caribbeeans_ also either in their March against, or Return from the
_Arovages_, Landed here for necessary Provisions; But of late the Lord
_Lampsen_ hath Setled a Plantation in this desolate Island.


                             SECT. XXVIII.
                           St. Christophers.

[Sidenote: Situation of _St. Christophers_ Island.]

_St. Christophers_, a pretty distance from _Tobago_, receiv’d its
Denomination from _Christopher Columbus_, invited thereto by the shape
of a great Mountain, having as it were another lesser on one of its
Shoulders, being fancy’d to represent the Figure of the suppos’d Giant
_Christopher_, who is reported to have carry’d our _Saviour_ in the
appearance of a little Child on his Shoulders through a deep Sea.

This Island lying seventeen Degrees and twenty five Minutes Northward of
the _Equinoctial Line_, hath twenty five Leagues in circumference.

The Soil light and sandy, refuses not the production of divers sorts of
Fruits common amongst us.

In the middle of the Island rises a high Mountain, out of which run
fresh Streams, that sometimes swell so high with sudden Rains, that they
drown all the Countrey near them.

[Sidenote: The Division of the Island into several Wards.]

This Island being jointly the Plantation of both _English_ and _French_,
was divided into four Wards, two whereof have been long since in
possession of the _French_, and the other two in possession of the
_English_, strangely divided one from another; for the _English_ in one
Ward cannot go to the other without troubling the _French_; and so on
the contrary: the _English_ have more Rivers and People, the _French_
more plain Land, fitter for Cultivation, and Forts furnish’d with Guns
and Soldiers. At the Entrances of the Paths which lead into the several
Wards stand Watch-houses, where Sentinels, or Watch-men stand daily in
their turns.

In a Bay of the Sea they found a brave Salt-pit, from whence a sandy
Cliff runs so far into the Ocean, a that some have swum from the end
thereof over to the Island _Nevis_.

A Silver Mine hath been long since discover’d on this Island, in which
the _English_ and _French_ claim equal Interest, but neither Party make
any benefit of it for want of Miners.

The high Mountains, the Springs of boyling sulphurous Water, and brambly
Woods, hinder all passage through the middle of the Island: The Ground
runs more and more sloaping to the Sea-side, and is divided into several
High-ways, along which stand convenient Houses, cover’d with red or
glaz’d Slate, shaded with Trees, and environ’d with pleasant Gardens, to
which there is a delightful Prospect from the Fields, of the green
Tobacco-Leaves, the yellow Sugar-Canes, Ginger, and Potato’s.

[Sidenote: _Basse-Terre_ the chief Town belonging to the _French_.]

Besides the scatter’d Buildings, the _French_ have built a compleat Town
near the convenientest Harbor of their Quarter, call’d _Basse-Terre_,
where the Merchants dwell in fair Houses built of Brick and Free-stone;
whither all sorts of People bring their Commodities, and Truck their
_European_ Goods for such as _St. Christophers_ produceth. All manner of
Trades and Handicrafts live also in this Town, and a Court of Judicature
is kept every Week. The Church built of Free-stone, is cover’d with the
aforesaid red Slate, and was formerly Govern’d by the _Capuchins_; but
they being dismiss’d _Anno 1646._ the Government was given to the
_Jesuits_ and _Carmelites_; who also built themselves other stately
Edifices: but the Jesuit _Henrick du Vivier_ was the first who bore the
chiefest Command over all.

The Sick that have not sufficient Means to maintain them, have an
Hospital appointed, where all Necessaries are provided for them; and to
which is added a School for the bringing up of poor Children.

[Sidenote: Description of the Castle.]

But the chiefest Structure is the Castle, on the building whereof the
Lord _Poincy_ spar’d no Cost; it is built half a _French_ Mile from the
Sea at the Foot of a high Mountain, shadowed with great Trees. In the
Way thither stand the Houses of the prime Officers; and a long Walk of
Orange and Lemmon-Trees leads to a large Court before the Front of the
Castle it self, which is built square with Bricks and Free-stone three
Stories high; and the Entrance into it is ascended by a large pair of
Stairs; near the Gate which opens to the West, stand great Stone
Cisterns, into which they receive the Water through Pipes laid under
Ground; the Chambers and Halls are very lightsom and high, and the Walls
of them adorn’d with Cedar; a flat Terrace on the top yields a pleasant
Prospect all over the Countrey; the Windows in the Front look open not
onely upon the Orange Walk, but also upon several delightful Plantations
of Sugar-Canes and Ginger.

Westward appear several Mountains, whose high Heads are invested with
ever-flourishing Trees; and between the Palace and those Mountains a
very large and stately Garden, full of all manner of Flowers and other
delightful Plants, as well those commonly known amongst us, as those
peculiar to that part of the World; in the middle thereof stands a
Fountain, deriving its Source from the Foot of a neighboring Hill.

The Winds which blow from the Hills, and especially those cool Blasts
daily coming out of the East, so tempers the hot Climate, that it
becomes very tolerable.

When any News arrives here of the _French_ Conquests in _Europe_, they
sound the Trumpets on the top of the Castle, and the Standards and
Ensigns formerly taken by the Governor in the Field, are hung out of the
Windows.

On one side of the Castle stands a Chappel, and somewhat farther on a
rising Plain, a row of Houses, inhabited by certain Retainers to the
Governor, and is call’d _Angola_. The Offices and Lodgings for the
Governor’s Servants are built of Brick, about the Castle, which is
fortifi’d with five Sconces, whereon are planted several Guns.

The Governor keeps nine hundred Slaves, and a hundred _French_-men, to
work in his three Sugar-Mills, to till his Ground, and for his
Houshold-Service.

Several _French_ Gentlemen have also built many fair Houses here;
amongst which the chiefest are those on which _Poucy_, _Treval_,
_Benevent_, _Girand_, _Auber_, _de la Roziere_, _de St. Andant_, _de l’
Esperance_, and _de la Loche_ spent great sums of Money.

The _English_ also are not much inferior to them in their Counties.

[Sidenote: The _English_ Plantations in this Island.]

Their Churches are five in all; first on the Point of the _Palm-Tree_
stands a fair Church; a second near the great Road, below the _English_
Governor’s House; a third at the _Sandy Point_; which are all well
built, and large enough for a considerable Congregation; the other two
at the Inlet _Cayoune_ are short of the three first. The Ministers
thereof receiv’d formerly their Benefices from the Bishop of
_Canterbury_, in _Cromwell_’s time from the _Tryers_, as they were
call’d; but of late, since the King’s Restauration, from the Bishop of
_Canterbury_ again.

The best Houses belonging to the _English_ were built by Mr. _Warner_,
Mr. _Rich_, Mr. _Evrard_, and Col. _Geffreyson_ all successively
Governors of the Place.

[Sidenote: Their success at their first Landing.]

It was in the Year 1625. that the _English_ and _French_ jointly
(_Desnambuc_ Commanding the _French_, and _Thomas Warner_ the _English_)
Landed on this Island of _St. Christophers_, at a certain time when the
_Caribbeeans_, perswaded by their _Boyez_ to destroy all Strangers, were
ready up in Arms, but they met with such Entertainment, that they soon
lost their Courage, and yielded possession to the Assailants: Not long
after which _Desnambuc_ and _Warner_ went (the one to _Paris_, and the
other to _London_) to inform their Kings of the Condition of _St.
Christophers_, and to raise a Company which might promote the Planting
of it: Both attain’d their Desires, and had fresh Assistance given them;
for both Kings favor’d the Design, in regard of the good Conditions that
were propos’d to those that should go Undertakers thither: And to
prevent all Contentions between the _English_ and _French_, they made
Boundaries on each side; but Hunting, Harbors, Fishing, Mines, Trees for
Wainscoting, and the like, were to remain in common; and each was to
assist the other. The _English_ Plantation increased daily more than the
_French_; having constant Supplies from the Company in _London_; when as
on the contrary, the Merchants at _Paris_ grew weary, being desirous
first to have a Return for what they had already spent, though the
Countrey was not yet Manur’d: wherefore _Desnambuc_ going thither
himself, made the Company understand that they could not possibly expect
to receive a Return, unless the Countrey were Planted with Tobacco,
Indigo, Ginger, and Sugar, which requir’d both Time and People. But
whilst the Business seem’d to go on prosperously, a great Accident
hapned which threw down the Work to nothing: for the _Spanish_ King set
out a Fleet within the fore-mention’d Year, of one and thirty Gallions,
three Galeasses, and four Pinnaces, with seventy five hundred Men, under
the Command of _Frederick de Toledo_, _Emanuel de Mineses_, and _John
Fajardo_, from _Cadiz_, when before the Island _St. Jago_ there lay at
the same time twenty two _Portuguese_ Galleys, fourteen Carvils,
carrying four thousand Men, Commanded by _Antonio Nunnez Barreio_, and
_Francisco de Almeida_, who joyning with the _Spaniards_, took the City
_St. Salvador_, and went about wholly to chase out of the _Caribbee_
Isles all the _English_ and _French_: in which Attempt nine _English_
Ships lying before _Nevis_, were all taken by _Toledo_, who Sail’d
within Cannon-shot of _St. Christophers_, Commanded at that time by the
_French_ Captain _Rossey_, the Forts cast up by the _English_ and
_French_ not being stor’d with Provisions nor Ammunition, and
consequently no way able to endure a Siege, and the less, because the
Works were not quite finish’d; nevertheless _Desnambuc_ immediately drew
up his Soldiers to the Low-land, where he lay Intrench’d along the
Coast, to prevent the Enemies Landing; but _Rossey_ suffer’d the
_Spaniards_ to Land without the least Resistance: whereupon young _Du
Parquet_ Sallying out of the Sconces, fell valiantly upon the first
Company, but being forsaken by his Men, was run down by the Multitude
and kill’d: In the mean time all their Sloops full of Men Landed,
insomuch that _Rossey_ fearing to be surrounded, left his Trench and
went up into the High-lands, whereby the _Spaniards_ became Masters of
the Fort, but did not pursue their Victory, as suspecting that the
_French_ might lie in Ambuscade in the next Wood; and indeed they
suspected not in vain, for the _French_ having undermin’d their Forts,
had laid Gun-powder in some of the Cellars, which firing, blew up very
many of the _Spaniards_, whilst _Desnambuc_ Embarquing himself, sav’d
those which were not slain by the Enemy’s Sword. Mean while the
_English_ relying on the League between the King of _England_ and the
_Spaniard_, made no Resistance, (notwithstanding they were inform’d that
_Frederick Toledo_ had quite ruin’d the _French_ Plantation, and put
them all to the Sword) but sent Agents to _Toledo_, to put him in mind
of the League between _Spain_ and _England_, which he not taking notice
of, alledg’d, That Pope _Alexander_ the Sixth, when a Controversie arose
concerning the new Discoveries in the East and West, between the Crowns
of _Castile_ and _Portugal_, had determin’d that _Castile_ had sole
Right to the Western World, and therefore that _St. Christophers_, being
a part of the Western World, according to the _Pope_’s Gift, belong’d to
his Master _Philip_; and insisting upon that Allegation, he commanded
them to quit their Right to the Place; to which purpose he restor’d them
six of the nine Ships taken at _Nevis_, on Condition that they should
immediately set Sail for _England_, onely those whom the six Vessels
were not able to carry, were permitted to stay on the Island till the
next opportunity: After which _Toledo_ weighing Anchor, was scarce out
of sight, when the _English_ began to take new Courage, and gathering
together to repair their ruin’d Works as well as possibly they could
with what Forces they had left; for besides those who went for _England_
in the six Ships, being near two thousand, the _Spanish_ Admiral took
six hundred choice _English_, which he distributed amongst his Fleet;
whilest _Desambuc_ suffer’d a great deal of hardship, not onely through
ill Weather at Sea, but also for want of Provisions; Having during this
time been on the Islands _St. Martin_, _Montserrat_, and _Antego_,
thinking to have possess’d himself of some or other of them in stead of
_St. Christophers_, but not finding such a fruitful Soil, and convenient
Situation, as what he had been forc’d to forsake, he was not forward to
fix there, but rather judg’d it convenient to enquire concerning the
Condition of _St. Christophers_, and at last being inform’d by a Ketch,
that the Enemy was gone to _Havana_, and the _English_ were busie in
Tilling their Lands, he return’d to his old Station; where nevertheless
their Endeavors to repair what was ruin’d, had been in vain, by reason
of the scarcity of Provisions, and want of other Necessaries, had not in
their greatest extremity some _Netherland_ Vessels arriving there,
furnish’d them with Provisions, Clothes, and other Necessaries, on bare
promises of payment: But not long after growing rich with Tobacco,
Sugars, Ginger, and Indigo, they made Satisfaction to all their
Creditors, and at last attain’d to the Condition before mention’d.

In the late War between Us and the _Dutch_, the _French_ taking
advantage of our Engagement, endeavor’d to destroy our Plantations
there, and to make themselves Masters of the whole Island; but the
Matter being at last brought to some Agreement, Sir _Charles Wheeler_
hath been very lately sent over thither by His Majesty to re-settle
Affairs there, and order the Capitulations between the _French_ and
_English_.

                               CHAP. XIX.
             The Islands Sotavento, and the Isle Trinidado.


In the Division we found to be made of the Islands that lie between
_Florida_ and _New Spain_, and _Southern America_, the last are the
Isles of _Sotavento_, which are reckon’d to be these three, _Margareta_,
_Cubagua_, and _Tabago_, but the last is by most accounted, and hath
been mention’d amongst the _Caribbees_.

[Sidenote: Situation of _Margareta_.]

_Margareta_, so call’d from the abundance of Pearls (of which the
_Spanish_ Appellation comes near the Latine _Margaritæ_) found there by
the _Spaniards_ at their first Discovery, lies about the twelfth Degree
of Northern Latitude over against the Main Land of _Cumana_, from which
it is distant about seven Leagues: It is accounted sixteen Leagues long,
and half as much in breadth, and was discover’d by _Columbus_ in his
third Voyage in the Year of our Lord 1498. and was at first in great
reputation, in regard of the rich Pearl-fishing upon its Coasts, wherein
the _Spaniards_ (more favorable it seems to the Natives of this Place
than usual, because of their readiness to discover their Treasures)
employ’d _Negro_’s, brought from the Coast of _Guinee_, whom by severe
Punishments inflicted, they forc’d to such excessive Labor, that many of
them, though excellent Divers, were drown’d, others either devour’d, or
lam’d by the ravenous great Fish thereabouts, and by destroying the very
Seed through their insatiable greediness after Pearl, brought the Trade
of Pearl-fishing in a short time to a very small Account, in respect of
what it might have been, had it been well husbanded. Nor hath this
Island of late Years been much frequented, only in the Year 1601.
Captain _Parker_ with a Fleet of _English_ put on Shore here, and took
as many Prisoners as he had five hundred pounds of Pearl for the Ransom
of, and at his coming away took a Ship he met from off the Coast of
_Angola_, with three hundred and seventy _Negro_’s aboard her, who were
going to be sold for Slaves.

The Soil is not unfruitful, bringing forth several sorts of Fruit, and
store of _Maiz_, and probably if improv’d, would as well bear Wheat, and
other usual kinds of Grain; but there is great want of Water, which the
Inhabitants are troubled to fetch from the neighboring Continent.

[Sidenote: Towns and Places of chief note.]

The Places of chief note, are 1. _Monpater_, a Fort built by the
_Spaniards_ in a Nook of the Island, lying Eastward to secure the
Pearl-fishing Trade, and to defend the Town where the Governor resides,
as also the Treasurer of the King of _Spain_’s Customs of Pearl, which
have been formerly valu’d at 50000 _l._ yearly.

2. _El valle de Santa Lucia_, two Leagues from this Town, and as much
from the Sea, a _Spanish_ Colony.

3. _Macanao_, the onely noted Place belonging to the Natives.


                               SECT. II.
                                Cubagua.

[Sidenote: Situation of _Cubagua_.]

_Cubagua_ lies South-West of _Margarita_, about the eleventh Degree of
North-Latitude, a League or thereabouts distant from _Margarita_, and
six Leagues from the nearest Continent, and about three Leagues in
circumference. This is also a very great Place for Pearl-fishing, the
benefit whereof hath been so considerable, that the King of _Spain_’s
Fifths are said to have amounted some years to fifteen thousand
_Ducats_; but otherwise of a poor and barren Soil, not onely destitute
of Water, but of Fruit, Grain, Herbage, and all manner of Cattel and
eatable Beasts, except a few lean Coneys; nevertheless, in respect of
the Pearl-fishing Trade, the _Spaniards_ have Planted here a Colony,
which they call’d _New Cadiz_, having plenty of Provisions brought them
from the adjoining Coasts, and soon after their first Planting grew in a
short time so powerful, that they became Masters of one of the best
Ports of those Seas, call’d _Maracapana Venezuela_; but upon an Alarm of
the Salvages of _Cumana_, for a while deserted the Island, and betook
themselves to _Hispaniola_; from whence nevertheless being remanded back
with fresh Supplies, under the Command of _James de Castellon_, they
soon re-instated themselves in their former Plantation, and made it more
strong and flourishing than before; in which state they remain’d as long
as the Pearl-fishing Trade continu’d, but that decaying, the splendor
also of this Colony declin’d: so that at present the onely thing which
makes the Place remarkable, is a Fountain on the East part of the
Island, not far from the Sea, yielding a liquid bituminous Water, of
singular use in Medicine, and sometimes found floating on the Sea at two
or three Leagues distance.

[Sidenote: The Island _Coche_.]

About four Leagues distant from _Cubagua_ there is an Island call’d
_Coche_, about three Miles in compass; It was discover’d in the Year
1529. and was formerly little less considerable for Pearl-fishing than
the other two.


                               SECT. III.
                               Trinidado.

[Sidenote: Situation of _Trinidado_.]

The Island of _Trinidado_ was first discover’d by _Columbus_, _Anno
1447._ in his third Voyage, and by him so call’d, as some guess, from
its three Points or Promontories; but that seems not so probable, in
regard it is otherwise call’d _La Trinidad_, or _Insula Sanctæ
Trinitatis_, and therefore is likely to have been denominated upon a
religious Account: It lieth nine Degrees or thereabouts distant from the
_Line_, at the Mouth of the River _Orenoque_, and is separated from the
Coast of _Paria_, over against which it lies by a _Straight_ that is
three Miles over, and which for the dangerousness of passing it,
_Columbus_, the first Discoverer of it, call’d _Bocca del Draco_; the
length thereof from the most Southern Angle call’d _Punta del Andrada_,
to the North-East, call’d _Punta del Galera_, is reckon’d twenty five
Leagues, (those that reckon fifty, may be suppos’d to mistake Leagues
for Miles) and the breadth about eighteen.

[Sidenote: Chief Commodities of the Island.]

The Air of this Place is so impure, that it is accounted the
unwholsomest Island of all the _Indies_; nevertheless the Soil is not
unfertile, as bringing forth Sugar-Canes, Cotton, _Maize_, Tobacco of
the best kind, with other Commodities of the general growth of the
_West-Indies_, besides store of good Fruit and Cattel; and one part of
the Island call’d _Terra de Bea_, produceth great plenty of Pitch, but
not of the best kind; and there have been discover’d several Veins of
Gold and other Metals.

The Natives, some say, were antiently call’d _Cairi_, or _Carai_, and
were distinguish’d into several _Clans_ or Tribes, each under the
Government of a _Casique_, or petty Prince; but most of them dreading
the _Spaniards_ Cruelty, deserted the Island, and Setled themselves in
_Guiana_; and at present both this Place, _Guiana_, and _El Dorado_,
have of Custom one and the same Governor, whose Place of Residence here
is _St. Josephs_, the chief, if not onely Town of the Island; it stands
Southward upon the _Carone_. Here most of that Tobacco is made, which is
sold amongst us for _Spanish_. In the Year 1595. Sir _Walter Raleigh_
possess’d himself of it, being then but a petty Village of about forty
Houses, and took Prisoner the then Governor _Antonio Berreo_, who, in
all probability, to ingratiate himself with him, gave him some light
towards the discovery of _Guiana_.

[Sidenote: _Tabago._]

On the North-East of _Trinidado_, and not above eight Miles distant from
it, lies the Island of _Tabago_, which hath been already treated of, as
one of the _Caribbees_, though some will have it one of the _Sotavento_;
it is otherwise call’d _New Walcheren_, from a Town of that Name in
_Zealand_, from whence a Colony of _Netherlanders_ was sent to Plant it.

[Sidenote: _Virgin Gorda._]

Amongst others of the small obscure Islands hereabouts, is _Virgin
Gorda_, which is sometimes reckon’d amongst the _Caribbee_ Islands; but
since there is nothing considerable to be spoken of it, it is sufficient
that it hath been mention’d, though not punctually in its proper place.

[Illustration]




                               CHAP. XX.
                              California.


[Sidenote: _California_ how distinguish’d.]

Having before made mention of _California_, as it is by some taken for
that large portion of _Northern America_ which lies most Southward, and
also utmost West of all that is known of the _New World_, and having
treated of those several Provinces which are generally reckon’d to be
comprehended in it, (excepting _California_ strictly taken, as it is
generally granted to be an Island) _viz._ _Quivira_, _Cibola_, and _Nova
Albion_, lying on the Continent (though there want not those who make
_Nova Albion_ onely the North part of _California_) we shall close up
our Discourse of these Islands that lie Northward of the _Equinoctial
Line_ with the aforesaid _California_, specially so call’d, which was by
many thought and describ’d to be but a _Peninsula_, or half Island, by
reason that the Bay which divides it from _Quivira_ and _New Gallicia_,
towards the North runneth much narrower than it doth Southerly, which
made them think, that somewhere or other at the North it was joyn’d to
the Main Land of _America_; But later Discoveries, as hath been said,
have found it to be a perfect Island, and altogether separate from the
Continent: for about the Year 1620. some Adventurers beating upon those
Coasts Northward, accidentally, and before they were aware, fell upon a
_Straight_, the Waters whereof ran with such a Torrent and violent
Course, that they brought them into _Mar Vermiglio_, whether they would
or no, and before they knew it, and by that means discover’d that
_California_ was an Island, and that the Waters which were observ’d to
fall so violently into that Sea towards the North, were not the Waters
of any River emptying it self into the Bay from the Main Land, as was
formerly thought, but the Waters of the North-West Sea it self,
violently breaking into the Bay, and dividing it wholly from the
Continent: It lieth North and South, extending it self in a vast length,
full twenty Degrees of Latitude, _viz._ from twenty two to forty two;
but the breadth nothing answerable: The most Northern Point of it is
call’d _Cape Blanche_; that to the South, _Cape St. Lucas_, memorable
for that rich and gallant Prize which Captain _Cavendish_, in the Year
1587. being then in his Voyage about the World, took from the
_Spaniards_ near to this Place. As for the Island it self, it is at
present little, if at all inhabited by the _Spaniards_; whether it be
that they want Men to furnish new Plantations, or that they find no
matter of invitation and encouragement from the Countrey, or perhaps
that the access thither be not so easie: for ’tis reported to be
wonderfully well peopled by the Natives, and that there were found onely
upon the Coasts and along the Shore of _Mar Vermiglio_, twenty or twenty
three Nations, all of different Languages; though from the particular
Narrations that have been made of the Voyages of several eminent Persons
into these Parts, it appears that the _Spaniards_ have taken great pains
in the discovery thereof, and also from the several _Spanish_ Names of
Places, that they have had Plantations here formerly, however neglected
at present.

[Sidenote: The Customs and Manners of the Natives.]

The Countrey is abundantly well stor’d with Fish and Fowl, as appears
partly by the Natives, who take a huge pride in making themselves gay
with the Bones of the one, with which they load their Ears, and
sometimes their Noses also; and with the Feathers of the other, which
ordinary People wear onely sticking about their Wastes; but Great
Persons, and such as will be fine indeed, beset their Heads strangely
with them, and have commonly one Bunch of them bigger than ordinary
hanging down behind them like a Tail.

Having no knowledge of the true God, they worship what the Devil will
have them, that is, the Sun, attributing to it onely the increase of
their Plants, healthful Seasons, and most of the other good things they
enjoy, or are sensible of.

[Sidenote: Their Government.]

Their Government is said to be onely _Oeconomical_, each Father ordering
the Affairs of his Family apart, without subjection to any other
Superior; yet so well manag’d, that they live in good Peace one with
another; not without many good Laws and Customs, _viz._ That they allow
but one Wife to one Man; That they punish Adultery with Death; That they
suffer not Maids to talk or converse with Men till they be Married; That
Widows may not Marry till they have Mourn’d at least one half year for
their Husbands deceased; and divers others of like nature, which
perhaps, if the truth were known, do more properly belong to the Natives
of _Utopia_, or _New Atlantis_, than to these of _California_.

[Sidenote: Places of note.]

The Places therein, as yet observ’d, are onely upon the Sea-coasts, 1.
The _Capes_ of _St. Clara_ and _St. Lucas_, the one at the South-East
end of the Island, looking towards _New Gallicia_, the other at the
South-West, looking into the Sea, and towards _Asia_.

[Illustration]

2. _St. Cruce_, so nam’d from its being first discover’d on
_Holy-Rood_-Day, being a large and convenient Haven, not far from _Cape
St. Clara_.

3. _Cabo de las Playas_, so call’d from a company of little bare
Hillocks appearing from the Sea, and is more within the Bay.

4. _Cabo Baxo_, so term’d, as lying towards the bottom of the Gulf.

5. _St. Andrews_, another convenient Haven upon an Island of the same
Name.

6. _St. Thomas_, an Island at the Mouth of the Gulf or Bay, of about
twenty five Leagues in compass, rising Southerly with an high
mountainous Point, under which is a convenient Road for Shipping, and
twenty five Fathoms of Water.

On the other side of the Island, towards the Main Sea, there is 1. _St.
Abad_, a good Haven, and almost surrounded with a pleasant and fruitful
Countrey.

2. _Cape Trinidado_, a noted Promontory.

3. _Cape de Cedras_, so call’d (together with a small Island near it)
from the store of Cedars growing thereabouts.

4. _Enganno._ 5. _Puebla de las Canoas_, so nam’d from the abundance of
those little Boats which the _Americans_ generally use, and do call
_Canoos_, whereof perhaps some store are made there.

6. _Cabo de Galera_, from its resemblance to a Rat.

It is believ’d there are many more Promontories and Bays on both sides
of this Island, besides Rivers and Islets, yet not nam’d, and altogether
unknown. Moreover Dr. _Heylin_ hath well observ’d, that those
above-mention’d are the Names onely of Places, and not of Towns and
Villages, though doubtless there must needs have been some scatter’d
Houses, built formerly by the _Spaniards_ in so many Expeditions.

[Sidenote: _Cortez_ the first Discoverer of these Parts.]

The first Discoverer of these Parts was _Ferdinando Cortez_, who having
in the Year 1534. set out two Ships to that purpose from _St. Jago_, a
Haven of _New Spain_, and not finding the Success answerable to his
Expectation, went next Year himself in Person, and pass’d a good way up
the Gulf, but for want of Provisions was forc’d to return without having
done any thing to the purpose.

In 1539. one _Francisco_, a Companion of _Cortez_ in the former
Expedition, Set out upon his own Charges, and having Coasted all about,
both upon the Eastern and Western Shores, he at last Landed, but not
without notable opposition from the Natives, who with much clamour, and
many antique Gestures set upon his Men so furiously with Stones and
Arrows, that they had met with a shrew’d Repulse, had it not been for
the Valor of their Auxiliaries, the Mastiff Dogs, which it seems they
us’d to carry along with them in those kind of Voyages; but at last he
got footing so far, that he took possession in the Name of the King of
_Spain_ with the usual Formalities; and following the Example of
_Columbus_ set up a Cross in the Place for a Memorial and Testimony of
his having been there.

[Sidenote: _Marco de Nisa_ his Relation of these Parts.]

Much about the same time _Marco de Nisa_ a _Franciscan_, undertaking a
Voyage into these Parts, reported Wonders at his Return, of the plenty
of golden Mines, stately Cities, set out with magnificent Buildings, the
very Gates whereof were enrich’d with _Turquoises_, and other Precious
Stones, and whose meanest Inhabitants went glittering in Gold and Mother
of Pearl, and of the flourishing Condition of the Kingdoms of _Acu_,
_Tonteac_, and _Marata_; whereupon the Governor of _New Gallicia_ was
sent by the then Vice-Roy of _Mexico_, with great hopes of bringing back
a Confirmation of these Reports; but whether out of spite to be deceiv’d
in his Expectation, or having real cause so to do, he represented all
things as mean and despicable, as the Fryer had proclaim’d them rich and
glorious.

[Sidenote: _De Alarcon_ his Voyage.]

The next that went upon this Design was _Ferdinando de Alarcon_, who is
reported to have Sail’d many Leagues up a River call’d _Buena Guia_, and
there to have receiv’d Homage of _Naguacatus_, one of the Heads of the
_Californian_ Tribes.

[Sidenote: _Cabrillo_ his Expedition.]

One more Attempt was made in the Year 1642. by _Roderico Cabrillo_, who
discover’d the Island of _St. Luke_, and another call’d _The Island of
Possession_; and this was the last we hear of that thought it worth
while to go an Undertaker to these Coasts, and ever since all
Undertakings hither have been so wholly laid aside, that what-ever was
once discover’d in these Parts, seems rather to be lost and forgotten,
than any way improv’d.

As for _Nova Albion_, whereas many determine it to be onely the utmost
Northern part of _California_, though it doth not absolutely appear to
be so from the Relation of Sir _Francis Drake_’s Discovery of it, we
judge it agreeable to Method and Decorum not wholly to omit the mention
of it in this place, though it hath been already spoken of, and the
aforesaid Relation deliver’d at large amongst the rest of those
Provinces of largely-taken _California_, which were taken for granted to
be upon the Continent.

[Sidenote: _Drakes_ Account of the Countrey.]

_Drake_ and his Company brought home this Description of the Countrey
and its Inhabitants, _viz._ _That the Countrey was exceedingly well
stor’d with Deer, Grazing up and down the Hills by thousands in a
company; That the Men generally went naked all over, the Women using
onely a piece of a Mat, or some such thing instead an Apron; That their
Houses were built onely of Turf and Osier, yet so wrought together, that
they serv’d very well to keep out the Cold; in the midst of it was their
Hearth where they made their Fire, and lay all round about it together
upon several Beds of Bull-Rushes. What their Towns Were, or whither they
had any, is altogether unknown_.

                                CHAP. I.


[Sidenote: Situation and Form of _Southern America_.]

Having compleated our Description of _Mexicana_, or _Northern America_,
being that great _Peninsula_ which lies Northward of the _Isthmus_, or
_Straight_ of _Darien_, together with all the Islands on the North side
of the _Equinoctial Line_, we come now to the Southern Part, otherwise
call’d _Peruana_, from _Peru_ the chief Kingdom thereof, being the other
great _Peninsula_, which lies Southward of the aforesaid _Straight_: It
is generally resembled to the form of a Pyramid revers’d; the Basis
whereof, that is to say, the more Southerly parts of it towards
_Magellanica_ and the _Straights_, extend themselves largely both East
and West, becoming more sharp and streight towards the North, and those
parts by which it is joyn’d to _Mexicana_: in the whole it is suppos’d
to contain a Circuit of seventeen thousand Miles at least, and is
water’d with four of the greatest Rivers of the World, besides abundance
of lesser Streams, which issuing from the _Andes_ and other Mountains of
the Countrey, do run from all Parts both into the North and South Sea,
much fertilizing the Countreys through which they pass; the four
principal are these following:

[Sidenote: The chief Rivers thereof.]

1. _Orellana_, so call’d from the first Discovery thereof by _Franciscus
de Orellana_, otherwise the River of _Amazons_, from a Generation of
warlike Women, who (as the Tradition goes) inhabited certain Countreys
lying upon the Banks thereof. This riseth in the Province of _Peru_, and
runneth a Course of little less than five thousand Miles, discharging it
self at last into the North Sea, through a Channel, as some say, of
threescore Leagues broad, and yet with such a violent Current or Stream,
that it is said to keep its natural colour and taste almost thirty Miles
in the Sea.

2. _Orenoque_, by some call’d _Raliana_, from Sir _Walter Raleigh_, who
endeavor’d to discover it, a River of the Province of _Guiana_, whose
Head or Spring is not yet discover’d: It is said to be Navigable a
thousand Miles together by the tallest Ships, and no less than two
thousand by Pinnaces and smaller Vessels, and dischargeth it self
likewise into the North Sea by sixteen several Channels or Mouths,
making thereby several Islands; some whereof are said to be of good
bigness, and to lie at a distance of a hundred Miles or more one from
the other.

3. _Maragnon_, a River of a yet larger Course than any of the former,
being, as ’tis said, no less than six thousand Miles from its Head,
which is out of the _Andes_ in _Peru_, to its Fall, which is likewise
into the North Sea about _Cape Blanco_, by a Channel of seventy Leagues
in breadth.

4. _Rio de la Plata_, otherwise call’d _Paraguay_, a River of two
thousand Miles Course, and falling as the rest into the North Sea, by a
Channel of threescore Miles over, and about thirty Degrees Southward of
the _Line_, towards the _Straights_ of _Magellane_.

[Sidenote: The Mountains _Andes_.]

The _Andes_, or Mountains before mention’d being the most noted, and
biggest of all _America_, and indeed of the whole World, and thought by
_Cortesius_ to be the same with _Sephar_, spoken of in the tenth Chapter
of _Genesis_, run above a thousand Leagues in length from _Timama_, a
Town of _New Granada_ in the Province of _Popayan_, and are in the
narrowest place about twenty Leagues broad; and also of equal heighth
with, if not higher than _Caucasus_ it self: the Ascent to them is
unpassable, except in very few places, by reason of craggy Precipices,
and wild overgrown pathless Woods, serving onely for a shelter to
Serpents and other poysonous Animals, which are there so numerous, that
a whole Army of one of the Kings of _Peru_ is reported to have been
destroy’d by them; and what-ever People there are inhabiting in any of
these Woods and Fastnesses, must needs be in the very utmost degree of
rude and brutish salvageness.

Some divide _Southern America_ into _Peruviana_ and _Brasiliana_:
_Peruviana_ they subdivide into _Terra Firma_ and _Peru_; _Brasiliana_
into _Brasile_ and _Paraguay_: But the most receiv’d and commodious
Division is into these particular Provinces following, all of them
wealthy and large, _viz._ 1. _Castella Aurea_, or _Golden Castile_, 2.
_Nova Granada_, or _The New Kingdom_, as they call it. 3. _Peru_,
specially so call’d. 4. _Chile._ 5. _Paraguay._ 6. _Brasile._ 7.
_Guiana._ 8. Lastly _Paria_, with some lesser Islands adjoyning to all
or most of these Provinces, and commonly reckon’d as part of them.

             Castella Aurea, otherwise call’d Terra Firma.


[Sidenote: Description of _Castella Aurea_.]

_Castella de Oro_, as the _Spaniards_ call it, or _Golden Castile_,
taketh up all the rest of the _Isthmus_, or _Straight_ of _Darien_,
which hath not been yet spoken of, being bounded Eastward, and to the
North-East, with the _Atlantick_ Ocean; and on the West with _Mare del
Zur_, and some part of _Veragua_; Southward it hath the new Kingdom of
_Granada_. It is call’d sometimes _Terra Firma_, because it was one of
the first parts of firm Land which the _Spaniards_ touch’d upon, after
they had pass’d so many Islands, as seem’d for some time to block up,
and bar them from the Continent of _America_: It is subdivided into
these inferior Provinces or Countreys, _viz._ 1. _Panama._ 2. _Darien._
3. _Nova Andaluzia._ 4. _St. Martha._ 5. Lastly, the little Province _De
la Hacha_.

[Sidenote: Rivers.]

The chief Rivers of the Province of _Panama_ are 1: _Chagre_, as it was
antiently call’d, but afterwards from the great number of Crocodiles
that harbor in it, _Rio de Lagartos_, falling into the North Sea between
_Nombre de Dios_ and _Porto Bellano_. 2. _Sardinilla._ 3. _Sardina._ 4.
_Rio de Colubros_, so call’d from the abundance of Snakes breeding
thereabouts. 5. _Rio de Comagre_, which falls into the same Sea. 6.
_Chepo_, famous in times past for its Gold-Sands. 7. _Rio de Balsas_,
whose Banks are shaded with good Timber-Trees. 8. _Rio de Congo_, which
falls into _St. Michaels_ Bay.


                               SECT. II.
                                Panama.

[Sidenote: Description of _Panama_.]

_Panama_, commonly call’d _The District_, or _Circle of Panama_, is
bounded Eastward with the _Gulf_, or _Bay_ of _Urraba_, by which it is
separated from the rest of the Continent of this Southern part of
_America_; on the West it hath _Veragua_, one of the Provinces of
_Guatimala_; being on both the other sides wash’d with the Sea: It is
suppos’d to contain in length from _Carthagena_ and _Popayan_, to the
Confines of _Veragua_, about eighty or ninety Leagues, in breadth not
above threescore in any part; and where it is narrowest, _viz._ betwixt
the City of _Panama_ and _Nombre de Dios_, if measur’d by a right Line,
not above six or seven over from Sea to Sea. It lieth almost under the
_Equinoctial Line_, but a few Degrees Northward of it, and therefore
somewhat hot, and by the neighborhood of both Seas subject to a foggy
and gross Air, in comparison of some other parts; so that it is not
counted generally so healthful a Countrey, especially for Strangers, and
in Summer-time.

[Sidenote: The antient Division of _Panama_.]

The antient Division of _Panama_, according to the Lordships of the
_Casiques_ that then Govern’d, were these following: _Careta_, _Aila_,
_Comagre_, _Chiam_, _Coyba_, _Chame_, _Chiru_, _Nata_, _Tobre_, _Trota_,
_Haylia_, _Burica_, and _Escotia_, where the South Sea with the
Spring-Tides flowing over the Plains, at its return being hardned by the
Sea, is turn’d into Salt; but as it hath always hapned in all other
Countreys of the World, that with the alteration of Government, the
Division of the Countrey, and the Names of Places have totally chang’d,
so also here the antient Division of Regions and Territories must give
place to the Modern.

[Sidenote: The Nature and Customs of the antient Inhabitants.]

The antient Inhabitants of these Parts were a very warlike People, the
Women always accompanying their Husbands in the Wars. They us’d to hang
on the tops of their Standards the Bones of their greatest Heroes,
thereby to animate their Soldiers. Their Arms consisted of poysonous
Arrows, Stone Swords, and Pikes made of the Palm-Trees. They also
carried with them the Idol _Chiapa_, to whom they Offer’d living
Children at the beginning of their Wars, and afterwards making Merry
with the Flesh, anointed the Image with the Blood: Moreover, if they
return’d home Conquerors, they spent several days in all manner of
Debaucheries, as Drinking, Singing, Dancing, Cutting their Prisoners
Throats, with their Blood also anointing their Image. But if they were
conquer’d, then they invented new Offerings to reconcile themselves with
their Idol.

[Sidenote: Towns and Places of chief note.]

The chief Towns and Places which the _Spaniards_ inhabit here, are 1.
_Panama_, the chief City of the Province, being also a Bishop’s See,
which is Suffragan to the Arch-bishop of _Lima_, and the ordinary
Residence of the Governor and Courts of Justice for these Parts; It is
seated likewise upon the South Sea, and so near, that at High-water the
Ships are said to Ride even under the Walls. Through this Town the
Wealth both of _Peru_ and _Spain_ passeth once every Year; from _Spain_
by _Nombre de Dios_ and _Porto Bello_, from whence whatsoever
Merchandise or other Commodities come from _Spain_, are Transported to
_Panama_ by Land, and from thence by Sea to all the Parts of _Peru_; and
by _Panama_ whatsoever comes from _Peru_, is sent into _Spain_: It hath
commonly a strong Garrison of Soldiers in it, and is doubtless a Place
otherwise well fortifi’d, being of so great importance. From the Haven
_Pericos_ three Ways lead to _Panama_, the first along a Bridge over a
River, whose Banks are great Fortifications to the City, the rather
because the River is deep, and next to it a Pool over-grown with Weeds.
The Way from _Nombre de Dios_ plain and without Woods, is wash’d by the
Brook _Levendero_. The third runs along over a Stone Bridge and Champain
Grounds, that extend from the Haven _Pericos_ to the City. Eastward from
_Panama_ appear seven Royal Houses on a Rock, wherein the Courts of
Judicature are kept. Five hundred Rods into the Sea lies an Island
resembling a Half-Moon, and the Haven wherein the Ships when they unlade
cast Anchor, there being else not Water enough for laden Barques, and
all lie dry, the Tide being out: At the Mouth thereof stands a woodden
Sconce. The Places _Venta de Cruze_, _Chagre_, _Quebrada_, and
_Ballano_, are also fortifi’d against any Invasion, where else an Enemy
might easily Land: But the strictest Watch is kept at the River
_Chagre_, which Westward below _Nombre de Dios_ falling into the
Northern Ocean, brings the Ships up to _Venta de Cruze_, from whence a
Way scarce five Leagues long leads to _Panama_. The _Spanish_
Commodities consisting most in Meal, Oyl, Biskets, Cloth and Silk, are
all brought from _Nombre de Dios_ along the same Way; or else in Winter
when they cannot stem the Current of the River _Chagre_, then they bring
their Goods by Land, not without great danger of being taken by the
run-away _Negro_’s, who set upon them out of the Woods with poyson’d
Darts and Arrows; and as many _Spaniards_ as they take, so many several
ways they put them to death, because they formerly in the time of their
Servitude were us’d with all imaginable Cruelties. The Provisions sold
here at a reasonable Rate are _Maiz_, _Peruan_-Meal, Poultrey, Honey,
Cattel, Swine, Oranges, Lemmons, Cabbage, and all manner of Garden Herbs
or Plants. Round about the fore-mention’d Royal Houses lie Bulwarks,
with a strong Castle on one side. A fair Cathedral denotes the Place to
be a Bishop’s See: And the _Franciscans_, _Dominicans_, and Monks of the
Order _De la Merced_, inhabit several fair Cloysters here. Two Leagues
Westward is the Haven _Pericos_, which being secur’d from all Winds by
three high Isles that lie before it, is the chief Harbor in which the
_Peruan_ Plate-Fleet (consisting most in small Barques) comes to an
Anchor before they touch at _Panama_. The Countrey is for the most part
Mountainous, and in many places sends forth stinking Damps out of muddy
Pools; yet in some places are _Savanna_ Grounds for Cattel to Graze in.
The Air would also be more unhealthful, if it were not clear’d by the
Winds which blow from the Sea. From _July_ to _October_ there fall
continual Rains, mix’d with terrible claps of Thunder. The Inhabitants
often recreate themselves in Hunting wild Hogs, with Nets made of the
Brambles call’d _Nequen_ or _Henachen_, and that after a strange manner:
for they set on fire the Bushes all about the place where they suppose
the Game to lie, which to shun the fire runs into their Nets; so that
the same Bushes are both their shelter and destruction, as affording
Material to make the Nets wherein they are taken. Besides other Birds
the Woods also abound with Pheasants and Turtle-Doves; and amongst
Beasts, those that carry their Young about them in a Bag, as also
wildcats. The Sea abounds with Fish, and produces Crocodiles of a large
size, by the _Spaniards_ call’d _Lagartos_. The Trees are seldom without
Leaves, but bear little or no Fruit.

2. _Nombre de Dios_, which hath broad Streets, high woodden Houses, and
a fair Church: It extends from East to West along the Northern Ocean, in
the middle of a great Wood on Moorish Ground, having a great Fen on the
West; being situate under an unwholsom Climate, it hath occasion’d the
death of many People. The Merchants which dwelt here had also
Habitations in _Panama_, (the rest of the Houses being most of them Inns
for Strangers) from whence as soon as they had gotten an Estate they
went to _Spain_. The Countrey round about lies under Water in many
places. The Oranges, _Cassada_-Roots, and the like, which grow here,
occasion many Distempers to those that eat of them. In the Harbor, which
hath on each side a Ridge of Rocks, on which lies decay’d Forts, the Sea
is often-times so turbulent, that the Ships are forc’d to Ride at six
Anchors apiece. Eastward from the City a fresh-Water River falls into
the Haven, on whose Banks stand several Garden-Houses and Orchards.
_Anno 1595._ Sir _Francis Drake_ arriving here, found a Mill beyond the
City; not far from which on a Hill stood a Watch-house, of which having
made himself Master, he set fire on the Town _Nombre de Dios_, as also
on all the Vessels that were in the Harbor. The original of the Name
_Nombre de Dios_ was on this occasion, _viz._ _Diego Niquesa_ setting
Sail with three Ships out of the Haven _Carthagena_ to the Golden
Countrey _Veragua_, was surpris’d by a violent Storm, in which two
Ketches, Commanded by _Lupus de Olano_ and _Peter Umbria_ were driven
out of sight, whilest he suffer’d shipwrack, and getting ashore, rang’d
up and down in a desolate Countrey, where he found no other Food but
Roots, till at last he met with _Olano_; when the Famine began to
increase amongst them in such a nature, that being scarce able to carry
their Arms, many of them were kill’d by the Inhabitants with poyson’d
Arrows, insomuch that of seven hundred there remain’d scarce ninety:
_Niquesa_ shipp’d as many of them in a new Vessel which they had made as
it could possibly carry, and promis’d to fetch the rest off from
_Veragua_ as soon as he had discover’d a Place fit to be inhabited: The
first Place he Landed at was _Puerto Bello_; from whence being
necessitated by the _Indians_ who gather’d together to Retreat Aboard,
not without the loss of several Men, he set Sail to the Promontory
_Mormor_, beyond which he Anchor’d in a secure Haven; where, as he was
going ashore he call’d to his Men, saying, _Saltiamo in tierra al Nombre
de Dios_, that is, _Let us Land in the Name of God_, and calling up a
Fort against the Assaults of the Natives, call’d it _Nombre de Dios_.

3. _St. Philip_, or _Puerto Bello_, so denominated by _Christopher
Columbus_ from its Haven lying along the North Sea, wonderful convenient
and secure, by reason of the good Ground for Anchoring, and a Creek in
the same, defended from all sorts of Winds; and which being surrounded
with Woods, hath much over-flow’d Land about it, as also abundance of
good Gravel for Ballast; for which and several other Reasons, the famous
Architect _Baptista Antonelli_ advis’d the _Spanish_ King, to build this
City for a Staple of Trade (in stead of _Nombre de Dios_, which was
found unhealthy) having pitch’d upon an excellent Situation for it,
_viz._ on a Plain at the Foot of a Hill, where there are three fresh
Rivulets, meeting with a fruitful and hot Countrey: wherefore his Advice
being taken, they first built a Fort at the Mouth of the Haven, put five
Guns into the same to defend the new City, and on the Shore a strong
Tower with eight Drakes: Moreover, the Rocks along the Shore, and close
Woods about the Haven prevent the Landing of an Enemy: But at the very
time that this City was just begun to be built, Sir _Francis Drake_
having burnt _Nombre de Dios_, ran into the Haven _Puerto Bello_, where
he found ten Houses, besides the Governors Palace, and a Castle whose
Breast-works which the _Spaniards_ had lately rais’d of Timber, Stone,
and Earth, were all demolish’d by the _English_: But the _Spaniards_
have since re-built the same, and fortifi’d the Haven, with two strong
Castles, notwithstanding in the Year 1661. it was surpriz’d and taken by
the _English_ under the Command of Captain _Parker_, and the Governor
_Petro Melendez_ taken Prisoner.

4. _Nata_, commonly call’d _St. Jago de Nata_, situated on the West side
of this Province, upon _Mare del Zur_, or _The South Sea_, about thirty
Leagues distant from _Panama_, towards the Borders of _Veragua_.

5. _Acla_, a Town upon the same Coast, but lying South-East of _Nombre
de Dios_: It was at first onely a Fort built by _Peter de Arias_, but
afterwards grew up into a small City, of which at present there is
nothing remaining but the remembrance of the famous _Vasquez Nunnez_,
Beheaded by his Father-in-law _Arias_.

6. Lastly, _La Crux Real_, a few Leagues distant from _Panama_, for the
most part inhabited by a sort of _Negro_’s call’d _Simmerones_.

Along the North Coast of _Panama_ are two small woody Islands call’d
_Cattiva_ and _Comagre_, lying low in the Water; also the Isle _De
Pines_, which rises high out of the Sea near the Main Land.

[Sidenote: The _Isles of Pearls_.]

On the Southern Coast are _Isole de las Perlas_, or _The Isles of
Pearls_, about twenty five in number, but indeed rather Rocks than
Islands, excepting two, _viz._ _Tararequi_ and _Del Rios_ where in
former times the _Indians_ took great store of Pearls, by diving for
them to the bottom of the Sea; and they were esteem’d of greater value
and excellence than those of _Cubagua_, and great profit was made of
them by the _Spaniards_, till by their Cruelties exercis’d upon the
Natives through excessive greediness, they depopulated the Islands, and
lost that altogether of which before they were so insatiable: they are
now onely inhabited by a few _Moors_ and other Slaves, who keep Cattel
there for their Masters.

[Sidenote: Captain _Oxenham_’s Expedition.]

It will not seem amiss to conclude our Description of _Panama_ with a
short Account of the _English_ Captain _John Oxenham_’s Exploits in
these Parts: He being incited by the Treasure which Sir _Francis Drake_
fetch’d from hence, resolv’d to Steer for the Northern Coast of
_Panama_, where he hal’d his Ship of a hundred and twenty Tun on Shore,
and cover’d the same with Trees, buried his Guns, and march’d with two
Field-Pieces and seven Men up into the Countrey, and was by the
_Indians_ conducted to a River which falls into the South Sea, where he
built a Pinnace of forty five Foot long, and Sailing into the South Sea,
Landed on _Tararequi_, one of the Islands of _Pearls_; where he soon
after took a _Peruan_ Barque with sixty thousand pieces of Gold, store
of Wine and Bread, and the day following another which came from _Lima_,
loaden with a hundred thousand Pound in Silver Bars, and some Pearls;
with which being enrich’d he return’d to the Main: The Governor of
_Panama_ being inform’d of it, put a hundred Soldiers into four Barques,
besides a considerable number of _Negro_ Slaves; over which _Juan de
Ortego_ having the chief Command, was inform’d at _Tararequi_ what
Course the _English_ had steer’d; whereupon he pursu’d them to the River
whither they were gone, which falling with three Arms into the Sea, they
could not have known which way the _English_ went, unless they had seen
some Feathers of Fowls driving in the Mouth of the least Branch, by
which they judg’d that they were not far off; therefore Rowing up they
found after four days Journey the Pinnace hal’d on Shore, and watch’d by
six Men, who were order’d to stand Sentinel, whereof one being shot by
the _Spaniards_, the other five fled; whom _Ortega_ pursuing, found half
a League from the Shore a Hut made of Boughs, wherein the Booty lay,
which he speedily carried to his Barques; but Captain _Oxenham_ inform’d
hereof, fell with two hundred _Indians_ upon the _Spaniards_, who having
a Wood on their Backs made such advantage thereof, that eleven _English_
were slain, and seven taken, and had not the rest fled, they had all
been either kill’d or taken Prisoners: Those that were taken inform’d
_Ortega_ that they had been at difference amongst themselves about
dividing the Booty, which was the reason of their staying so long:
moreover, they discover’d where and how their Ship lay; all which the
Governor of _Panama_ writ to _Nombre de Dios_; from whence four Sail
were immediately sent to find out the Ship and the buried Guns, as also
to take all such _English_ as they should find preparing of Boats or
Barques, and bring them to _Panama_; whereupon very many were taken, who
were all miserably slain, except a few Youths.


                               SECT. III.
                                Darien.

[Sidenote: Description of _Darien_.]

_Darien_, which by some Authors not being thought considerable enough to
make a distinct Province, is reckon’d one and the same with, or at least
part of, _Panama_, hath on the North the District or Circle of _Panama_;
on the South, the new Kingdom of _Granada_; Eastward it is bounded with
the Gulf of _Urraba_ abovesaid, and some part of the River _Darien_,
which giveth Name to the Province; and to the West, with the South Sea;
of a more temperate Air by far than that of _Panama_, and a Soil so
admirably fruitful and lusty, that they say Melons, Cucumbers, and
generally all other Fruits of the Garden, are ripe and fit to gather
within twenty days or less, after their first sowing, but very much
infested by noxious Creatures, as Lyons, Leopards, wild Cats,
Crocodiles, Serpents, and Bats, after whose Bitings a Man bleeds to
death, unless he washes the Wound well with Sea-water, or stop it with
hot Ashes; and no less by the unwholsomness of the Air, which is
infested by the many stinking Damps that arise from the muddy Pools. The
Inhabitants are sickly, and seeming generally to be troubled with the
Yellow Jaundice, never attain to a great Age: they go naked, the Men
onely covering their Privities with a Shell or Cotton-Cloth: The Women
wear a Cloth which reaches from the Middle down to their Knees, but if
Women of Quality, to their Feet.

[Sidenote: _Sebastian_ and _Antiqua_, by whom built.]

The _Spaniards_ have many years ago made themselves Masters of this
Province of _Darien_, in which _Alphonsus Fogeda_ built the City
_Sebastian_, which was inhabited till a _Spanish_ Knight call’d
_Ancisius_, _Anno 1510._ built _Antiqua_, and made it a Bishop’s See,
which by reason of the unwholsomness of the Place was remov’d to
_Panama_, when _Vasquez Nunnez_ discover’d the Southern Ocean, _Anno
1590._ because _Antiqua_ lay on a low Ground between high Mountains,
where the Sun burnt exceedingly, and the Way to the South Sea, being
three Leagues from thence, it was very troublesom to convey Merchandise
thither.

But a worse Accident befell the Town _St. Cruiz_, which being built by
the _Spanish_ Captain _Peter de Arias_, was ruin’d by the _Indians_.

[Sidenote: Rivers.]

The chief Rivers are 1. _Darien_, which gives Name both to the Province
and the Provincial Town, and falls into the Gulf of _Urraba_, being a
large Arm of the Sea, eight Leagues over at the Mouth thereof. 2. _Rio
de las Redas_, which runs in like manner through the Province of _Nova
Andaluzia_, and falls also into the same Gulf. So likewise doth 3. _Rio
de la Trepadera._ 4. _Corobaci._ 5. _Beru_, chiefly remarkable upon this
Consideration, that some curious Etymologists have endeavor’d to derive
the Name of _Peru_ from this River, by the alteration onely of the
initial Letter.

[Sidenote: Places of chief note.]

The chief, and indeed the onely Town of this Tract is _Darien_, built as
aforesaid by _Encisus_, a _Spanish_ Adventurer, and by him call’d _St.
Maria Antiqua_, and by others _The Antique of Darien_, being one of the
first Towns that were built by the _Spaniards_ on the firm Land; though
there are who make mention of two other small Towns or Villages, the one
nam’d at least, if not built by the _Spaniards_, viz. _Los Angelos_,
scarce inhabited at present by any but the Salvages; the other an
antient Town of the Natives, call’d _Bizu_.


                               SECT. IV.
                             New Andaluzia.

[Sidenote: Description of _New Andaluzia_.]

Eastward of _Darien_ and the Gulf of _Urraba_, lieth the Countrey of
_New Andaluzia_, otherwise call’d _Carthagena_, from the Name of its
principal City: On the East it hath the Countrey call’d _St. Martha_; on
the North, the Main Ocean; and _New Granada_ towards the South. It is
for the most part a Mountainous Countrey, and full of Woods, which they
say yield abundance of Rozen, Gums, and some very good Balsams; also a
sort of Long-pepper, much sharper than that of _East-India_. But the
Plains, by reason of much Rain, to which the Countrey is subject,
especially for some times of the year, of but a spewy and cold Soil. The
_Spaniards_ at their first coming found it a rich Countrey, not so much
from the Nature and Profits of the Soil (though it be said to have some
Mines in it, and those of Gold) but by reason of a certain Opinion and
Respect, which the _Americans_ of these Parts are generally said to have
born towards this Countrey, insomuch that they would be brought and
buried there from other Places very remote; and according to the Custom
of the Countrey, not without good store of Gold and other Jewels,
according to the Quality and Condition of the Person that was buried; of
which the _Spaniards_ soon gain’d Intelligence, and in ransacking the
Graves and Monuments of the Dead, are suppos’d to have found an infinite
Mass of Treasure: but those Mines are long since exhausted.

[Sidenote: Nature and Customs of the antient Inhabitants.]

The Inhabitants of old suffer’d great prejudice by Tygers and Serpents;
yet nevertheless this Countrey was very populous before the _Spaniards_
arrival here; the Natives wore Cotton Aprons before, and Golden Rings
about their Arms and Legs, as also Strings of Pearl, and the like. The
Women here, as in the rest of these Parts, went with their Husbands into
the Wars, and behav’d themselves valiantly, shooting poyson’d Arrows,
insomuch that _Martin Ambesus_ took a Maid, _Anno 1509._ who had kill’d
twenty eight _Spaniards_.

[Sidenote: The Countrey _Urraba_.]

To the Province _Carthagena_ belongs also the Countrey _Urraba_, which
is so fruitful, that all kind of _Spanish_ Trees and Seeds grow better
here than in _Spain_: Besides which it hath its own Fruit, as also
abundance of Pine and Palm-Trees, whose Leaves serve for Brooms. The
_Guaiana_-Tree bears a sharp kind of Fruit like a Lemmon, the
_Guaravana_ a kind of Cittrons, the _Mameisa_ a Fruit not unlike an
Orange, but tasting like a Melon, and the _Hovos_ a great Plum.

Their Gardens abound with the Root _Batata_, whose Leaves send forth
several Strings, which over-spreading the Ground fasten in the Earth,
and take new Roots; it is yellow without, and whitish within, and bears
pale green Flowers, which at last turn to a Cod full of Seed. These
Roots roasted in hot Ashes, exceed our _European_ Turnip; and beaten and
put in Water till it works over, makes a Drink, with which the _Indians_
Drink and Carouse till they are Drunk.

[Illustration: CARTAGENA]

[Sidenote: A strange Beast.]

Moreover, _Urraba_ abounds in Venison, Fish, and all sorts of ravenous
Creatures, as Tygers, Lyons, and a particular strange Beast as big as an
Ox, having an Elephants Nose, Horses Feet, and hanging Ears.

The Trees likewise swarm with Birds; and especially near Lakes or Pools
breed Pheasants and Parrots, of which some are bigger than Capons,
others no bigger than Chickens.

[Sidenote: The Mountain _Abibe_.]

Against _Urraba_ juts the Mountain _Abibe_, whose length Westward
remains unknown; the breadth thereof in some places is about twenty
Leagues; it hath many Ways which cannot be travell’d with Horses. The
top of this Mountain is uninhabited; but along the Valleys, which are
many and large, dwelt formerly a People that possess’d great Riches in
Gold, which they gather’d out of Rivulets that fell Westward from the
tops of the Mountains. It Rains here almost all the year long, which
makes the Ways very bad for Travellers to pass.

At the Foot of this Mountain, towards the South, lie two small antient
Casiquedoms, if we may so call them, formerly inhabited by a valiant
People, call’d _Tarabe de Zenu_, whether chiefly the dead Bodies were
brought from all the adjacent Countreys, to be buried in great State, as
hath been before intimated.

[Sidenote: Towns and Places of principal note.]

[Sidenote: The Description of _Carthagena_.]

The principal Towns and Places of note are 1. _Carthagena_, (so call’d
either from the resemblance of its Situation with the City _Carthagena_
in the Kingdom of _Murcia_ belonging to _Old Spain_, or because the
first Inhabitants were Citizens of the said City) which was begun to be
built _Anno 1532._ by _Peter de Heredia_, but fully finished by _Georgio
Robledo_, eight years after the first Foundation thereof was laid. This
Episcopal Metropolis is on the North wash’d by the North Sea over a
plain shallow Ground; on the Land side the Sea flows through a narrow
Bay by the City towards the Lake _Canupote_, which ebbs and flows equal
with the Ocean, and receives and discharges its Water through two Pipes
which lie under a long Bridge, joyning _Carthagena_ to the Main Coast.
This City boasted long since above five hundred Stone Houses, being
divided into twenty six large Streets, whereof four are six hundred and
twenty Paces long: behind each House is a Garden; and the Church appears
above all the other Buildings: The _Dominicans_ Cloyster is also fairly
built; neither is the _Franciscans_ inferior to it, who also possess a
second Edifice on the Main Continent over the Bridge. The Custom-house
and Court where the Courts for the whole Province of _Carthagena_ are
kept, are also stately Structures. The Haven hath two Entrances, the
chiefest whereof lies half a League Eastward from the City, and the
Western, call’d _La Boca_, is as far again; both very dangerous, because
of the many blind Rocks that lie before them. _Anno 1585._ when Sir
_Francis Drake_ took _Carthagena_ by Storm, the whole was fortifi’d with
Sconces, besides two Forts for the better security thereof, whereof one
lock’d up the narrow Mouth of the Haven with a strong Chain; not far
from which stood an Abbey, Dedicated to the _Franciscans_, and Wall’d
round about; since which they have several Out-works, Forts and Towers,
to prevent all foreign Invasions. The City grows wealthy daily by the
_Peruan_ Plate-Fleet putting in there before they go to _Spain_, and
especially by the Trade from _New Granada_ along the River _Magdalena_.
The Island before the Haven, antiently call’d _Codega_, now _Carex_,
inhabited by Fisher-men when the _Spaniards_ Landed there, is now
desolate, the remainder of those that were destroy’d by them being fled
to wild places from the _Spaniards_ Cruelties; notwithstanding the
People hereabouts were valiant enough to Engage with them. But since the
Devastation made by Sir _Francis Drake_, _Carthagena_ hath receiv’d a
more fatal Blow; for it was scarce fully repair’d, when five _French_
Privateers burnt the City to Ashes: which Mischief was occasion’d by a
_Spanish_ Seaman, who being whipt by Command of the Governor, resolving
for Revenge, went from _Spain_ to _France_, and conducted the
fore-mention’d Ships to _Carthagena_, where he reveng’d himself on the
Governor; for finding him asleep, he first wak’d him, and after having
told him of his causing him to be Whipt, he kill’d him. The Booty which
the _Spaniards_ carried from thence at that time amounted to above a
hundred and fifty thousand _Ducats_.

[Sidenote: The Balsam of _Tolu_ very famous.]

2. _Tolu_, by the _Spaniards_ now call’d _St. Jago_, twelve Leagues
distant from _Carthagena_, a Place memorable for the excellent Balsam
which is brought from thence, and commonly call’d _The Balsam of Tolu_;
it is gather’d in a Spoonful of black Wax, stuck under the Hole cut in
the Bark of a low Pine-Tree, out of which in hot Weather runs a Golden
colour’d Gum, very soveraign, and of an excellent smell.

3. _St. Crux de Mopox_, a neat Town, seated a little above the
confluence of the two Rivers, _St. Martha_ and _Magdalena_, which waters
this Province.

4. _Baranca de Nolambo_, a Place of great Traffick, especially for all
Commodities of the new Kingdom of _Granada_; it standeth upon the Banks
of the River _Magdalena_, and about six Leagues distant from the Sea.

5. _Buena Vista_, otherwise call’d _St. Sebastian de Buena Vista_, a
Town commodiously seated upon a rising Ground not far from the Gulf of
_Urraba_, or the Sound of _Darien_, about a League and a half from the
Sea.

6. _Villa de St. Maria_, thirty Leagues Southward of _Carthagena_.

[Sidenote: Rivers of _Carthagena_.]

The Province of _Carthagena_ is stor’d with many Brooks and great
Rivers, amongst which the Stream _Cauca_ falls into the River
_Magdalena_, beyond _Popayan_ near _Mopox_.

The River _Zenu_, which gives Denomination to the above-mention’d
Territory, makes a very convenient Harbor with its Mouth, where much
Salt is to be had.

The _Daria_, which runs between _Panama_ and _Carthagena_ into the Inlet
_Urraba_, gives its Denomination to the foregoing Province, through
which it also runs, as hath been already mention’d.

The River which for its greatness is call’d _Rio Grande_, or
_Magdalena_, (because it was discover’d on the Day Consecrated to that
Saint) falls with such force into the Northern Ocean, about twenty three
Leagues Eastward from _Carthagena_, that running two Leagues broad and
ten long into the Sea, it retains its freshness of Water; in which there
lying many Rocks, makes the same very dangerous for Ships. In the Mouth
of the Haven lies an Island, which is divided by the River, the widest
and most frequented Channel of which respects _St. Martha_, where those
that carry the Merchandise up this Stream to _New Granada_, spend two
Moneths in Toeing, whenas they come from thence in three Weeks.

Thunder and Lightning rages here many times after a terrible manner from
Midnight till Morning. In _January_ there falls also abundance of Rain,
which gliding from the Mountains swells the River exceedingly.

                              St. Martha.

[Sidenote: Description of _St. Martha_.]

_St. Martha_, so call’d from the chief City of the Province, is border’d
on the West with _New Andaluzia_; on the East, with _Rio de la Hacha_;
on the North, with the Ocean; and on the South, with _New Granada_; It
is about threescore and ten Leagues in length, and not much less in
breadth: It was antiently distributed into several little _Seignories_,
Govern’d by _Casiques_, or petty Princes, _viz._ _Pozigueica_, _Betoma_,
_Buritaca_, _Chimola_, inhabited by valiant Men and beautiful Women, and
above all the rest, _Tairona_, (whose People for a long time maintain’d
War against the _Spaniards_) lying at the Foot of the high Mountains
_Sierras Nevadas_, whose snowy Crowns are seen thirty Leagues off at
Sea, and run along in a continu’d Ridge through _Peru_ and _Chili_ to
the _Straights_ of _Magellan_.

This Countrey was Discover’d, and part of it Planted, _Anno 1524._ by
_Roderic de Bastredas_, who afterwards was murder’d in his Sleep by his
own People.

[Sidenote: The Nature of the Climate, and Commodities of the Countrey.]

The Sun shines so exceeding hot near the Sea-coast, that there is no
enduring of the same; but up in the Countrey the snowy Mountains
occasion great Cold, and in Harvest and _October_ it Rains exceedingly,
whereas at other times it is very dry Weather, and the Winds blow
generally out of the East or North-East, yet the Land-Breezes coming out
of the West bring sometimes Rains with them. From the Mountains, which
are stony and barren, fall many Brooks and Rivers, which water divers
Plains, the Grass and other Plants of which are often blasted by violent
Storms; nevertheless Oranges, Lemmons, Granates, and all sorts of
_Spanish_ Garden Fruits grow here in great plenty. The Woods afford
likewise Pigeons, Partridges, Venison, and the like; the Rivers all
manner of Fish, which are seen to swim in great numbers twenty Yards
under the Water, especially in the Haven _St. Martha_, near which
formerly liv’d many Fisher-men, who with Nets made of tough Twigs
pleited together, caught such plenty of Fish, that they furnish’d all
their Neighbors. The High-ways are made dangerous by Lyons, Tygers, and
Bears.

[Sidenote: Great plenty of Precious Stones in these Parts.]

[Sidenote: _Peter di Lugo_ his Treachery to the Natives.]

[Sidenote: The _Welsares_ Journey.]

The Countrey _Buritaca_ affords the Inhabitants Gold; _Tairona_,
excellent Stones against Bleeding and the Gravel, Jasper, Porphyr, and
Gold; the Valley _Tunia_, many rich Emeraulds, which Stones us’d to be
in great esteem before _America_ produc’d such great numbers of them.
_Acosta_ relates, That a _Spaniard_ desiring to know the Price of an
Emerauld, shew’d two to an _Italian_ Jeweller, who valu’d the one at a
hundred, the other at three hundred _Ducats_; but soon after seeing a
Chest full of them, said they were scare worth a _Ducat_ apiece; and
that the Sute which the _Roman_ Lady wore, being beset with Emeraulds,
and valu’d at four hundred thousand _Ducats_, would not sell now for
half so much. This Stone or Jewel exceedingly fortifies the Sight,
wherefore the Emperor _Nero_ represented the bloody Encounters of
Fencers in an Emerauld. It is also judg’d to be good against the
Falling-sickness, wherefore the _Indians_ hang them in their Noses to
this day, and adorn their Idols with them; they grow in stony Rocks
along Veins, not unlike Crystal, and in time obtain a glittering
Greenness; the biggest of them that are found in this Age are most
esteem’d of in _Genua_. The Emerauld Pillar, which as a wonderful
Ornament stood in _Hercules_’s Temple in the City of _Tyrus_, being very
famous amongst the Antients, was without doubt no more than a green
Stone; and perhaps of the same Material, was the Pillar erected by the
_Arabian_ King _Miramamolines_, in the Cathedral at _Corduba_. But the
great fame of these Emeraulds incited _Gonzalvez Zimenes_, Governor of
_St. Martha_, to leave his Place and seek for them; to which end he
Sail’d up the Rivulet _Gayra_ with two Ketches and forty five
_Spaniards_, who meeting with the Casique _Bagotta_, got much Gold of
him, and afterwards went to the Valley _Tessuca_; of which _Simandoca_
being Governor, conducted _Ximenez_ twenty three Leagues farther to an
Emerauld Rock, from whence he return’d exceedingly enriched; the rumor
of which spreading up and down, made several travel thither; amongst
whom was _Peter di Lugo_, Governor of _Terra Firma_, who sending for Aid
from _Carthagena_, fought his way to _Bagotta_, who resisted him for
some time, till at last being defeated he made Peace with them for a
considerable quantity of Gold; which when _Peter di Lugo_ had receiv’d,
not regarding his Word, he plunder’d all the Countrey, and having
committed all imaginable Cruelties on the Natives, return’d home with an
invaluable Mass of Gold and Emeraulds to _St. Martha_. Not long after
the _Welsares_, _German_ Knights, came from _Venezuela_, (which City the
Emperor _Charles_ the Fifth Morgag’d to them _Anno 1518._) and travell’d
through the snowy Mountains of _St. Martha_ with _Indian_ Guides, whose
Instructions following, they digg’d many Emeraulds out of the Valley
_Funia_; the Inhabitants of which affrighted at the sight of the
Strangers, hang’d themselves out of despair, though naturally valiant,
and ingenious in working in Tapestry the shapes of Tygers, Lyons, and
other Beasts, and painting on the Walls of their Houses variety of
Figures of divers colours, covering their Floors with Mats neatly
pleited of Rushes. They fed on Fish, Venison, and Mans-flesh, and also
on the Roots _Agies_, tasting like Chesnuts, _Yuca_, _Maiz_, _Batata_,
and _Cassada_.

[Sidenote: Chief Cities and Places of note.]

The chief Cities and Places of principal note in this Province are 1.
_St. Martha_, which gives Denomination to the whole Province, it stands
built at the North Sea, which makes a large and convenient Harbor, being
defended from the Winds by high Mountains and two Isles, is a Bishop’s
See, and hath a large Cathedral. The Houses built of Canes are cover’d
with _Palmito_-Trees, and some with woodden Shingles. The Haven hath
neither Fort nor Castle to defend it, because there is no Trade but with
the _Indians_, which bring Earthen Ware and Cotton Clothes to sell; and
because the _Spanish_ Ships seldom come hither, the Place is much gone
to decay, and the more, because it is no way defended against any
Assault of an Enemy, which the _French_, and afterwards the _English_,
under the Command of Sir _Francis Drake_, and the following Year under
Captain _Anthony Shirley_ took advantage of, and plunder’d and burnt the
City.

2. _Teneriff_, built on the Banks of the River _Magdalena_, forty
Leagues from _St. Martha_.

3. _Tamalameque_, otherwise call’d _Villa de las Palmas_, twenty Leagues
South of _Teneriff_, lying on a high stony Ground; between which are
plain Pastures for Cattel, surrounded with high Woods, as also Pools
made by the over-flowing of the Rivers, whose Banks are inhabited by the
_Indians_, who are much addicted to Sleep and Drinking. The Pools before
mention’d produce abundance of Fish, as also Crocodiles, and the
terrible _Manati_ before describ’d.

4. _Ocanna_, which hath an Inland Haven.

5. _Ramada_, formerly call’d _New Salamanca_, standing at the Foot of
the Mountain call’d _Sierras Nevadas_. This Town is famous for its
Copper and Brass Mines.

6. _Cividad de los Reyes_, which built in the Valley _Upari_, stands on
the Shore of the mighty River _Guataporeya_, where from the beginning of
_January_ till _May_ the Eastern Breezes moderate the Heat, otherwise
intolerable: But the continual Rains thereabout occasions the _Quartan_
Ague, and many such like Distempers. The Natives hereabouts, salvage and
valiant, would never submit to the _Spaniards_.

[Sidenote: The Tree _Xagua_.]

The peculiar Plants of this Place are the Tree _Xagua_, which bears a
Fruit like a Raisin, which dry’d and ground yields exceeding good Meal
for Bread.

[Sidenote: The Root _Scorzonera_.]

The Root _Scorzonera_, which cures the Bitings of Serpents. The
_Indians_ also use the Tail of a Serpent for a Remedy against the same
Evil, as they take Tobacco against the Falling-sickness, and snuff the
Powder in at their Nostrils, and drink the Juice thereof to cause
Loosness.

[Sidenote: Chief Rivers.]

The chief Rivers of this Province, are 1. _Polomino_, so call’d from a
_Spanish_ Captain, that was drown’d there with his Horse, falling from
the _Sierras Nevadas_.

2. _Guatupori_, whose Water causes the Bloody-flux and Loosness, which
again is cur’d by the same Water drunk with beaten Cinamon. _Guatupori_
reckons many Rivulets, amongst which the _Cesar_ and _Budillo_ are both
large, deep, and abounding with Fish.

Near the City _Los Reyes_ are three great Water-pits, triangular between
stony Cliffs; nigh which a Tradition goes, That of old there lurk’d a
terrible Serpent, which at times devour’d a thousand People; insomuch
that none durst dwell thereabouts, till certain _Spaniards_ having the
hardiness and curiosity to go seek out this Serpent, heard a great noise
in the Pits, but saw nothing like the fore-mention’d Animal.

Here are likewise several Fountains of Pitch and Tar.


                               SECT. VI.
                            Rio de la Hacha.

[Sidenote: _Rio de la Hacha._]

_Rio de la Hacha_ is the Name of a little Province lying on the
North-East of _St. Martha_, wash’d on all other parts with the Waters of
the Main Ocean, or with the Gulf or Bay of _Venezuela_.

[Sidenote: Chief Towns of this Province.]

The chief Towns of this Province, are 1. A small Town call’d _De la
Hacha_, which gives Denomination to the said Province, having no
convenient Haven, but otherwise seated in a Soil very rich and fertile,
not onely of all sorts of Fruits and Plants, especially such as are
brought from _Spain_, but likewise in many Mines of Gold, Gems of a
large size and great value, and many excellent Salt-Wiches, as they call
them; It is eight Leagues distant from _Salamanca_ aforesaid, and
eighteen from _Cape Villa_, the most Westerly Point or Foreland of the
Bay of _Venezuela_; and with the rest had the hap to be surpris’d and
pillag’d by the _English_ with Sir _Francis Drake_ in the Year 1595. who
refus’d twenty four thousand _Ducats_, which the Governor proffer’d him
for the Pearls he had taken.

2. _Rancheria_, six Leagues Eastward of _La Hacha_, inhabited chiefly by
Pearl-Fishers, or such as get their Living for the most part by Fishing
for Pearl, which was wont to be good on these Coasts.

3. _Tapia_, five Leagues from _La Hacha_, and considerable, for that the
adjacent Parts were laid waste by the _English_, to revenge the
perfidiousness of the Governor of _Salamanca_, refusing to pay the four
thousand _Ducats_ he had promis’d, upon Condition of their sparing the
Town.

[Sidenote: _Abibeca_ the last King of this Province.]

The last King of those that Govern’d in any of these Provinces of _Terra
Firma_, was _Abibeca_, who could not be won to come down from his
Palace, which he had on the top of a Tree, till a _Spanish_ Officer, one
_Francisco de Vanquez_ began to lay an Ax to the Root thereof.

After _Didaco Niquesa_, _Alphonso Oreda_, and _Anciso_, had made very
large Discoveries in these Provinces, _Valboa_ was the first that
discover’d the Way to the South-Sea.

                              New Granada.


[Sidenote: First Discovery of _New Granada_.]

The new Kingdom of _Granada_, as ’tis commonly call’d, was for the most
part both discover’d and conquer’d by _Gonsalvo Ximenes_, about the Year
1536. and with so good success, that in less than a years space, the
whole Countrey was quietly setled under the _Spaniards_ Government, and
the Captain with his small Company had made shift to gather together
such a Mass of Treasure as may seem almost incredible, _viz._ from the
_Reguli_, or petty Princes of those Countreys, whom he had either
destroy’d or made Tributary. But a more particular Relation of _Ximenes_
his Journey take as followeth:

[Sidenote: _Gustavo Ximenes_ his Expedition.]

Being sent out by _Peter Ferdinando de Lugo_, to discover the Countreys
that lay along the River _Magdalena_, he travell’d upon the right side
of it with great trouble; for not onely the brambly Woods, Moors, and
deep Brooks, made the Way exceeding bad to be travell’d, but also the
Inhabitants, who fell upon him from their Ambuscades: yet at last he
reach’d _Tora_, which Name he chang’d into _Pueblo de los Bracos_,
because four Rivers unite their Waters there. Here ordering his
Brigantines which were come up the River to cast their Anchors, he
judg’d it convenient to stay all the Winter, because the swoln Rivers
had drown’d the adjacent Countrey. _Ximenes_ observing that the
_Indians_ fetch’d Salt from the Sea-side, judg’d that the Countrey was
inhabited, and therefore in fair Weather march’d up to the Mountain
_Opou_, behind which he found a Countrey full of Salt-pools, which
produc’d Cakes of Salt. And somewhat farther the Province Govern’d by
the Casique _Bogata_, who at first resisting the _Spaniards_, was soon
put to flight, when he heard the noise of the Guns. The _Panches_
divided from _Bogata_’s Countrey by a small Mountain, also maintaining
continual Wars with him, suffer’d the _Spaniards_ unmolested to travel
through their Countrey, and the Valley _La Trompetta_, to a high barren
Mountain, on the top of which _Ximenes_ found several Emeraulds; and
going from thence fell upon the Casique _Tunia_, and three days Journey
farther, upon the Governors _Sagamosa_ and _Diutama_; from which three
Countreys he carried above a hundred and ninety thousand pieces of fine
Gold, fifty five thousand pieces of indifferent Gold, and eighteen
hundred Emeraulds; all which the _Spaniards_ left behind with Guards
whilest they went back to _Bogata_ whom they found lying dead of his
Wounds on a high Hill: But _Sagipa_, _Bogata_’s Successor, receiv’d
_Ximenes_ with great Civility, to engage his Assistance against his
Neighbors the _Panches_; which he did not refuse him: but afterwards he
fell most perfidiously upon the said _Sagipa_, whom he caus’d to be
Executed, because he either could not, or would not discover where those
Riches were which _Bogata_ had left behind him. After he had pillag’d
the little Region _Neyba_, and brought into subjection the whole
Countrey, he gave it the Name of _New Granada_, from _Granada_ the place
of his Nativity, being the chief City of the Kingdom of _Granada_ in
_Spain_, and built the City _Santa Fe_; which done, he quitted the
Place, upon information that _Sebastian de Bevalcazar_ coming from
_Popayan_, was seeking a Way Northward; and not long after him _Nicholas
Federman_ follow’d, each claiming _New Granada_ as their Right, whereas
_Ximenes_ alledg’d, That the first Discovery thereof was to be ascribed
to him onely: at last Agreeing, they resolv’d that it should be at the
King of _Spain_’s disposal.

[Sidenote: The Nature and Custom of the _Moxas_.]

The antient Inhabitants, nam’d _Moxas_, divided their Countrey into two
chief Principalities, _viz._ _Bogota_ and _Tunica_, which before the
_Spaniards_ Arrival were each under their particular _Casique_ or
Prince. The Men were of a good proportion; the Women also handsomer, and
of a fairer Complexion than their Neighbors: Their Habit also consisted
of black, white, and divers colour’d Cotton Cloaks, and some also had
Bonnets of the same. The temperateness of the Climate makes little
difference between Winter and Summer. Their Houses were of Planks, and
cover’d with long Rushes. Their chiefest Food was _Maiz_ and _Cassave_,
which first grows on Stalks as large as Canes, containing very large and
weighty Spikes or Ears, each Ear generally yielding seven hundred
Grains, which are Planted in hot and moist Ground; one Bushel Sow’n,
generally produces three hundred. But the _Maiz_ is distinguish’d into a
courser or finer sort, which last is call’d _Moroche_, the Leaves and
Canes whereof afford a wholsom Provender for Horses, and the Corn, Bread
for the Inhabitants, who make it several ways; for sometimes they boyl
it in Water, and at other times parch it in Ashes, or grind it to Meal,
which kneading into Dough, they make into Cakes, Biskets, and the like:
Moreover, _Maiz_ steep’d in Water, and after being boyl’d and set a
working, makes a very strong Liquor. They also use _Cassada_, which they
make of the Root _Yuca_, which being large and thick, is cut in pieces,
grated, and all its Juice, which is deadly poyson, being press’d out, is
Bak’d in thin Cakes. There is likewise another sort of _Yuca_, which
hath not so poysonous a Juice, keeping good a long time, and is both
wholsom, and of a good taste. The Natives of old liv’d much upon the
Roots _Yomus_, and _Cubias_, all sorts of Venison, Fowls, and Fish,
which the Rivers and Lakes afford in great abundance. Those that are
left of the Natives, are a deceitful, crafty, and ingenious sort of
People, very apt to learn Art, and to Trade with Salt to _Rio Grande_,
and the Mountain _Opou_.

Besides Copper and Steel-Mines, this Countrey hath also several of Gold;
and the Fields produce all manner of Plants.

[Sidenote: The Nature of the _Panchas_.]

The _Panchas_ which remain are yet a salvage People, but their Countrey
is an indifferent fertile Soil, though not in all places alike; for
those which border upon _Tunia_ fed much heretofore on Pismires, of
which some being long, have double Wings, others lesser and without
Wings; which last sort being roasted, are accounted a great Dainty, and
a speedy Remedy against the Distemper of the Gravel. There are also a
sort of venomous Pismires, which stinging a Man, cause a swelling and
great itching, and these are call’d _Tayoques_, whose Stings are cur’d
by a Plaister of bruis’d Pismires.

[Sidenote: The Bounds and Dimensions of _Nova Granada_.]

The Countrey is bounded on the North with _Castella Aurea_ aforesaid; on
the West, with _Mare del Zur_; on the East, with _Venezuela_; the
Southern parts of it being not well discover’d, by reason of certain
huge and unpassable Mountains, which block it up wholly on that side,
save onely where a Passage is kept open into the Province of _Peru_,
specially so call’d: It containeth in length about a hundred and thirty
Leagues, and not much less in breadth, being for the most part a very
healthful Countrey, and abounding in Mines of the best sort of Metal,
besides others of Brass and Iron. It is subdivided into these two
Provinces, _viz._ _Granada_ and _Popayana_.


                               SECT. II.
                                Granada.

[Sidenote: Description of _Granada_.]

_Granada_, specially so call’d, is a Countrey of a very temperate and
good Air, as hath been before observ’d, neither subject to over-much
Cold, nor to extremity of Heat; which is the more to be admir’d by
reason of its nearness to the _Line_, from which it is distant Northward
but a very few Degrees.

[Sidenote: Towns of chief note.]

The Towns and Places of chief importance are, 1. _St. Foy_, commonly
call’d _St. Foy de Bagota_, which was the old Name of this Province, and
to distinguish it from another _St. Foy_, in the Countrey of _New
Mexico_ above mention’d. It is the Metropolis and Capital City of this
Province, an Arch-bishop’s See, and the ordinary Residence of the
Governor, built by the above-mention’d _Gonsalvo Ximenes_ upon the Lake
call’d _Guatavita_, and hath been long since inhabited by above six
hundred Families of _Spaniards_.

2. _St. Michael_, twelve Leagues Northward of _St. Foy_, and a well
Traded Town. The _Indians_ that dwell about this Place being above five
thousand, pay great Tribute yearly. Not far from hence lies the Lake
_Guatavita_, where the Inhabitants in former times Offer’d much Gold to
their Idols.

[Sidenote: Commodities of the Countrey of _Tocaima_.]

3. _Tocaima_, fourteen Leagues Westward from _St. Foy_, within a
Territory which antiently belong’d to the _Panches_, who yet possess the
worst part of it, lying still wild and unreduc’d: It is situate on the
Banks of the great River _Pati_, which falls into the Rivulet
_Magdalena_. This City, which enjoys the benefit of a wholsom Climate,
is surrounded with Mines of Gold, Copper, Silver, and Lead. And besides
the Fruits of the Countrey, all _Spanish_ Plants thrive exceedingly
after once Planted; and though Sheep will not breed here, yet Kine,
Hogs, and Goats increase daily, but are often devour’d by Tygers, Lyons,
and Bears. The Woods produce Nut-Trees, Cedars, _Guaiacum_, or
_Pock-Wood_, and the wonderful Tree _Zeyba_, whose Leaves fall off every
twelve hours, and grow again. The Fowls of this Countrey are many and
several. Near the City are sulphurous Fountains, whose Waters cure Scabs
and Leprosie. In the Valleys also flow Springs of salt Water, which
thrown on Herbs, turns to Rozen and Pitch, and is good to make Boats
tight. The tops of the Mountains are continually cover’d with Snow,
notwithstanding some of them vomit forth horrible Flames and Ashes,
which are blown several Leagues over the Countrey. The vicissitude of
the Weather occasions two Summers and two Winters; the first Summer
begins in _December_, and the second in _June_; the first Winter
accordingly begins in _March_, and the other in _October_. This
alteration of Seasons is not distinguish’d by any change of Heat or
Cold, but the continuance of fair Weather during the Summer, and in the
Winter, of such terrible Hurricanes, that blow from North to South, or
from South to North, with such Thundering and Lightning, as if the end
of the World were at hand. The chiefest Trees that grow here are Cedars,
and one that bears exceeding great Almonds. The _Quaque_ also bears a
pleasant Fruit about the bigness of a Goose-Egg; and the Fig-Tree, Figs
as large as Oranges. The _Agnapa_ which grows here is of such a nature,
that an _European_ sleeping under it, swells exceedingly, but an
_Indian_ bursts. The Bark and Sprigs of the _Hobo_, which grows high and
round, serve against Swellings and Ulcers, and occasion also Loosness.
Sugar-Canes grow also here in great abundance, amongst which feed
certain Beasts like Hogs, whose Navels grow on their Backs; and large
Stags. The Fountains in most places of this Countrey run with salt
Water; and sometimes Salt is found between fresh-Water Brooks. The
Natives, who are valiant, subtile, and well proportion’d, are since
their giving over eating of Mans-flesh much increas’d, and many of them
forsaking their Heathenish Idolatry, have embrac’d the _Roman-Catholick_
Religion.

4. _La Palma_, built _Anno 1572._ in a certain Territory, the People
whereof were antiently call’d _Musi_ and _Colymæ_.

5. _Trinidad_, which is indeed the antient _Tudela_ renew’d, or a City
sprung out of the Ruines thereof. This _Tudela_ stood on the Shore of
the River _Zarbi_, which running between high Mountains, makes the
Rivulet _Turatena_, and in the same Territory as _La Palma_ above
mention’d, _viz._ of the _Musi_ & _Colymæ_, by whom the _Spaniards_, who
had here a Colony, were so exceedingly molested, that they deserted the
same, together with their Governor _Peter de Orsua_: yet not long after
the forsaken Place was again re-built by the Name of _Trinidad_; but
that Place proving incommodious, was again abandon’d, and a new
_Trinidad_ built, where now it is to be seen on a convenient place
Eastward from the high and cold Mountain _Paramo_. From several rich
Gemmaries thereabouts are digg’d store of Emeraulds, Crystal like
Diamonds, white Marble, and the Beryl, especially on the Mountains
_Ytoco_ and _Abipi_.

6. _Tunia_, having a Territory about it, to which it gives Denomination;
It lies on a high Hill, from whence the Church and two Cloysters of the
_Dominican_ Fryers are seen at a great distance. Here also is kept the
greatest Market in _New Granada_.

7. _Pampelona_, sixty Leagues distant from _St. Foy_ to the North-East,
abounding with Cattel and Gold.

8. _Merida_, surrounded with Corn-Fields, the farthest Town of this
Province North-Eastward towards _Venezuela_.

9. _Belez_, which though it suffers great prejudice by a burning a
Mountain that vomits Fire and Stones, and also Thunder and Lightning, is
the greatest Residence of several Orders of Fryers.

10. _Marequita_, otherwise call’d _St. Sebastian del Oro_, which lies
under a hot Climate, and hath much Pasture.

11. _Ybague_, the Habitation chiefly of _Dominicans_.

12. _La Vittoria de los Remedios_; and 13. _Juan de los Lanos_, or _St.
John of the Plains_, seated in a rich Nook of the Countrey, where there
are good Silver and Gold-Mines.

The Merchandise that come to these Towns, are brought up the River
_Magdalena_ in _Canoos_ of sixty Foot long.

                               Popayana.

[Sidenote: Situation and Description of _Popayana_.]

_Popayana_, the other part of this new Kingdom, is border’d on the West
with part of _Granada_ last spoken of, from which the River _St. Martha_
divides it for the most part: On the North it hath _Nova Andaluzia_, or
_Carthagena_; on the West, _Mare del Zur_; and on the South, _Quito_, or
rather some unreduc’d Countreys lying betwixt them both; It extends in
length above a hundred Leagues from North to South, but in breadth,
betwixt the River and the South Sea, not much above forty or fifty. The
Countrey is said to be a little too much subject to Rain, yet not so,
but that the fertility of the Soil answers the industry of the
Inhabitants in most places very well.

_Sebastian de Bevalcazar_, Governor of _Quito_, marching _Anno 1536._
with a Company of _Spaniards_ to _Otabalo_, where the Countrey _Popayan_
begins, was often set upon by the Natives from their Ambuscades, and the
many Inconveniences which he suffer’d for want of Provisions, and
trouble of travelling over the high Mountains, had necessitated him to
return, had he not been resolutely bent to discover the Countrey; to
which purpose marching on leisurely, he came into the heart of
_Popayan_, where his wearied People sufficiently resting themselves
amidst a fruitful Countrey, where they found pleasant Fruit-Trees,
Houses full of Provisions, and fresh Rivers, which glided from the
Mountain _Andes_, and some of the Rivulets also affording Gold, were
encourag’d to build several Villages; in which nevertheless they made no
Settlement, either because they could not get Gold enough, or else being
driven from thence by the valiant Natives.

[Sidenote: Cities and Towns of chief note.]

The Places of chief note in it, are 1. _Popayan_, situate on the Banks
of a fair River, but not nam’d, and in the midst of a Plain in a place
of great Wealth, and enjoying a good Air. The original of the Name
_Popayan_ is from the _Casique_ who Govern’d there at the time of the
_Spaniards_ first Arrival. It is a Bishop’s See, and the ordinary
Residence of the Governor of the Province. The chief Buildings are the
Cathedral, and a Monastery of the Fryers _De la Merced_. The _Savanna_
Grounds towards the North feed many fat Cattel. The Fields produce the
best _American Maiz_. Some of the adjacent Mountains either vomit Smoak,
Flames, great Stones, or scalding Water, leaving a Salt behind it.
Beyond the City _Popayan_ the great River _Magdalena_ takes its original
in the Valley _Cali_, where several Brooks gliding from the Mountain
_Andes_, inhabited by the _Cocunocos_, unite their Waters.

2. _Antiochia_, otherwise call’d _St. Fides de Antiochia_, on the
Borders of _New Andaluzia_, and about a hundred Leagues from _Popayan_.
In the midst of a small Territory to which it gives Name, in the Valley
_Nore_, between the River _Magdalena_ and _Daria_, wash’d by Rivulets,
whose Sands are Golden, and whose Banks are shaded with all sorts of
Fruit-Trees. The Inhabitants white and very rational, sleep in the Night
under the open Skye: Their Houses are built a good distance from the
Highways; near which the Pastures feed abundance of Sheep. The Pools
breed plenty of Fish, and the Mines store of Gold, especially in the
Mountain _Buritica_.

3. _Caramanta_, seated likewise on the Banks of the River _St. Martha_,
within a little Province also of the same Name; the Inhabitants whereof
being valiant and strong go naked, and dwell in little Huts, make white
Salt out of a Fountain and a little Lake: they generally go to
_Antiochia_ in six hours, which is forty five Leagues, so swift runs the
Stream.

4. _St. Anne_, in the _Cantred_ or Hundred of _Anzerma_, a Town neatly
situate upon the side of an Hill betwixt two Rivers, and in the midst of
Plain no less pleasant than fertile: It was so call’d by _Bevalcazar_,
because the _Indians_ of this Place name the Salt _Anzer_; it is
surrounded with Villages and Woods on a high Plain between two Rivers.
The Air being exceeding hot, lightens generally every day.

5. The Village _Pueblo Llana_, which is inhabited by little People, who
Trade in Salt, and have also Golden Rivulets. Near this Place is the
Valley _Aburra_, consisting of many fruitful Plains, moistned by several
Rivers; the Inhabitants whereof at the _Spaniards_ first coming thither,
hang’d themselves, with their Wives and Children.

6. _St. Jago de Arma_, built in a Wood of Palm-Trees, so nam’d from the
Territory in which it standeth, rich and famous for its Mines of Gold,
which it is said to have many and very good: The Ground round about
being Mountainous, hath several Rivers, the chiefest whereof call’d _Di
Arma_, is dangerous to cross, especially in Winter. The unwholsom Air
hereabouts occasions many Sicknesses. Amongst other Fruits that grow in
this County, is the _Pytahaya_, which whoe’re eats, voids Urine as red
as Blood. Adjacent to it are the little Provinces _Paucuran_, _Pozo_,
and _Picara_, which possess Golden Mines: also the Territory _Carrapa_
which hath high and rugged Land, and many Rivulets: likewise the County
_Quimbaya_, which abounds with thick and long Canes, wherewith the
Natives build their Houses; in the hollow Bodies of these Canes the wild
Bees gather store of Honey; and amongst them breed also exceeding great
Lyons, the four-footed Beast _Chuca_ which carries its Young in a Bag,
Stags, Rabbets and _Guadaquinajes_, which being bigger than Hares, are
exceeding good Meat. The Mountain _Nevada_, wonderful high, and smoaking
continually, produces the golden Rivers _Tacurumbi_ & _De la Cequo_.
Twenty Leagues or more distant from _St. Jago_ is, 7. _Carthago_, the
chief City of _Quimbayaes_, and by which the aforesaid Rivers run. The
temperate Climate here gives Health and long Life to the Inhabitants,
who have several Fountains of salt Water, and the Fruit _Caymito_, not
unlike a Peach, black within, having little Kernels, and a Juice which
Dyes so deep, that it can scarce be wash’d off. Horses and Cows they
have likewise very plentiful. _Carthago_ it self stands in a pleasant
Plain between two Rivulets; the Ways that lead to the same are very
dirty, because of the continual Rain which falls there, with Lightning
and Thunder. A League beyond the City flows the Stream _Consota_; near
which lies a Lake, out of which Salt is made.

8. The City _Cali_, the Residence for the Governor and Collector, lying
under a hot Climate in a plain Valley at a River, which falling from the
Mountain, glides to the Stream _Magdalena_. Round about the same dwelt
antiently several People, _viz._ the _Gorrones_, so call’d, because they
nam’d a Fish _Gorron_, the _Chancos_, Giants, with long Faces and broad
Foreheads, the _Aarbacoas_, _Agnales_, and _Los Timbas_, inhabiting
among barren Mountains; but most of them were slain by the _Spaniards_,
or destroy’d by one another, few onely escaping to the tops of the
Mountains. The Countrey also swarms with wild Beasts, which have also
devour’d many of the Inhabitants, both _Indians_ and _Spaniards_.

9. The Haven _Bonaventure_, situate in a deep Inlet, about which live
some Families which send the Commodities that come from _New Spain_ to
_Popayan_, _Cali_, and other Places; and though there be a Way along by
the River _Dagua_, convenient for Mules and Horses to travel, yet it is
seldom us’d, because the Cattel are so wearied out with the long
Journey, that they cannot go through with their Loads; wherefore they
employ the _Indians_ to carry their heavy Burthens over the Mountains,
which they do for a small Reward.

10. _St. Juan de Pasto_, giving Denomination to the Countrey about it,
and being built on the pleasant Plains of the Valley _Atris_, is situate
in a wholsom Climate, and is moistned by several Fountains and the River
_Angasmayo_, the Boundary of _Peru_. The _Spaniards_ have several Houses
here, and breed store of Cattel, and especially Hogs. They have likewise
Sugar-Mills, with which they make abundance of Sugar. The antient
Inhabitants were salvage, deform’d, and of little Reason.

11. _Timana_, giving Denomination to the Countrey about, is plac’d under
a hot Climate, yet the Inhabitants live long; they drive a great Trade
with Thred spun out of the Herb _Pita_; and also with Sweet-meats,
Fruits Preserv’d with Honey and Sugar, and especially a Kernel not
unlike an Almond. In their Gardens they Plant the Herb _Cocoa_, which
they chew constantly for the strengthning of their Hearts. Near _Pita_
is a Mountain with Load-stones; and somewhat farther the Habitations of
the valiant _Yalcones_ in the Valley _Aquirya_, the _Paezes_, _Pixaos_,
and _Manipos_, which so molested the _Spaniards_, that they forc’d them
to forsake the Towns _Neyra_, _St. Vincent_, and _Ville de los Angelos_.

12. _Guadalajara de Buga_; and 13. _Sebastian de la Plata_, built on a
Plain near the River _Guali_; the Countrey about which is exceedingly
troubled with Earthquakes, and the Inhabitants with their Neighbors the
_Nineres_, who bring the Flesh of their Prisoners to Sale in the publick
Shambles.

14. _Almague_, built on a high Mountain, and lying under a cool Climate,
is surrounded with fruitful Fields, which feed store of Cattel, and
enrich’d with several Gold-Mines.

15. _Juan de Truxillo_, which the _Indians_ call _Yscance_.

16. _Madrigall_; 17. _Chapanchipa_; 18. _Malaga_; and 19. _Agreda_; the
Mountains about which inclose store of Gold.

Between the Promontory _De Corrientes_ and the Island _Palmas_, are the
Rivers _Salinas_ and _Balsas_, which fall into the Southern Ocean; _St.
Juan_, whose Banks are inhabited by a salvage People which dwell in the
tops of the Trees, because the River oftentimes overflows the Countrey.
They sowe Pease and Beans, and catch Fish, but buy other Provisions,
with Gold.

[Sidenote: The Isle _Gorgona_.]

Against the Mouth of this River _St. Juan_ lies the Isle _Gorgona_,
three Leagues in circumference, which is compar’d to Hell, because of
the dismal Woods which are upon it, barren Mountains, Millions of
_Musticho_’s, whose Stings are intolerable, and never-ceasing Rain,
insomuch that the Sun never shines upon it.

[Sidenote: The Isle _Del Gallo_.]

West-South-West from _Gorgona_ lies the round Island _Del Gallo_, about
a League in circumference; it is divided by several Rivers, and round
about Planted with Trees, on which the _Indians_ dwell as at the River
_St. Juan_.

                                 Peru.


[Sidenote: The Description and Division of _Peru_.]

_Peru_, so call’d, as some think, from the River _Beru_ afore mention’d,
in the Southern part of _America_, was antiently a great and mighty
Kingdom, as _Mexico_ in the Northern, and fell under the Power of the
_Spaniards_ much after the same manner that the Kingdom of _Mexico_ did,
_viz._ through the Dissentions and Differences amongst the People
themselves, as in the History of this considerable part of the _New
World_ will be related at large hereafter.

[Illustration: PERV]

[Sidenote: Commodities of the Countrey.]

[Sidenote: The Fountain _Puchio_.]

[Sidenote: Another strange Fountain.]

[Sidenote: A most wonderful Rock.]

The Kingdom of the Kings of _Cusco_, which in some sence, and by some
Writers upon occasion, is call’d _The Kingdom of Peru_, was extended by
the last _Inca_ or King, _Huayna Capac_, from North to South above a
thousand Leagues together, comprehending not only a great part of the
Province of _Chile_ towards the South, but also the new Kingdom of
_Granada_, and divers other Provinces to the North; but _Peru_, properly
so call’d, containeth little more than half so much, _viz._ six hundred
Leagues in length, and about fifty or threescore in breadth, except
onely in some places, as in the Countrey of _Chacopoyas_, where ’tis
thought it may be a hundred Leagues from the _Andes_ to the South Sea:
It lieth between the first and fifth Degrees of Southern Latitude, and
is bounded on the East and North-East with that vast Ridge of Mountains
which they call the _Andes_; on the West it is wash’d with _Mare del
Zur_; on the North it hath the Countrey of _Popayan_; and on the South,
_Chile_: It is commonly divided into three parts, which they call _The
Plains_, _The Hill-Countrey_, and _The Andes_; the _Plains_ are that
part of the Countrey which lie along upon the Sea-Coast, being for the
most part a meer Level without any Hills at all. The _Sierra_, as they
call it, or _Hill-Countrey_, is that part of _Peru_ which is partly
mountainous and partly plain, fertile and well inhabited in both. The
_Andes_ are so high, rocky, and inaccessible, that they are scarce
inhabited at all but by Salvages, save onely upon the skirts of them.
The _Plains_ from the Sea-shore to the _Hill-Countrey_, are for the most
part about ten Leagues over or broad, upon which it scarce raineth all
the year long. The _Hill-Countrey_ is commonly twenty Leagues in breadth
where narrowest; and from _September_ to _April_ hath Rain, the rest of
the Year generally being fair Weather; but on the _Andes_, which take up
all the rest of the Countrey of _Peru_, it raineth almost continually
all the year long. In the _Hill-Countrey_ their Summer begins in
_April_, as is said, and ends in _September_; but in the _Plains_ it
begins in _October_, and ends in _May_; so that in the space of a day a
Man may feel both Summer and Winter; be scorch’d with excessive Heat in
the Morning, and yet well nipt with Cold before Night. The _Andes_
generally are cover’d with thick Woods and wild Forrests. The
_Hill-Countrey_ is for a great space naked and open; the _Plains_ in
many places sandy and dry, and would be much more scorch’d with Heat
than they are, but for the neighborhood of the Sea, which affords them
many cooling Gales from the South and South-West Winds, whose property,
although it be natural in other parts to be tempestuous, to bring Rain
and foul Weather, yet here there is nothing but Serenity and fair
Sun-shine days all the year long, although these Winds blow almost
without ceasing upon the Countrey, and no other at any time, whereas the
_Sierra_, or _Hill-Countreys_ have Wind from every Coast, and such as
bringeth all sorts of Weather with it, Rain, Hail, Frost, Snow, great
claps of Thunder, _&c._ The Countrey affordeth not so much Cattel of the
breed of _Europe_ as some other Provinces of _America_; but in stead of
Kine and Sheep, the Woods and Pastures are replenish’d with multitudes
of the _Vicugnes_ and _Pacos_, which are of no less Profit and Service.
The _Pacos_ here are said to be as big as some young Heifers of two
years old, bearing a Fleece like Sheep, and their Flesh no less pleasant
than the Mutton of _Europe_. But the great Wealth of this Countrey lies
out of sight in the bowels of the Earth, _viz._ in those rich and (as
they may seem) inexhaustible Mines both of Gold and Silver, which, as
’tis well known, the Countrey of _Peru_ affordeth more than any other
Province of _America_ besides. The _Sierra_ opens into large Valleys,
amongst the chiefest whereof are _Xauxa_, _Andaguailas_, and _Yucay_,
all of them well inhabited and fruitful. Below _Cusco_ the Mountains
_Andes_ and those of _Sierra_ run a greater distance than elsewhere one
from the other, leaving the great Plain _Callao_ in the middle.
Moreover, several sandy Wilds, without Water, Herbs, Trees, or any
living Creature, except Birds, extend from _Tumbez_ to _Taparaca_. From
the Valleys flow several Rivers into the Southern Ocean. On the Mountain
_Pira_ is a Fountain call’d _Puchio_, which springs in the Night, but is
quite dry in the Day-time. Also near the chief City _Quito_ in the
Valley _Chilo_, is a Fountain whose Waters boyl faster or slower
according as any one speaks softer or louder; and when not a word is
spoken, it stirs not at all. If any thing exceed this for strangeness,
it is a Rock in the Province _Concuchos_, which is all compos’d of black
and white Stones, which are so neatly plac’d by Nature, as if Art had
done a Master-piece, in the exact placing of them one between another:
but the chiefest thing belonging to it worthy of admiration, is a
wonderful power either to heal or hurt; for if the black Stones in this
Rock be touch’d by any, they cause immediate Death; whenas the white
ones cure all manner of Sicknesses, and being digg’d out, leave a Seed
behind them, out of which grow new Stones to fill up the empty place.

[Illustration]

_Iuca Garcilasso_, Extracted from the _Peruvian_ Kings, tells us
concerning Plants, That he saw a Raddish which a Man with both Arms
could scarce embrace, and that under the shade of their Leaves, Horses
might stand. But of all the _Peruan_ Fruit the _Cocoa_ is the crown,
which grows on Trees of a Fathom long in hot and moist Grounds of the
Valleys between _Andes_ and _Sierra_; from whence it is carried to the
Sea-Coast in long Baskets by Companies of three or four thousand at a
time on the Backs of the Sheep _Pacos_. Before the _Spaniards_ coming
hither none might chew _Cocoa_ without the Governor’s leave: A handful
thereof chew’d and suck’d in the Mouth, enables a Man to travel two days
without any other Sustenance, and mix’d with burnt Bones or Chalk, it is
accounted an excellent Dish; there is such extraordinary plenty of them,
that the Inhabitants spend yearly 90000 Baskets of the Leaves in
Pottage. The _Peruans_ also esteem _Mamayes_, a Fruit which grows round,
not unlike a Peach, with two Stones, hard Rinds, and a well-rellish’d
Pulp within, which dipt in Sugar is a great Dainty; they grow for the
most part in the Islands. The _Guaiyavas_ bears a wholsom and delicious
Fruit like a large Plumb. The _Palto_, a Tree with many Boughs, bears a
Fruit resembling a Pear, having a hard Rind, and within the Pulp a great
Stone. The Fruit which grows on the _Annona_ hath outwardly the same
shape, but white within, and hath many black Kernels, which taste very
deliciously. The Fruit _Andas_, so call’d from the desolate _Peruan_
Mountains on which they grow, resemble the fore-mention’d _Cocoa_, but
differ from the _East-Indian_, because they are full of hard shell’d
Almonds, the like whereof grows on the Tree _Cachapoyas_, which are not
inferior to any _European_ Fruits that grow on Trees; in that part of
_Peru_ which hath its Name from that Fruit is the best sort, being
exceedingly devour’d by Monkies, who plucking the _Cachapoya_ Almonds
from their Stalks, throw them on the Ground to break their prickly
Shells, that so they may eat the Kernels without hurt. The _Mille_-Tree,
being a sort of Grapes, furnishes with Wine. But the greatest benefit
the Inhabitants receive is by their Sheep _Pacos_ and _Moromoros_, which
carry great Loads, and feed on what they find by the Way; their Flesh is
good and wholsom, and being either Smoak’d or Salted, keeps good a
considerable time; their Wool dress’d affords _Cumbi_, of which they
make fine Table-clothes and Tapestry, which on both sides is alike. The
chiefest Weavers liv’d formerly at _Copachica_ near the great Lake
_Titicacu_: They Dye their Wool with the Juice of boyl’d Herbs. It seems
also strange to consider what Loads the foremention’d Sheep carried, for
besides all sorts of Merchandise, they convey’d the Silver from _Potosi_
to _Arica_, a Way of sixty three Leagues; but in former times they
brought it as far again to _Arequipa_; and though they carried two
thousand Bars at a time, amounting to above thirty thousand _Ducats_,
yet they had no other Guard but a few Herdsmen, who driving them slept
with them in the Nights under the bare Skie, yet lost none of their
Riches, but when the bald Sheep call’d _Moromoros_, being wearied with
their Loads, standing still, stretch’d out their Necks, and looking on
their Drivers, on a sudden ran up into the Mountains, by which means the
Silver was oft-times lost, if they were not suddenly shot. The woolly
Sheep _Pacos_ have also strange Tricks, for they often fall down under
their Loads, and cannot be got up again, but must be let alone till they
rise of themselves. So soon as one of the Sheep hath gotten the Mange
(which the _Peruvians_ call _T’ecarache_,) they bury them alive to
prevent farther Infection.

[Sidenote: The Customs and Habits of the antient Natives.]

[Sidenote: Giants antiently in _St. Helena_.]

The antient Natives, though differing in Language and Customs, yet went
all Apparell’d after the same fashion, the Men cover’d themselves with a
Shirt, which came down below their Knees, and over that a Cotton Cloak,
the Women wore woollen Coats down to their Ancles: Their Head-Ornaments
were different according to an inviolable Compact between the Natives of
several Provinces; for some were wrought, some plain, some divers
colour’d Caps, with two, three, or no Feathers, according to the Custom
of the Place: They were generally of a middle Stature; but those that
were near the _Equinoctial Line_ lesser. Their Histories make mention
also of Gyants, who formerly inhabited the Promontory _St. Helena_, were
each four times bigger than an ordinary Man, and fed not onely on the
greatest Sea-Monsters, but devour’d each of them thirty _Peruvians_ at a
Meal. The Stone Images of these Gyants are at this day to be seen not
far from _Puerto Viejo_. They likewise kept for a longtime Annual
Feast-Days, on which they lamented the loss of the Gyants, which (as
they say) was as followeth:

A Youth glittering in glory like the Sun descended from Heaven, and
breath’d Fire, which rending the Rocks so terrifi’d the Giants, that
they fled into a deep Cave, where they were all kill’d.

[Sidenote: _Helvius_ finds the Bones of the Giants.]

_Cornelius Whitefleet_ relates, That _Helvius_, Governor of _Puerto
Viejo_ being stirr’d up by the Report of the fore-mention’d Images,
caus’d all the Graves to be broke open, in some of which he found Bones,
which they suppos’d to be Whale-Bones, had not the Sculls manifested the
contrary.

[Sidenote: The original of the Kingdom of _Peru_.]

[Sidenote: The original of the _Ingas_.]

Concerning the original of the Kingdom of _Peru_ the Natives give this
Account of it: That the most antient Inhabitants flock’d together like
wild Beasts, without constant Abodes, Customs, Laws, or Governors, which
salvageness is still retain’d in many Parts, amongst the _Brasilians_,
_Chunches_, _Chiruguanes_, _Yscayungus_, _Piloconens_, most of the
_Floridans_, _Chinchemecos_, and others, which degenerate from all
Humanity. In time when some kind of Government began to be observ’d, it
was rather Popular than Monarchical; yet generally those that were most
powerful, valiant and subtile, bore the greatest sway: Amongst whom the
first that five Ages since Commanded over the Inhabitants of the Valley
_Cusco_, was _Ingaroca_, a subtile and politick Person, who built the
Fort _Pucora_, Eastward near the Foot of the Mountain _Andes_, that so
he might bridle the People which inhabited in those Parts between the
Rivers, Moors, and Lakes, where the remainders of the Fort are to be
seen at this day: Moreover, he conquer’d all the Countrey along the
Southern Ocean towards the North and South, giving out that he was
extracted from one of the seven _Ingas_ (by which Name the _Peruan_
Kings have been styl’d ever since) which came out of the Cave
_Pacaritambo_, where they were preserv’d against the Deluge (of which
the _Heathens_ in _America_ had long since an obscure knowledge,) and
restor’d the drowned Families; wherefore every one not onely obey’d, but
paid him Tribute, and bound themselves to receive of him the true
Religion, which they desir’d he would teach them, as none knowing the
same better than he, whom they look’d upon as Extracted from the
_Ingas_. Amongst these _Ingas_ the chiefest was said to be _Mangocapa_,
who, according to their fabulous Tradition, climb’d through the Window
_Tambo_ out of the Cave _Pacaritambo_, and produc’d two Families, _viz._
_Hunan Cusco_, and _Urin Cusco_; from the first whereof _Ingaroca_
affirm’d himself Descended, and having first made himself Master of all
the Countreys about _Cusco_, rais’d the Family _Vicaquiquirao_, and laid
out a great part of his Revenues upon Gold and Silver Utensils, and
Ornaments for his Person and House, which he in his last Will charg’d
that none of his Successors should inherit, nor dwell in his Palace, but
that every one should build a new Habitation for themselves: He also
erected divers Golden Idols.

[Sidenote: _Yaguarguoqu_ the second _Inga_.]

[Sidenote: _Viracocha Inga_ his great Riches.]

Some Authors begin this _Dynastie_ of the Kings of _Peru_ in a very
different manner, making _Mango Capa_ to be the first thereof, and to
have been Succeeded by his Son _Chincaroca_, which cannot but be the
same with this _Ingaroca_ here mention’d. _Yaguarguoqu_ (that is, _Crier
of Blood_, because on a time being Commander, and taken Prisoner, out of
vexation and exceeding grief he cried _Blood_). Succeeding him after his
Death, rais’d the Family _Aocaillipanaca_, and was Succeeded by his
eldest Son, the wealthy _Viracocha Inga_, of whom, when the _Spaniards_
conquer’d _Peru_, went a Report, that great Riches lay buried in the
Earth with him; wherefore _Gonzalus Pizarrus_ tortur’d the Natives after
an inhumane manner, to know of them where the Grave of the said _Inga_
was; at last obtaining his Desire, he digg’d for the Body, which he
found so well Embalm’d, that it seem’d to live, but no Gold with it;
wherefore _Pizarrus_ deceiv’d in his expectation, burnt the Corps; the
Ashes whereof the _Indians_ gathering in Urns, worshipp’d, though when
he liv’d the Vulgar were much incens’d at him, for taking upon him the
Name of _Viracocha_, who was their supream God and Creator of all
things; but he pacifi’d them, saying, That _Viracocha_ appearing to him
in a Dream, had commanded him to take that Name upon him.

[Sidenote: _Yupangui_’s Policy to gain an Opinion amongst the People.]

[Sidenote: Gross superstition.]

The fourth _Inga_, call’d _Pachacuto Yupangui_ succeeded in the Throne
after the Death of his eldest Brother, who was slain in a Field-Battel
against the _Changas_, inhabiting the Valley _Andaguailas_, where the
_Peruan_ Army was utterly defeated, few of them onely escaping by
flight; among whom was _Yupangui_, who perswaded the rest to a subtile
Design, by alledging, That the Almighty Creator, angry at their
Destruction, had reveal’d many Secrets to him, _viz._ That the Creator
in Heaven was call’d _Viracocha Pachayachachie_; That he resented it
very ill; That whereas he formerly made Heaven, Sun, Moon, Stars, and
Men, none worshipp’d him for it, but in stead of him they reverenc’d the
Sun, Thunder, and the Earth, who had their Beings from him; That he
would shew his Power against the victorious _Changas_ by an unexpected
Assistance of an invisible Army. This being believ’d of every one,
stirr’d up the _Peruans_ far and near, insomuch that in a short time a
vast Army being rais’d, presented themselves to _Yupangui_, who made
good use thereof; and also told them that _Viracocha_ had decreed in
Heaven, that he _Yupangui_ should be his Vicegerent on Earth; which the
Army believing, set the _Peruan_ Crown which they had taken from his
Father, on his Head: Thus promoted, he march’d against the _Changas_,
whom in a bloody Battel he Conquer’d, and brought them all under his
Obedience: Moreover, he made his Soldiers believe, that they were not
the Conquerors, but invisible Men, whom _Viracocha_ had sent, and who
could be seen by none but himself; and that after the Battel they were
turn’d into Stones, which they must seek for. Whereupon they gathering a
great number of Stones on the Mountains, _Yupangui_ call’d them
_Pururancas_, and order’d that they should be worshipp’d, and carried
with them into the Field whensoe’re they fought another Battel, hoping
thereby to stir up his Soldiers to be couragious, who firmly believ’d,
that with the visible Stones walk’d invisible Heroes that would
certainly assist them. This Imagination wrought so much, that
_Yupangui_’s Army assur’d of Victory with the help of the Stones, went
on undauntedly on all Designs, insomuch that being fear’d by all the
adjacent People, he forc’d them all to submission. This _Yupangui_
rais’d the Family _Yuaupococa_, and plac’d a great Golden Image call’d
_Indyllapa_ on a Golden Chariot, which since was religiously worshipp’d,
and afterwards carried to _Caxamalca_, for a Ransom of the _Peruvian_
King _Attabaliba_, whom the _Spanish_ General _Pizarrus_ kept Prisoner,
and at last Strangled. The Councellor _Polus_ opening _Yupangui_’s
Grave, found the Body Embalm’d, and no way defaced, but the Eyes cover’d
with thin Golden Plates, and on his Head appear’d the Scar of a Stone
which had been thrown at him; and though the Body had lain eighty years
in the Grave, yet it seem’d rather living than dead, being onely a
little grey. This Corps, as also several other _Inga_’s, the Marquess
_Camette_ brought from _Cusco_ to _Lima_, so to prevent the _Peruvians_
worshipping of them.

[Sidenote: The Greatness and Riches of _Guayacava_.]

_Yupangui_ after his Decease was succeeded by _Sopa Inga_, and he by his
Son of the same Name, who rais’d the Family _Ayoac Aillo_: The last (for
nothing worthy of memory was done by either of them,) was succeeded by
_Guaynacava_, a wealthy and valiant young Man, who was no sooner setled
on the Throne, but he manag’d all things with great prudence, maintain’d
War with several People, and conquer’d the Kingdom of _Quito_, four
hundred Leagues beyond _Cusco_, whither after his Death his Body was
carried, and buried in the famous Temple of the Sun, but his Entrails
were buried in _Quito_ not without many bloody Offerings, thousands of
his Servants Sacrificing themselves at his Grave willingly, that so they
might serve their Prince in the other World. The invaluable Treasures
which he left behind him were carefully hid by the _Peruvians_ till the
_Spaniards_ conquer’d that Countrey: The pav’d Ways, magnificent
Buildings, and strong Castles, testifie as yet the Power of this _Inga_;
wherefore in his life-time he was honor’d as a God. His Mother
_Mamaoclo_ liv’d to see above three hundred of her Children’s Children,
all Extracted from her Son _Guaynacava_.

[Sidenote: War between _Huascar_ and his Brother _Attabaliba_.]

[Sidenote: _Huascar_ burnt alive.]

The chief of the Family _Tanebamba_ were _Huascar_ and _Attabaliba_,
Sons to _Guaynacava_, (both by the _Coya_, or lawful Queen, however some
have deliver’d to the contrary) who falling at variance betwixt
themselves, resolv’d to decide the Quarrel by a Field-Battel, in which
_Attabaliba_, being the youngest, was Conqueror. This Civil War was at
the heighth when the _Spaniards_ invaded _Peru_, which they could never
have conquer’d, had not the Realm been so divided. During _Attabaliba_’s
Imprisonment by _Pizarrus_, his two Generals, _Quizaniz_ and
_Chilicuchima_, took the _Inga Huascar_ (formerly call’d _Tito Cusi
Gualpa_, _Attabaliba_’s Brother) in _Cusco_, and carrying him to the
Valley _Sacsahuana_, burnt him alive. It is set down as remarkable, that
_Huascar_ after his being vanquish’d, made great Offerings to
_Viracocha_, thereby to gain his assistance in his extremity against
_Attabaliba_; when he was inform’d, that a strange People which came
from a remote Place over the Seas, had defeated _Attabaliba_’s Army, and
taken him Prisoner: From which News _Huascar_ taking courage, call’d the
_Spaniards_ _Viracochas_, and judg’d that they were come from Heaven to
his Delivery, and the more, because his Brother had spilt so much Blood
already: for _Attabaliba_ had not onely slain the Prince _Atoco_, which
led _Huascar_’s Army, with three thousand two hundred Men, and drank out
of _Atoco_’s Skull tipt with Gold, but had also pluck’d out the Harts of
above a thousand Children, which the _Cannarites_ sent with Palm-Boughs
to him, to desire Peace.

[Sidenote: _Mango Inga_ Settles in the Mountain _Vilcabamba_.]

After _Attabaliba_’s and _Huascar_’s Decease, _Mango Inga_ their Brother
drove all the _Spaniards_ out of _Cusco_, whither they not long after
coming with new Forces, necessitated _Mango_, not without the loss of
many Men, to take his flight up into the Mountain _Vilcabamba_, where he
Setling, his Successors Reign to this day, secur’d from any Invasion by
the natural strength of the Place. But the _Inga Saritopa_ coming from
the fore-mention’d Mountain, submitted himself to the _Spaniards_, who
allow’d him the Valley _Yucay_ to dwell peaceably in; but the rest of
the Family of the _Inga_’s that fell into the Hands of the _Spaniards_,
were all of them kill’d in _Cusco_, not without great grief of the old
Inhabitants, to see so antient and noble a Family, by which they had
been Govern’d in great State for three hundred years together, put to
death by common Executioners.

[Sidenote: _Cusco_ the Residence of the _Peruvian_ Kings.]

The City _Cusco_, which was the Royal Seat of all the _Peruvian_ Kings,
was made more splendid than ever before, by _Guayanacava_, of whom
_Augustine de Tarrate_, describing his Magnificence, relates, That when
his Queen was Deliver’d of a Son, who was to succeed in the Throne,
_Guayanacava_ kept a great Feast for twenty days together, and on that
day when the Child was to be Nam’d, a Golden Chain, each Link of which
was as big as a Hand, and contain’d in all seven hundred Foot in length,
was carried by twenty _Peruvians_ to the Temple.

[Sidenote: The manner of the Succession of their Kings.]

The Succession of the _Inga_’s was after this manner: The _Inga_’s
keeping many Concubines had many Children by them, none of which could
lay claim to the _Peruvian_ Crown, but onely the Son begotten on the
_Coya_, or _Queen_, being generally the Kings own Sister, (whom they
accounted lawful for them to Marry, as in antient times did the
_Egyptian_ Kings) Inherited the Realm, unless the _Inga_ had a lawful
Brother, who Inherited before the Son, though born of a _Coya_; or if
the said Brother had a Son, he obtain’d the deceased Uncles Crown before
him, who in apparence was the elder Heir.

The same Succession was also observ’d by other Governors, which the
_Peruvians_ call _Curaca_’s.

[Sidenote: Their Burials and disposal of their Treasure.]

The Burials of their Kings were perform’d with great solemnity; and the
Treasures which they left behind were bestow’d in building of
magnificent _Guaha_’s, which were Temples or religious Houses, where a
kind of solemn Worship was to be perform’d, to celebrate the Memory of
the Deceased. Some part of the Treasure was also distributed amongst the
_Inga_’s Servants; but the Successor inherited not the least Mite of
what his Predecessor had gotten, but was forc’d, according to an antient
Law, to build himself a new Palace, and purchas’d anew every thing else
belonging to it.

[Sidenote: Their Crown.]

Their Crown or Diadem was onely a fine red woollen Coif with a Tassel,
that hung down over their Foreheads, which other meaner Princes wore
hanging on their right Ear.

[Sidenote: Their Coronations.]

Their Coronations were also kept in great Pomp and State, the Nobility
and Priests coming from all parts of the Countrey to _Cusco_, besides an
innumerable multitude of common People.

The Noblemens Presents to the _Inga_’s consisted chiefly of Gold and
Silver Vessels, fine Cloth call’d _Cumbi_, all sorts of Sea-shells, and
stately Plumes of Feathers of inestimable value.

Thousands of Sheep differing in colour serv’d for Offerings: moreover,
the Chief Priest sacrific’d a Child before the Image of _Viracocha_, on
whom with great Reverence he cry’d, _O great God_ Viracocha, _we Offer
you this Child, that you may keep our Realm in Peace, aid us in time of
War, prosper our_ Inga _in all his Undertakings, make him more powerful
and greater than any of his Predecessors, and grant him wisdom to Govern
this vast Countrey_.

[Sidenote: Their exact Form of Government.]

No People in the World can be more respective, and shew greater
Reverence to their Kings, than the _Peruvians_: for there were never any
heard of in this Countrey that ever Rebell’d against their Prince; the
reason of which was chiefly, because they always Govern’d with great
Justice and Mildness, placing Governors over the respective Countreys
and Provinces, according to their several Divisions, greater or lesser,
with subordinate Power one under another, so that they Rul’d with great
strictness, punishing with Death both Drunkenness and Theft. Moreover,
the _Ingas_ observ’d a prudent way in Government, _viz._ They kept their
Subjects continually employ’d: The ordinary sort of Persons of subdu’d
Provinces were sent to remote Countreys, and the Governors thereof kept
at the Court in _Cusco_; and Princes Descended of the Royal Blood sent
in their Places to Govern the new gotten Dominions: they divided the
Inhabitants into Companies, plac’d one to Command over ten, another over
a hundred, and a greater Officer over a thousand, and at last a
_Prefect_ or Major-General, over ten thousand; every one of which
Officers were to bring in an Account every Week to the supream Governor,
who was always of the _Inga_’s Family, what Men dy’d of their number, or
how many were born, a present Estimate of every ones Stock, in Cattel or
otherwise, and all remarkable Transactions that hapned. On the high
Feast-day they were all to appear at Court, and to bring in the Revenues
gather’d out of their Substitute Countreys. The main Division of the
Countrey was into four grand Provinces, call’d _Tahucantinsuyos_,
according to the four Ways that went from _Cusco_ through the whole
Realm, _viz._ _Chinchasuyo_ towards the North, _Coclasuyo_ towards the
South, _Andesuyo_ towards the East, and _Condesuyo_ towards the West.
The Collectors were divided into _Hanansayos_, Upper-Collectors, and
_Urinsayos_, or Under-Collectors. The _Quipocomayos_, or Accomptants,
could cast up exactly with Buttons, not onely what every Province, but
also what each Man was to pay, and that according to the ability of the
Countrey and Person.

[Sidenote: Their stately Structures.]

Many were the stately Temples, invincible Castles, magnificent Palaces,
and other wonderful Structures built by the _Ingas_, the chiefest
whereof stood in _Cusco_, _Tiaguanaco_, and _Tambo_; the Builders
whereof were sent for by turns out of the adjacent Countreys, from which
they brought exceeding great Stones, most of them thirty eight Foot
long, eighteen broad, and six thick, which were so neatly joyn’d
together with Mortar or Iron-work, that a whole Edifice seem’d to be one
entire Stone. Their Bridges that led cross the Rivers were made of Flags
and Rushes, fastned to each Shore with great Ropes. The like Bridge lay
cross the deep Mouth of the Lake _Chicuito_, on which great Bundles of
the Rushes _Toto_ being ty’d together, and cover’d with Straw, so
strengthen’d the Bridge, that great Loads were safely carried over the
same.

[Sidenote: The great Riches of the _Ingas_.]

No Prince ever possess’d so much Riches and Splendor as an _Inga_ of
_Peru_, each Countrey presenting him with what was most esteem’d amongst
them; the _Chiches_ bringing Sweet-woods; the _Lucanas_, strong
Sedan-Carriers; the _Chumbibilcas_, brave Dancers; and so accordingly
every Countrey provided him with what they best esteem’d, besides the
usual Tributes which they paid.

Those which digg’d the Gold and Silver out of the Mines, had Meat,
Drink, and Clothing from the _Inga_, though at other times he enjoy’d
the Labors of his Subjects for nothing.

[Sidenote: Their several sorts of Tribute from conquer’d Countreys.]

When at any time he conquer’d a Countrey by force of Arms, he made them
pay from three several sorts of Tribute; the first was bestow’d in
religious Offices. Each _Guaca_ or Chappel receiv’d also a Revenue from
the late conquer’d Countreys, the Fruit of which serv’d for Offerings to
their chief God _Pachayachachu_, the Sun, their Thunderer _Chuquilla_,
and to the Souls of the Deceased, and for Food for the Priests. The
Religion through the whole Realm agreed with that which was observ’d in
_Cusco_. But the second Tribute fell to the _Inga_’s Family, or Relation
and Soldiers. Those who Till’d the _Inga_’s Ground, Sung before him in
Festival Clothes. That which could not be spent in the Court was laid up
in Store-houses for ten years together, against a scarcity should
happen. Aged People, Widows, and such as were decrepid, paid no Tribute.
The third part was for the Poor, which had every Year a piece of Ground
allow’d them to make use of as they pleas’d. In unfruitful Years they
receiv’d an Allowance out of the Store-houses before mention’d.

[Sidenote: Their Provision for the Poor.]

So likewise the Pasture, Meadows, and Arable Land was order’d for three
several Uses, one third for religious Uses, a second for the _Inga_’s,
and the last for the Poor. The Sheep being shorn on a certain Day,
yielded the Poor a certain quantity of Wooll to make them Clothes. As
soon as any Beast grew Mangy (which the _Peruvians_ call’d _Carache_)
they burnt them alive, so to prevent the spreading of it farther. Those
that belong’d to the _Inga_’s Family, wore all Clothes made of the
finest Wooll, and the coursest, call’d _Tabasca_, was distributed among
the Vulgar.

[Sidenote: Their Industry.]

Besides this good Order of Government, it is wonderful to observe the
_Peruvians_ manner of Living, each learning from their Infancy not onely
a Trade, but all things which they accounted necessary in House-keeping,
as Weaving, Tilling of Land, building of Houses, and making of Tools
requisite for both; so that they never made use of one another on any
Account. Moreover, Master Artists, who work’d more for Pleasure than
Gain, dwelt apart, being Silver-smiths, Painters, Musicians, and
Dancers.

[Sidenote: Their Habits.]

Their Habits were heretofore of one fashion through the whole Realm,
onely the Covering of their Heads were several, by which the People of
one Countrey were distinguish’d from the other, according to an
inviolable Law made many Ages since; some therefore wore thin Caps,
others broad Pleits, others little Hats, others round Bonnets, others
woven Caps, and the like.

[Sidenote: Their Post-Stages.]

Their Post-Stages, call’d _Chasquis_, were little Houses, each standing
a League and a half from one another, wherein dwelt certain Officers,
who with extraordinary speed convey’d the _Inga_’s Letters from one
_Chasquis_ to the other; after which manner in two days time they
convey’d a Letter a hundred Leagues. But since the _Spaniards_ conquer’d
this Countrey, that Convenience was lost, till the tenth _Peruvian_
Vice-Roy _Martin Enriques_ re-establish’d the same; for he allow’d a
Sallary to those Posts, that they might with speed convey all Letters
and Packets from one to the other, being distant, according to his
Establishment, four Leagues.

[Sidenote: Their severe Laws against Malefactors.]

Lastly, the _Ingas_ maintain’d strict Laws in criminal Affairs; for as
they did not neglect to encourage noble Atchievements (for whoe’re had
done a valiant Act in the Wars, was made Governor of a Countrey, or had
a certain quantity of Land given him, or Married one of the _Inga_’s
Family;) so likewise they severely punish’d all Malefactors: for
Murderers, Thieves, and Adulterers suffer’d Death without Mercy; yet
they allow’d store of Concubines, and it was free for any one to Lie
with his Neighbor’s Concubine, but Death to have to do with any Man’s
lawful Wife, who were serv’d by the Concubines.

[Sidenote: Their Marriages.]

When a Bridegroom Betrothed himself to his Bride, he gave her (and put
them on himself) a pair of Shoes call’d _Ajota_, not unlike those of a
grey Fryer, which were lin’d with Cotton if she were a Maid, but with
Leaves if a Widow, who nevertheless being generally younger than the
Man, was to Mourn a whole year in Black for her deceased Husband; till
the expiration of which time she was not to Marry another. Governors of
Provinces and other Officers of State receiv’d their Wives from the
_Ingas_, who enquiring out the beautifullest and most accomplish’d
Virgins they could hear of, put the _Ajota_ on their Feet, and gave them
to such Persons as they most fancied; after which if they committed
Adultery they were certainly put to death. The Marrying of Brothers and
Sisters was also forbid, till the Inga _Topa Yupangui_, Father to
_Guaynacava_ broke that Law, by Marrying his own Sister _Mamoello_, and
made an Order that the _Ingas_ onely should have that liberty; nay, when
he lay on his Death-bed, he strictly charg’d his Son _Guaynacava_ to
take his own Sister _Goya Cuissilmay_ to Wife; and this incestuous
Marriage produc’d _Huascar_ and _Attabaliba_, (though some say
_Attabaliba_ was begotten on a Concubine) in whose time the _Peruvian_
Kingdom went to ruine. _Guaynacava_ also permitted the common People to
Marry their Sisters of the Fathers side, but not of the Mothers.

[Sidenote: Their manner of living.]

The _Peruvian_ Houses were antiently for the most part light and small;
and for their Table they made but little preparation, satisfying
themselves with a little Beer made of Rice, Bread bak’d of _Maiz_, dry’d
Flesh, Fish, and Roots.

In their Wars they us’d Slings, Darts, Arrows, Lances, Pikes, Halberds,
Pole-Axes, and Shields.

[Sidenote: Their Funerals.]

Their Funerals were also solemnly kept, especially those of Persons of
Quality, the Corps was carried out on a brave Chair, from which he was
put into the Ground, with two of his Concubines whom he best affected,
and also three Servants, Gold and Silver Vessels, _Maiz_, and the Liquor
_Chica_, which the nearest Relation spurted into his Mouth through a
Cane; all which they did that the Deceased might make use thereof in the
other World. But before the Funeral the Relations Mourn’d over the Corps
several days, and after the Body was Interr’d, they plac’d the Picture
of the Deceased upon the Grave: but the meaner sort of People had the
Tools belonging to their Trade; and Soldiers their Arms plac’d on the
same.

[Sidenote: Their Religion.]

In their Religion they had various Fancies; their prime God _Viracocha_
bore several Denominations, and amongst others he was call’d
_Pacachame_, or _Pachayachachick_, by which he was signifi’d to be the
Creator of Heaven and Earth; as also _Usapu_, that is, _Wonderful_. In
honor to this _Pacachama_ stood formerly a magnificent Temple about four
Leagues from _Lima_, where the Ruines still manifest its former glory,
it being the Place where the Devil answer’d the Priests, who stood with
their Backs towards the Image of _Pacochame_, bowing their Heads to the
Ground, and showing many antick Tricks. The second Temple stood near
_Cusco_, in which the _Inga_’s had plac’d the Images of all the Gods and
Goddesses that were worshipp’d in _Peru_; and before each Image stood an
Altar: the chiefest of them, call’d _Puachao_, consisting of massie
Gold, was Dedicated to the Sun, on whose Forehead the Sun was Engraven
on a Plate, which afterwards fell into the Hands of the _Spanish_
Captain _Mancius Sierra de Lequizamo_; but because he lost the same one
Night at Gaming, this Proverb was rais’d upon it, _Lequizamo lost the
Sun before it rose_, because he got the Plate on which the Sun was
Engraven in the Afternoon, and lost the same in the Night: The Temple it
self, built of great Stones, curiously joyn’d together in _Mosaick_
Work, and within link’d with Golden Plates of a Finger thick, stood full
of Golden Chappels and Altars; round about it were several Galleries,
into which the Priests and Priestesses Chambers open’d. Near the River
_Ticiquaque_ a third Temple, Consecrated to the Sun.

[Illustration]

[Sidenote: The various Idolatry of the _Peruvians_.]

This kind of Idolatry was common to the _Peruvians_, with several other
Nations of the antient _Heathens_, as hath been before observ’d, which
made them mock at the _Spaniards_ when they told them of a Crucifi’d
_Saviour_, saying they had a splendid God, who appear’d to them in glory
every Morning. In the third Temple near the River _Taciquaque_ in
_Peru_, which exceeded the other two, they worshipp’d Thunder by the
Name of _Chuquilla_, _Catuilla_, and _Intillapa_, which the _Peruvians_
believ’d to be a Man that Commanded the Air, and who being Arm’d with a
Club and Sling, throws down Rain, Hail, and Snow from the Clouds, and
shooting Bullets through the lower Region, causes Thunder and Lightning:
They worshipp’d him after the same manner as they did _Viracocha_ and
the Sun, with holding up of a thing like a Glove, and sometimes
Offering, especially in _Cusco_, living Children: Also they ador’d the
Earth of which they made the Goddess _Bathamama_; also _Mamacocha_, the
God of the Sea. The Rainbowe, which the _Ingas_ carried between two
Serpents for their Arms, was also religiously worshipp’d. Amongst the
Stars they imagin’d _Colca_, by us call’d _Aries_, or the _Ram_, as
chief; yet held several others of peculiar Denomination, in veneration,
of which they crav’d such things as they wanted. The Shepherds ador’d
the Star _Nereuchilla_ or _Capricorn_, whom they judge to Rule over the
Beasts. Others worshipp’d _Machacuay_ which the _European_ Astronomers
call the _Serpent_, as commanding Serpents and Dragons, that they might
receive no hurt from them. Tygers, Lyons, and Bears, were Rul’d by the
Star _Chuquichinchag_; wherefore those who would walk free from those
ravenous Beasts, lifted up folded Hands to the Constellations
representing the same. They believ’d that there was no Creature living
on Earth, whole Likeness the Heavens could not afford; and that those
which were on Earth were under the influence of those in Heaven: from
hence proceeded the Names of the Stars _Chacana_, _Topatatca_, _Mamana_,
_Mirma_, and others. They likewise attributed a kind of Divinity to
Fountains, Rivers, Rocks, Mountains, some kinds of Herbs, Roots, and
especially the _Papas_, of a strange shape, and had a veneration for all
manner of Creatures that were of an unusual form. When they travel’d
they strew’d Shoes, Plumes of Feathers, and _Cocoa_ in all cross Ways
and tops of Hills, by them call’d _Apachitas_; and if they want the
fore-mention’d things, then they throw a Stone for an Offering, from
whence it proceeds, that in all cross Ways, and on the tops of Hills,
lie heaps of Stones, which are accounted holy.

The like fond veneration of Stones the _Saracens_ are said antiently to
have had, upon a Tradition, That _Abraham_ had enjoy’d _Agar_ upon a
Stone, and that according to _Euthymius_ and _Libanius_, he ty’d his
Cammel to a Stone when he went to Offer his Son _Isaac_.

The Images of their deceased _Ingas_, which they call’d _Guaoiqui_, were
had in great honor, and carried with them to the Wars, and up and down
in Processionings, and call’d upon for fruitful Seasons.

[Sidenote: The _Peruvians_ believ’d the Immortality of the Soul.]

The Immortality of the Soul, the giving of Punishments to the Wicked,
and of Rewards to those that do well, was generally believ’d amongst the
_Peruvians_, but not the Resurrection of the Dead. Many suffer’d
themselves to be buried with their Friends, that they might accompany
them to the other World. When the Inga _Guaynacava_ was buried, above a
thousand of his Courtiers Sung several Songs, kept a great Feast, and
went with great joy to be buried with him, that so they might serve
their King on the other side of the Mountains. They Offer’d likewise a
great number of Children, and with their Blood cross’d their Faces from
one Ear to another: But this barbarous Offering was never us’d but at
the Death of prime Persons of Quality; for the meaner sort of People set
onely Meat on the Graves, and gave the Dead two Sutes of Apparel, put
Money in their Mouthes and Hands; for they believ’d that the Souls
ranging up and down from place to place, suffer’d many inconveniences.

[Sidenote: Their Oracle.]

[Sidenote: Their Nunneries.]

[Sidenote: Their Offerings.]

The _Peruvian_ Images consisted generally of Gold, Silver, Stone, or
Wood, all of them strangely deform’d: Some of them were said to give
Responces like the Oracle at _Delphos_ and _Dodona_, chiefly in the
Temple _Pacachama_, whose greatness is sufficiently manifest by the
Ruines of its Walls beyond _Lima_, where _Franciscus Pizarrus_ got an
invaluable Treasure. Each _Peruvian_ Province had a Temple, besides
which, in the Cities, Villages, and Hamlets, were Chappels of Ease, into
which the Priests went at Night with their Backs towards the Idol,
bended Heads and Bodies; in which posture they requested to know future
Events, and were many times answer’d (if we may believe their Reports)
in a terrible Voice. The great Temple at _Cusco_, wherein the _Ingas_
had plac’d all the _Peruvian_ Idols, is now turn’d into a _Dominican_
Cloyster. In each Province of _Peru_ was also a Nunnery (if we may so
term it) or Habitation of devoted Virgins, call’d _Allaguau_, i.e. _A
House of the Choicest_, over which Was plac’d a Governor nam’d
_Appopanaca_, to whom none durst deny their Daughters; some of which
were styl’d _Wives of the Sun_, and others Servant-Maids to the same:
The Wives Cloth’d in Embroyder’d Coats, adorn’d the Temple, whilest the
Maids kept clean the Walls and Floor. When they attain’d to fourteen
Years of Age, some were chosen out from the rest, and oblig’d to
perpetual Virginity and solitude of Life in their Chappels; which sacred
Obligation if they broke by suffering any to Lie with them, they were
buried alive after the manner of the Vestal Virgins, the Ceremony
whereof is related by _Plutarch_: Others were oblig’d to make daily
Offerings; others to make peculiar Sacrifices for the _Inga_’s Health,
and happy Events in War; many also were employ’d in the Court Service to
wait upon the _Inga_’s Wife or Concubines; and those being absolv’d from
their Vow, were oft-times Married to Courtiers. These Nunneries were
Endow’d with great Revenues from the _Chacaras_, or Church-Lands. Their
Offerings were (for sometimes they Offer’d to their Idols the highly
esteem’d Herb _Cocoa_, _Maiz_, several colour’d Plumes, Sea-Monsters,
Gold and Silver Images of Beasts, fine Clothes call’d _Cumbi_,
Sweet-wood, and Tallow to burn) either to have success in their
Journeys, Trades, or for the preservation of Health, or to obtain a
plentiful Harvest. But their usual Offerings were _Cuces_, a sort of
Toads, which were eaten by the _Peruvians_. When they were to do any
Business of consequence, then Persons of Quality kill’d their Sheep
_Pacos_, not without strange observation of the colour and number of
them, as also of the time; all which things well consider’d, they cook
the Sheep and laid it cross their right Arm, turn’d the Face thereof
towards the Sun, and mutter’d several words to themselves according to
the colour; for if it was spotted grey, they spoke to _Chuquilla_, or
Thunder; if white and short Fleec’d, to the Sun; if well Fleec’d, to
_Viracocha_. In _Cusco_ they Offer’d daily a short-fleec’d Sheep to the
Sun in this manner: Making a great Fire call’d _Vibbacaronca_, the
Priests threw the Sheep and four Baskets of _Cocoa_ into it. Their
Sacrifices _Cozocovicca_ and _Sapovicca_, to obtain Conquests, were also
very strange: for they gather’d out of _Puna_ (which is a desolate
place) several sorts of Brambles and Bushes nam’d _Ganilli_, which being
all set on fire, they went about the Fire with round Stones in their
Hands, on which were painted Serpents, Lyons, Toads, and Tygers, crying,
_Usachum, grant us Conquest_, together with this Prayer, _Destroy, O
Creator, the power of our Enemies Gods_; which said, several starv’d
Sheep were brought out, which for that reason they call’d _Urca_; whose
Hearts having torn out they began their Prayers afresh, saying, _Mighty_
Viracocha, _thus do thou pull out the Hearts of our Enemies_. For the
prosperity of the _Ingas_ they kill’d in an open Field black Dogs, by
them call’d _Appurucos_, whose Flesh was eaten with many Ceremonies by
People appointed for that purpose. They made Offerings also to the
Fountains, Rivers, Brooks, and Sea-shells, under pretence that those
Shells were Daughters of the Ocean, and the Ocean the Father of Streams
and Springs; when they had Sow’n their Fields, their Priests, chose to
that Office, went from House to House to gather such Offerings as every
one was pleas’d to give; which they laid at the Banks of several Sluces,
at the time when the Water began to rise there, thinking by that
Oblation to keep them from over-flowing their Lands, and washing away
their Seed. In all places where two Rivers joyn’d together they wash’d
themselves, having first bedaub’d themselves all over with stamp’d
_Maiz_, and afterwards look’d upon themselves as well purg’d from Sin;
which power they ascrib’d to their Baths. To strangle Children between
four and ten years of Age was never us’d, unless upon the _Inga_’s being
sick, or when he receiv’d the Royal Tassel, that from the death of the
Children he might receive Health, or Reign prosperously. The
fore-mention’d Nuns that were chose to attend on the King’s, were also
strangled when the _Inga_ was sick; nay, sometimes a Father would Offer
his Son to _Viracocha_, on the Sun-Priest’s suggestion, That by his
Son’s death he would recover from his Sickness, Praying to the
foremention’d Deity, that they would be pleas’d to save the sick Father,
because the Son had with his Death paid for his Fathers.

This kind of Cruelty the Devil seem’d to prompt the _Heathens_ to, by
making use of _Abraham_’s Example, who prepar’d his Son _Isaac_ for a
Sacrifice on Mount _Moria_; and that it was a Practice amongst the
antient _Ammonites_ and _Moabites_, and other _Heathens_ (by which even
the Children of _Israel_ were apt to be seduc’d) appears from the
Scripture it self: the Ceremonies of which bruitish Customs, with the
seven Brazen Chambers of _Moloch_, may be seen describ’d by _Rabbi
Solomon_.

[Sidenote: Their High Feasts.]

The high Feast _Capacrayne_, which the _Peruvians_ kept in the first
Moneth _Rayme_, agreeing with our _December_, deserves serious
observation: for as long as the Feast lasted, no Stranger was suffer’d
to Lodge in _Cusco_, whither they all flock’d again after the Feast was
over, to receive Cakes made by the _Mamaconas_ (an Order of Nuns) of
_Maiz_ and the warm Blood of a white Ram, and were distributed by
certain Priests (Extracted from the Royal Family _Iluqui Yupangui_) who
carrying them up and down in Golden Dishes, gave every one of a Company
one, saying at the delivery of it, _If you do not Reverence the Sun and_
Inga, _this Food will witness against you to your Ruine; but if you
worship them, then their Bodies will by this Pledge be united to yours_:
after which those that had eaten of the Cakes promis’d Obedience, and
thank’d the Sun and _Inga_ for their Food.

[Sidenote: Their Manner of Confessions.]

[Sidenote: Their Penances.]

[Sidenote: The Esteem of their Soothsayers.]

At the fore-mention’d _Chasquis_ a course was taken to carry all that
desir’d, to every Temple through the whole Kingdom of _Peru_, where the
Inhabitants receiv’d them with great Reverence, having before confess’d
all their sins to their _Yaburies_, or Father-Confessors, who being
chosen to that Office with a great deal of Ceremony, impos’d greater or
lesser Penances, according to the sins of the Penitent: those that were
suspected to have conceal’d any of their sins, were put to cast Lots, or
had the Entrails of the Beasts which they had kill’d to that purpose
consulted about them, and thereby were discover’d if they had conceal’d
any of their sins; which whenever it hapned, the Priests falling upon
the false Penitents, thump’d them with a Stone on their Backs so long,
till they had confess’d all their Faults, which the Priest was not to
reveal on pain of Death, but to make Expiatory Offerings. The sins about
which they were Examin’d, were chiefly Theft, Murder, Adultery,
preparing of Poyson, or sleighting their _Inga_ or Gods; for each of
which Transgressions they had several kinds of Punishments. When the
_Inga_ fell sick, all People in general were forc’d to come and make
Confession of their sins; also every one went to his Confessor when he
was in trouble, or expected some Misfortune to befall him: The _Inga_
himself Confess’d his sins to none but the Sun, which he desir’d to
relate to _Viracocha_, and to beg pardon of him for the same; which
done, he bath’d himself in a running Stream, and cry’d, _I have made my
sins known to thee, O Sun; do thou, O River, wash away mine Iniquities,
and discharge them into the Sea, that they may never be more laid to my
charge_: which custom of Bathing, call’d _Opacuna_, was also us’d by all
other Penitents. A Father losing his Son by Death, was censur’d for a
great Sinner, wherefore he could not be permitted to be Confess’d before
he had been whipp’d with Nettles by a certain ill-look’d Officer
appointed for that end; after which their Fathers _Ychuris_ enjoyn’d
such Penances as they thought fit; some were order’d to last several
days; others to pay rich Garments, Silver, Gold, or the like; others
receiv’d a certain number of Blows; some were condemn’d to live on the
Mountains, excluded from the society of all Men. If their Sorcerers at
any time foretold a Fathers Death, then he immediately Sacrifis’d his
Son, that with his Death he might buy his own Life. No People were more
respected than their Soothsayers, as Men that could discover private
Thefts, Accidents that hapned in remote Countreys, and also future
Events, and so far their Credit amongst the Vulgar carried them, that
they undertook to tell the _Spaniards_ when their Countrey-men should be
Conquerors, and when defeated in the War they maintain’d against the
_Netherlanders_. There were also cunning Women, who making themselves
dead Drunk with _Chica_, with which they mix’d the Herb _Viloa_, and
afterwards coming to themselves again, answer’d all the Questions that
were proposed to them.

[Sidenote: Their monthly Feasts.]

The _Peruvians_ kept two sorts of Feasts, the first at certain times,
the others on special occasions; the set-Feasts were kept Monethly; on
the first Moneth _Rayme_, agreeing with our last Moneth _December_, as
aforesaid, they kept the great Feast _Capacrayme_, on which they brought
Multitudes of Sheep and Lambs for Burnt-offerings, besides Silver and
Gold. Not far from the Fire stood three Carv’d Images of the Sun, and
three others representing Thunder; and this was generally the Day of the
Installation of the young _Inga_’s, which was after this manner: The
chief Priest boring a Hole through his Ear, cover’d the upper part of
his Body with the holy Cloth _Guaras_, whilest the inferior Priests
whipt him with knotted Cords, and painted his Face with the Blood.
During these Ceremonies no Stranger was suffer’d to remain in _Cusco_,
but after the Feast was ended they all return’d, and as before, receiv’d
Cakes bak’d of _Maiz_ and Blood, as a testimony that they lov’d and
honor’d the _Inga_.

[Illustration]

[Sidenote: Their Harvest Ceremonies.]

[Sidenote: Their Feast _Ytri_.]

The three Images of the Sun before-mention’d they call’d _Apointi_,
_Churiunti_, and _Intiquaoqui_, that is, _Father-Sun_, _Son-Sun_, and
_Brother-Sun_. In like manner they nam’d the three Images of Thunder,
_Chuquilla_, _Catuilla_, and _Intillapa_; from which _Acosta_ judges
that the Devil had obscurely taught the _Peruvians_ the Mysteries of the
holy _Sacrament_ and _Trinity_, (that their glory might be eclips’d by
Idolatrous Errors) especially the last, which seems plainly to be
signifi’d by the _Peruvian_ Deity _Tangatanga_, whom they affirm’d to be
One in Three, and Three in One. And that other Nations also had a
glimpse of the same may be collected from _Philip Cluverius_, who
endeavors to demonstrate, that the antient _Germans_ and _Gauls_
obscurely ador’d the _Trinity_ in the midst of their _Heathenism_, under
the notion of _Sun_, _Moon_, and _Fire_, the Sun signifying the
_Father_, the Moon the _Son_, and the Fire the _Holy-Ghost_; to confirm
which he makes use of _Cæsar_’s Testimony, _viz._ _They onely esteem
those Gods whom they see, and those that assist them_, viz. _the_ Sun,
Vulcan, _and the_ Moon; _for they have never heard any thing concerning
any other Gods_. _Diodorus Siculus_ seems also to ascribe a glimpse of
this Mystery to the _Egyptians_, when he says, That the antientest
People in _Egypt_, when they view’d the World, and were amaz’d at all
things on the Earth, they judg’d that two Gods Govern’d them all, _viz._
the _Sun_ and _Moon_, by whom all things flourish’d and encreas’d; to
whom they added a third, namely _Fire_, to which they attributed a
Divinity, as conducing much to the increase and growth of all things.
The _Moon_, which was also call’d _Juno_, they judg’d to be the
Offspring of God, (for Son and Daughter were promiscuously taken) who,
according to _Homer_, Marrying with _Jupiter_, brought forth _Vulcan_,
which might haply be to them a Type or Figure of the _Holy-Ghost_,
proceeding from the _Father_ and _Son_: _Vulcan_ was by her plac’d a
President over the Fire, by which the _Heathens_ seem’d to imitate the
fiery Power of the _Holy-Ghost_, purifying and cleansing all things: and
this cleansing Power was aim’d at by _Romulus_, when, according to
_Dionysius Halicarnassensis_, he commanded his Soldiers to leap through
a Fire made before his Tent, that so they might be purifi’d from all
their Crimes. But it may be thought strange, that the _Peruvians_,
_Germans_, or _Egyptians_, lost in a Wood of gross Idolatry, could have
any apprehension, though never so obscure, of the holy _Trinity_, when
as the most nice and curious _Greek_ and _Roman_ Wits have made such
gross mistakes concerning God. But to return again to the _Peruvians_:
They kept their second Feast in the second Moneth _Camay_, on which they
threw the Ashes of their Offerings into the River, and follow’d them on
the Shore for the space of five Leagues, praying the River to carry the
Ashes to the Sea, where _Viracocha_ would receive them. In the third and
fourth Moneths they kill’d a hundred and ten black spotted and grey
Sheep. In the beginning of _May_ (by the _Peruvians_ call’d
_Hatuncuzqui_) they gather’d in their _Maiz_, and kept the Feast
_Aymorai_; after which they return’d home Singing from their Fields,
call’d _Chacra_, and carried a great heap of _Maiz_ with them, nam’d
_Perua_, wrapping it up in rich Garments; three Nights they continu’d
their Ceremonies, imploring the _Perua_ to preserve their Harvest of
_Maiz_ from any damage that might chance to come to it, and also to let
that grow prosperously which they should Plant next. Lastly, their
Sorcerers consulted whether the _Perua_ could last till the next year?
to which if they were answer’d _No_, they carried it into the Fields,
and burning it, made a new _Perua_, which when they knew to be
sufficient to last good a year, they carried it to the Granary in great
triumph. In the seventh Moneth _Ancayacuzqui_, they kept the Feast
call’d _Intraymi_, with a hundred Sheep, in honor of the Sun. They also
made several Images of the Wood _Quimia_, which they put in rich Habits,
strew’d the Ways with Flowers, Danc’d a strange Dance nam’d _Cayo_,
Singing several Songs. Persons of Quality put Golden Plates about their
Knees, as the common People painted them with divers Colours. In the
eighth Moneth _Chahua_ they kept the high Feast _Huarqui_, on which they
Offer’d a hundred grey Sheep; the like number, but of a Chesnut colour,
they Offer’d the following Moneth _Yupaquis_, besides a thousand
_Cuies_, that the Air, Water, or Sun, might not spoil their Plants.
Their Feast _Situa_ they kept on the tenth Moneth _Coyaraymi_ after this
manner: They gather’d all together on the first day before the Moon
rose, which no sooner appear’d, but they made a terrible noise, beat one
another with lighted Torches, then wash’d the Dirt from their Bodies,
and made themselves Drunk for four Days together. The eleventh Moneth
_Armaraimi_, was nam’d _Punchaiquis_, from the Feast they kept therein,
on which (besides the usual Offerings of eight hundred Sheep) they ty’d
a black Sheep to a Post without Meat, till such time as there fell store
of Dew. Their Feast call’d _Raymicantara Raiquis_, was kept in the last
Moneth _Ayamara_, on which their Youth were bor’d through the Ears.
Amongst the high Feasts which were kept on great occasions, the chiefest
was _Ytri_, against which they all made new Clothes after a peculiar
fashion, wearing their Cloaks muffled about their Heads; in which manner
they walked leisurely a whole Day and a Night; during which time none
durst either Eat or Drink, or open his Eyes: But after this serious
Processioning follow’d four days of extravagancy, as Drinking, Dancing,
and the like. In their Dances, which were to the sound of Drums, Pipes,
and Horns, they imitated all manner of Trades by strange motions of
their Bodies, besides divers other Frolicks and May-games which they
us’d at such times of Mirth and Festivity: But since the _Spaniards_
conquer’d _Peru_, all these _Heathenish_ Customs have been laid aside.

[Sidenote: The Destruction of the old Empire of _Peru_ foretold.]

As to the Prognostications and Fore-runners of the destruction of the
old Empire of _Peru_, it is reported, that _Guaynacava_, Father of the
last King _Attabaliba_, lying on his Death-bed in _Quito_, said to his
Princes, _This Realm, at present rais’d to the highest top of Eminency,
is hastning towards its Ruine; and though our Kingdom remain as yet free
from foreign Invasion, the Countreys round about are already conquer’d
and in Slavery: The Gods have call’d strange People from unknown
Regions, who by degrees will reach us also. With me, who am the twelfth_
Inga, _dies the Dominion of the mighty_ Peru. _A People of other
Fashions and Religion will subvert our Religion, Laws and Government,
and bring us under subjection to them._ There were also Signs and
Prodigies that portended the Dissolution of this Empire; amongst the
rest a great Eruption in the Province of _Tacinga_, which rending the
Earth asunder vomited up Flames of Fire; nor was it long e’re they were
fulfill’d, for whilest the _Peruvians_ were making of Offerings to
_Viracocha_ for the delivery of their imprison’d King _Huascar_, News
was brought to _Cusco_ of _Attabaliba_’s being taken; the Particulars
whereof, with other Matters touching the Conquest of this Kingdom by the
_Spaniards_, and how they pillag’d the Countrey, murder’d the
Inhabitants, and enrich’d themselves with their inestimable Treasures,
shall in order be related.

[Sidenote: Several Parties of the _Peruvians_ set upon the _Spaniards_
           and overthrow them.]

[Sidenote: They are beaten by _Alvarado_.]

The first that gave the _Spaniards_ notice of _Peru_, was an _Indian_
Prince call’d _Panguinaco_, who having been taken Prisoner, inform’d
_Vasquez Nunnez_ of the abundance or Gold and Silver which was to be had
there, who resolv’d to venture through a thousand Dangers into the South
Sea. After which _Francisco Pizarro_, _Ferdinand de Lugue_, and _Diego
de Almagro_, consulted upon this great Design, _Anno 1525._ _Pizarrus_
being order’d to Sail before with a Ship carrying a hundred and fourteen
Men, and _Almagro_ to follow with a Vessel carrying seventy Men, whilest
_De Lugue_ staid to manage the Affairs at home. Fifty Leagues Southward
from _Panama_, _Pizarrus_ found a small Neck of Land nam’d _Peru_, from
which it is most probable that great Kingdom afterwards receiv’d its
Denomination, though many deduce it from the River _Beru_, as before
mention’d: Thence Sailing to the main Continent of _Peru_, and Landing,
he lost several of his Men, and being himself desperately wounded,
return’d with ill success, whilest _Almagro_ missing of him, Landed
afterwards in the same place, and also lost several of his Men, and one
of his own Eyes: yet not long after they renew’d their Design, carrying
with them in two Ships and three Boats, three hundred stout Men, which
all suffer’d extream Hunger, and had they not happily gotten some
Sea-Crabs, they had without doubt all of them perish’d: at last Landing
on the Coast of _Catamez_, they were Encountred by a People whose Faces
were hung full of Golden Nails, and daily lost more and more of their
Men; upon which ill Successes the new _American_ Vice-Roy forbad the
farther discovery of _Peru_, and call’d home the remaining part from the
Island _Gallo_, so that _Pizarro_ kept with him but twelve Men, with
whom he went to the desolate Isle _Gorgona_, where he liv’d on
Sea-Snails, till he receiv’d Provisions from _Panama_; after which they
spent two years in making farther Discoveries upon the Coasts of _Peru_:
During which time he visited the Queen _Capullana_, and discover’d a
mighty Palace, where three of the twelve Men were kill’d, whose Memory
deserves to live for ever, because the World owes to their unheard-of
Valor the Discovery of the mighty Kingdom of _Peru_; but there are onely
left Recorded the Names of those nine Worthies who surviv’d that
Exploit, which were these following, _Nicholas de Rivera_, _Peter de
Candia_, _Juan Torre_, _Alonzo Briseni_, _Christophero Peralca_, _Alonzo
de Truxillo_, _Francisco Cuellar_, _Alonzo Molina_, and the Pilot
_Bartholomeo Ruyz_: With these nine _Pizarro_ Landed on the Isle _Puna_,
inhabited by a valiant People, who us’d Bowes, Darts, Silver Knives, and
Pikes tipt with Gold: From thence he steer’d his Course unto the Haven
_Tumbez_, where _Peter de Candia_ Landing, was met by forty thousand of
the Inhabitants, who conducted him to the Temple of the Sun, built by
the _Inga Guaynacava_, and adorn’d in the in-side with Golden Plates.
Not long after which _Pizarro_ was by an Order from the _Spanish_ Court
made Governor of _Peru_, to the great discontent of _Almagro_; which
Difference being decided, _Pizarro_ set out again with two hundred and
fifty Foot, besides Horse, with which he Landed a hundred Leagues lower
than before, where he got a great Mass of Gold and some Emeraulds of the
_Casique_, all which he sent to _Panama_, thereby to stir up the People
to come to _Peru_ to his assistance; where those that were at present on
the Place, besides other great Hardships which they suffer’d, were
miserably plagued with Ulcers in their Faces; yet they prosecuted their
Conquest as well as they could with what small Power was left them, and
had newly taken _Puerto Viejo_ when Captain _Bevalcazar_ and _Juan
Florez_ brought fresh Supplies of Men and Horse; with which Recruit
_Pizarro_ conquer’d the Valley of _Tumbez_; from whence they Sail’d over
to the Island _Punas_, where the friendly Entertainment they met with at
first, turn’d soon after into a bloody Battel: for the _Spaniards_ not
forbearing to prie into every House, and committing many Outrages, were
set upon by the Natives, whom having at last subdu’d, and being again
supply’d with new Forces by _Ferdinando Sotto_ from _Nicaragua_, they
return’d to _Tumbez_, where the Countrey was all in Arms upon the Report
of the _Spaniards_ Cruelties committed on the Island _Puna_, insomuch
that they Offer’d all those whom they took alive to their Gods, and slew
as many as they could conveniently meet with. _Pizarro_ having stay’d
about twenty days, went with his Brothers _Juan_ and _Gonsalves_, the
Captains _Sotto_ and _Bevalcazar_, and fifty Horse over the River
_Ambato_ about Mid-night, through a thorny Way betwixt Mountains, and
about Break-of-day fell upon the _Tumbezan_ Army, and having setled
things pretty well in those Parts, he built the City _St. Michael_ in
the Countrey _Tangazara_, along the River _De la Chira_, where he was
Complemented by two Agents from _Cusco_, who desiring Aid in _Huascar_’s
Name against his Brother _Attabaliba_, receiv’d for Answer, That he was
going to _Caxamalca_, as indeed he was, to find _Attabaliba_ there;
whose Commands that he should not approach prov’d all in vain: for
_Pizarro_, under pretence of Complementing him in his Catholick
Majesty’s Name, was no sooner admitted to his Presence, but he took him
Prisoner, and set for a Ransom upon him as much Gold as a Room of fifty
four Foot long and nine Foot broad was able to contain, as high as he
could just reach with his Hand held up: But the Gold coming slower than
was expected, _Pizarro_ was much incens’d thereat, whom _Attabaliba_
endeavoring to pacifie, alledg’d, That it could not possibly come
sooner, because the Way between _Caxamalca_ and _Cusco_, from whence the
Gold was to be fetch’d, was at a great distance: The truth whereof
_Pizarro_ resolving to try, sent _Sotto_ and _Peter del Baro_ to _Cusco_
in Chairs, carried by _Peruvians_ exceeding swift of Foot, and who if
they tir’d were successively reliev’d by others that attended, without
so much as setting down the Chair; being got about half way, they met
with _Attabaliba_’s Captain _Cilucuchuma_, he having taken _Huascar_
Prisoner, who requested _Sotto_ and _Baro_ that they would be pleas’d to
deliver him out of the Hands of his blood-thirsty Brother, for which
kindness he would pay three times as much Gold as _Attabaliba_ had
promis’d, who was not able to give any thing else but the Golden Plates
which were in the Temple of the Sun in _Cusco_; whereas _Huascar_ had
all the Treasure that was left by _Guaynacava_; which indeed was true,
for _Huascar_ had caus’d it privately to be buried, and put to death
those that did it, that so he might keep the place conceal’d where it
lay; insomuch that none could ever find it out to this day, though the
_Spaniards_ have tortur’d the _Indians_ with all imaginable cruelty, to
make them discover the place. But _Attabaliba_ inform’d by _Pizarro_ of
_Huascar_’s Imprisonment, seem’d to be exceeding sorry, and said, _I am
much troubled at the News of my Captain’s laying violent Hands on my
Brother_ Huascar, _whom I acknowledge my eldest Brother, and both of the
same Father and Mother; but I suppose he has no design to kill him, but
onely keeps him Prisoner, to bring him to grant me peaceably to enjoy
the Kingdom of_ Quito, _of late brought under subjection of the_
Peruvian _Crown_. _Pizarro_ not observing _Attabaliba_’s subtilty (who
design’d nothing but _Huascar_’s Death, out of fear that the _Spaniards_
upon his liberal promises to them, might promote him to the Throne)
comforted him as well as he could: whereupon _Attabaliba_ supposing that
_Pizarro_ would be little concern’d at the killing of his Brother
_Huascar_, gave speedy Order that he should be burnt alive, which
accordingly was put into execution; but before he was brought to the
Fire, he foretold his Brother _Attabaliba_’s cruel death. During which
time _Almagro_ came with fresh Supplies from _Panama_, eager to have a
share of the fore-mention’d Ransom, which at last was paid with
overplus; for by daily bringing in of Baskets of Gold, the Chamber was
fill’d up to the very top; but though _Attabaliba_ had more than
perform’d his Promise, yet Sentence of Death was pronounc’d against him
presently after he had been Baptiz’d: the Reasons of which wicked and
rash Condemnation were two; first the false Accusation of a _Peruvian_
Interpreter call’d _Philippillo_, who desir’d his Death, that then he
might with the more freedom enjoy one of his Wives; for _Attabaliba_
mistrusting the same, had complain’d thereof to _Pizarro_, saying, _That
his Imprisonment was not so grievous to him, as the thoughts of the
Adultery, acted against the strict Laws of his Countrey_; the Defiler of
an _Inga_’s Bed being not onely to be burnt with the Adulterers, but
also the whole Families of them, to the least Infant, their Houses to be
rac’d to the Ground, and their Land sow’n with Salt, as for ever curs’d.
The second cause of _Attabaliba_’s Death is laid on _Almagro_, who came
to _Peru_ with new Forces, and who fearing that none of the Gold which
_Attabaliba_ had the delivery of, would fall to his share, as not having
been in the Battel where _Attabaliba_ was taken, therefore order’d him
to be suddenly Strangled, that so the Booty might be equally divided.
Not long after _Pizarro_ conquering _Cusco_, got no less Treasure than
at _Caxamalca_. Here the Reign of the _Peruvian Inga_’s ceased, with
which before no Kings that ever Govern’d in the World were able to
compare in Riches and Glory. Their Palaces were round about adorn’d with
Golden Images; and they never ate but out of Golden Vessels, spitting in
the Hands of beautiful young Women of Noble Extract, were worshipp’d
like Gods both whilest living and when dead, all their Subjects being
their Slaves, and they the sole Lords of the whole Realm. In the interim
_Bevalcazar_ march’d from the new City _St. Michael_, with a hundred and
twenty Foot and eighty Horse, to assist the _Cannares_ against one of
_Attabaliba_’s Generals, who having spoil’d the Ways by digging Pits,
and covering them over with Bushes, resisted them in several places:
then marching to _Quito_ he burnt the City, after having kill’d a
hundred of the Natives, because they laughed at the _Spaniards_ Arrival.
Afterwards joyning with _Almagro_, he went back to _Cusco_, whither on
the Way he had News of _Quisquis_, _Attabaliba_’s General, and of his
Brother _Guaypalcon_, who making use of a Rock, threw down great Stones,
by the _Peruvians_ call’d _Galgas_, which in their Fall hitting others,
brought down a great number with them, by which means he not onely
defended the Place for the present, but kill’d fourteen _Spaniards_;
nevertheless distrusting his ability to keep it, he retreated to a steep
Mountain about Midnight, at the Foot whereof a Passage led over a deep
River, where he burnt all his Luggage that he could not carry with him;
also above fifteen thousand Sheep and four thousand Prisoners, became
wholly at the Discretion of _Almagro_, who leaving there Captain _Martin
Astete_, order’d him to build the Town _Truxillo_: In the mean time
_Quisquis_ was put to flight by _Pizarro_, and went to _Quito_, where he
lost many People, that were kill’d by _Bevalcazar_’s Guard; yet those
that were remaining chose rather to Fight to the last, than flye through
Wildernesses, and there be starv’d to death; which _Quisquis_
contradicting, was Stabb’d by his Captain _Guappalau_, and immediately
after cut to pieces. As soon as these Stirs were quieted, _Pizarro_
began to build the City _Los Reyos_, near a convenient Haven of the
Southern Ocean, whilest _Almagro_ marching to _Chili_ with two Troops of
Horse, and five hundred Foot, return’d without doing any thing
remarkable, except his taking the Interpreter _Philippillo_, (whom he
caus’d to be cut into four pieces) and his maintaining several Battels
against the _Chileses_, clad in Sea-Wolves Skins. In this Journey he
lost several of his Men on the Snowy Mountains. About this time a Ship
fitted out by _Gabriel Carvajal_, Bishop of _Placentia_, Sailing through
the _Straights_ of _Magellan_, ran into the Haven _Los Reyos_, out of
which the first Rats swam ashore that ever were in _Peru_, by which the
Countrey since suffering much damage, the Inhabitants call’d them
_Ococha_, that is, _Sinful Creatures_. Now all things on the _Spaniards_
side were tending to a quiet possession, when a new Accident arose,
which had like to have spoil’d all, for _Mango Inga_, _Attabaliba_’s
Brother, being releas’d out of Prison by _Juan Pizarro_, obtain’d leave
to go to _Yucaya_, to fetch the famous Golden Image _Machys_,
representing his Father _Guaynacava_: but he having now gotten his
Liberty slew all the _Spaniards_ which work’d in the Gold-Mines, took
the Castle of _Cusco_ by Storm, as also the City, after a Siege of eight
Moneths; which nevertheless was by _Francisco Pizarro_ soon re-taken,
and _Mango_ forc’d to flye into the Mountains _Andes_, after he had
kill’d several of _Almagro_’s Men; soon after _Almagro_ about Midnight
getting over the Walls, and taking _Ferdinando_ and _Gonsalvo Pizarro_,
and _Alphonso Alvarado_ Prisoners, condemn’d them all three to die,
caus’d himself to be proclaim’d Governor, and gave the Royal Tassel to
_Paulo Inga_, whilest _Gonsalvo_ and _Alvarado_ breaking Prison,
inform’d _Francisco Pizarro_ thereof (who then had obtain’d the Title of
_Marquess_, and for an Inheritance, the Province _Attabillos_;) he was
exceedingly troubled for his Brother _Ferdinand_, whose Enlargement he
thought would be best procur’d by making Peace with _Almagro_ and the
sooner, because the _Peruvians_ began to rebel against the _Spaniards_
in most places, slew divers Companies of them; amongst whom _Diego
Pizarro_ was set upon in a narrow Path call’d _Laucesta Parcos_, and
amongst the Mountains lost seventy Horsemen; and _Gonsalvo de Tapico_
sav’d not one of eighty Horse. Also the _Peruvians_ set upon three
hundred Troopers, Commanded by the Generals of the Horse, _Morgoveio_
and _Gaeti_, in a narrow Path, and rowl’d down great Stones from the
tops of the Mountains both before and behind them, so killing both Horse
and Man before they could put themselves into a posture of Defence,
insomuch that none escap’d with Life but two Troopers. _Francisco de
Godoy_, sent out of _Los Reyos_ with forty five Horse, upon Discoveries,
return’d also with great loss, being pursu’d twenty Leagues by the
_Peruvians_; against whom _Peter de Lerma_ being sent out with sixty
Horse, fought a whole day with them, and though few of his Men were
kill’d, yet many were wounded, and several taken: The victorious
_Peruvians_ retreating to the top of a sandy Mountain in the Night,
Offer’d the _Spaniards_ they had taken Prisoners, as a testimony of
thanks, to _Viracocha_, and afterwards stood drawn up near the City _Los
Reyos_ by the General _Tyzopangui_. The Marquess thus beset round, sent
for Aid from _New Spain_ and _Truxillo_, and also for _Alphonso
Alvarado_ to come back, who had been sent to discover the Countrey
_Chachepoyos_, and being gotten into a Desart, would without doubt have
perish’d for want of Water, had not some Horsemen riding somewhat out of
the Way, found Pits with fresh Water: notwithstanding which, five
hundred _Inacona_’s (for so the _Spaniards_ call’d the _Peruvian_
Slaves) died for Thirst. He was afterwards supply’d by _Gomez Tordoya_
with two hundred Men, by the help of whom, though encompass’d by the
Inhabitants near the Bridge _Lamucacha_, where began a fierce Battel,
_Alvarado_ was in the end Conqueror.

[Sidenote: Civil War between _Pizarro_ and _Almagro_.]

[Sidenote: The Marquess _Francisco Pizarro_ murdered.]

[Sidenote: His Original and the manner of his Rising.]

Whilest the _Spaniards_ found so much to do with the _Peruvians_, yet
they could not forbear more and more Clashing amongst themselves, the
Marquess commanding that _Almagro_ should surrender and leave the City
_Cusco_; but he refusing to obey, fortifi’d himself on the top of the
Mountain _Gaytara_, stopt the Ways by cutting down the Trees: but
_Ferdinando Pizarro_ getting up to the top along a private Way, made
such a confusion amongst them with Bolt-shot, that _Almagro_, who was
sick at that time, was forc’d to flye; which being told _Pizarro_, he
pursu’d him, and had doubtless utterly defeated him at that bout, had
not his Men, benumm’d with marching in the deep Snow, been taken with a
Distemper which made them as if they had been all Sea-sick, (for such is
the property of the Mountain _Guaytara_) insomuch that they could scarce
carry their Arms: Whereupon _Almagro_ was advis’d to oppose his
Pursuers, and that he need not doubt of the Victory; but he either
following his own Dictates, or being counter-advis’d, fortifi’d himself
in _Cusco_, whither _Ferdinand_ and _Gonsalvo Pizarro_ march’d against
him. _Rodrigo de Orgonnes_ Commanded _Almagro_’s Army, who being sick,
lay on the Walls of the City to see the Battel fought. The _Peruvians_,
who on each side were in the _Spanish_ Service, march’d in the Front: on
the twenty sixth of _April, Anno 1538._ the Fight began, in which the
_Almagrians_ did much mischief with Cross-bar shot amongst the
_Pizarrians_; yet _Almagro_’s Horse retreated first, being under the
Command of _Peter Valdivia_; soon after which the rest of his Army,
their Courage also failing, fled to the City; into which, as soon as
_Orgones_ being shot in the Head and slain, the Conqueror rush’d after
them, and took _Almagro_ Prisoner: yet notwithstanding this prosperous
beginning, he soon found himself in a great strait, since those which
remain’d alive of _Almagro_’s Party refus’d to serve _Pizarro_, and
murmur’d against him in all places, resolving to take _Almagro_ from him
by force, besides that _Pizarro_’s Soldiers grumbled that they were not
paid sufficiently for the many hazards which they had run: wherefore to
compose these Troubles as well as possibly he could, he banish’d all
whom he thought to be of the opposite Party, sent away the chief of his
own mutinous Soldiers with Captain _Peter de Candia_, to discover new
Countreys, put _Almagro_ to death, and march’d to _Callao_; where being
straitned for want of Provision, he made no stay, but got his Army with
much ado to _Cusco_. _Gonsalves Pizarro_ was likewise so set upon by the
Natives, that he lost a considerable number of Men: In short, the
_Pizarrans_ were defeated in all places, and at length the Marquess,
though forewarn’d by his Secretary _Antonio Picado_, was murder’d in his
own House in the City of _Lima_, otherwise call’d _De los Reyos_, by a
Bastard-Son of _Almagro_, nam’d _Diego_, in the Year 1541; his Body
dragg’d to the Church-yard, lay there to every ones view and derision,
till _John de Barbara_ buried the same. His Father _Gonsalvo Pizarro_,
sir-nam’d _The tall Citizen of Truxillo_, Commanding a Company of Foot
in _Navarre_, had two lawful Sons, _viz._ _Ferdinand_, who was murder’d
in the _Spanish_ Castle _Motta_, and _John_ that was slain in _Cusco_,
when _Mango Inga_ conquer’d the City, the other two, _Gonsalvo_ and
_Francisco_, being both Bastards; the last of which is said to have been
expos’d by his Mother in the Church Porch, and kept alive for several
days by sucking of a Sow, till his Father afore-mention’d finding him,
and acknowledging him for his Son, put him out to Nurse, and when he was
grown up set him to keep Swine; which course of Life he soon left, and
following _Alphonsus de Ojeda_, _Balboa_, and _Pedro de Avita_ in their
Expeditions, he quickly grew rich, and at last came to that heighth of
Honor and Command we have heard. _Francisco Martino de Alcantara_ was
also his Brother by the Mothers side onely. He was a Man who despis’d
all Dangers and Hardships, was so well experienc’d in Martial Affairs,
that he might well stand in competition with many of the antient Heroes.
In _Los Reyos_ he built two very artificial Water-Mills, a _Dominican_
Cloyster, and another for the Monks _De la Merced_, and likewise a
stately Palace for himself: He was both meek and affable; and though he
bore the greatest Command in the Emperor’s Name over the mighty Kingdom
of _Peru_, and got more Riches than ever any of the _Roman_, _Persian_,
_Grecian_, or _Assyrian_ Monarchs possess’d, yet he went in the same
plain kind of Apparel in the heighth of his Grandeur, as when he was but
in a low Condition; about his Neck he commonly ty’d a Linnen
Hankerchiff, with which he us’d to wipe the Sweat from his Face: in
peaceable Intervals he spent whole days in playing at Bowls, without any
distinction of Persons, chusing often to play rather with a Sea-man or
common Soldier, than a phantastick Gallant: He visited the meanest
Citizens, and many times us’d to eat with poor People, to whom he was
upon all occasions very noble and liberal; All his Designs he carried on
by the strength of meer natural Parts: for he was so very illiterate,
that he could neither Write nor Read; his Edicts were Sign’d with his
two Marks, betwixt which his Secretary writ _Francisco Pizarro_; he is
said to have had a Son which died young by _Attabaliba_’s Sister, who
came afterwards to be call’d _Donna Angelina_; he died in a very
unfortunate time, for upon his good success the _Spanish_ Power had
grounded their whole Designs, thinking with the _Peruvian_ Treasures, as
the Sinews of War, to have erected a fifth Monarchy to succeed the
fourth of the _Romans_.

[Sidenote: _Almagro_ utterly defeated by _Vacca de Castro_.]

[Sidenote: Deliver’d up Prisoner by _Salazar_, and Beheaded.]

_Pizarro_’s Murderer, though aiming at the Supream Power, he had a
considerable Party to countenance and aid him, yet he found resistance
in many places, not without the loss of many Men on both sides. In which
Juncture the Learned _Vacca de Castro_ Landed in _Peru_, with a
Commission from the Emperor to settle the divided Kingdom of _Peru_ in
Peace and Quiet; but the young _Almagro_ mad to see his Ambition thus
cross’d, gave Battel to _Castro_ in the Plain of _Chupas_; the Dispute
was long and resolute on both sides, and the Night coming on made the
Fight the more terrible, in which the Victory inclin’d to _Castro_;
however the _Almagrians_ stood to it stoutly for a great while, and that
chiefly through the valor of the Captains _Balboa_ and _Christopher
Losa_, who breaking in amongst the _Castreans_, hack’d and hew’d down
all they came near, till at last they were forc’d to betake themselves
to flight, and had not many of them exchang’d their white Scarfs with
the red of the slain _Castreans_, scarce any of them had escap’d from
being kill’d in the pursuit, and most of them that did escape were slain
the next Morning by the _Peruvians. Rodrigo Salazar, Almagro_’s Deputy,
deliver’d up his Lord to _Castro_, who condemn’d him to death, whereupon
he was immediately Beheaded with a Sword. This Battel hapned on the
twenty sixth of _September Anno 1542_. when it Froze so hard the
following Night, that most of those that were left wounded upon the
place, were frozen to death. Thus _Castro_ began his Government with
Blood, and made it his first Business to make a Discovery by several of
his Captains, whom he sent for that purpose, of the Countreys lying
Eastward from _Peru_, lying upon the great River _De la Plata_, and the
River _Marannon_, where in most places they met onely with salvage
People, and for the most part Man-eaters; and in one place where they
Landed, a great Fish resembling a Dog came ashore and kill’d several
Arm’d Soldiers. A year and a half _Castro_ had liv’d in _Cusco_, when at
the arrival of the Vice-Roy _Blascus Nunnez Vela_, all things were
turn’d topsie-turvy, he being sent thither by the Emperor _Charles_ the
Fifth, accompanied by four Councellors, _Diego Sepada_, _Lison Tejada_,
_Juan Alvarez_, and _Peter Ortiz_, to curb the _Spaniards_ Villanies and
Outrages committed against the _Peruvians_, entred _Tumbez, Anno 1544_.
where he immediately publish’d the Emperor’s Edicts, which were to this
effect:

[Sidenote: The Emperor’s Proclamation in behalf of the _Indians_.]

_All_ Peruvians _are to be releas’d from Slavery; no_ Spaniard _shall
the least oppress them, nor make use of their Service without rewarding
them for the same, nor take any Provisions of them without paying for
it_.

[Sidenote: Ill resented by the _Spaniards_.]

[Sidenote: _Pizarro_ marches against the Vice-Roy _Vela_.]

[Sidenote: _Vela_ clashing with the Commissioners, is seiz’d upon.]

[Sidenote: Being Shipt for _Spain_, is brought back by _Alvaradez_.]

[Sidenote: Is put to flight and pursu’d by _Pizarro_.]

[Sidenote: The Vice-Roy slain by _Carvayales_.]

[Sidenote: _Pizarro_’s Luxury, and Tyranny.]

[Sidenote: _Vela Nunnez_ and _La Torre_ Plotting against _Pizarro_, are
           taken and Executed.]

This Proclamation was like to put the _Spaniards_ into an uproar: for at
that time a _Peruvian_ Lord was forc’d to allow every Foot-Soldier three
Slaves, and a Horseman five, besides Hens, Rabbets, Eggs, the Wine
_Azun_, and other Provisions, for nothing. The general Complaints were,
_Is this the Reward for our Service which we have shewn to the Emperor?
Is not this mighty Kingdom of_ Peru _by our Blood and Labor joyn’d to
the Imperial Crown? Our Shoulders are grown sore under our Arms, our
Bodies made useless with Wounds, and our Limbs lame’d with Bruises. Who
shall maintain our Wives and Children, if the_ Peruvians, _who according
to the Law of Arms are become our Slaves, should not be forc’d to fish
for Pearls in the Sea, and dig us Silver out of the Mines, and do us
other Service for to maintain us?_ But _Vela_ being deaf to these
Complaints, resolv’d that the Emperor’s Commands should be fulfill’d,
and that those that spake against them should lose their Lives: and that
he might terrifie the generality with the punishment of a few, he caus’d
Fryer _Peter_ of the Order of the Virgin _Mary_ to be Executed in
_Truxillo, Castro_ to be committed to Prison at _Lima_, because he had
put _Almagro_ to death without Examination, and shut the Gates of
_Cusco_ when his Agent came before the same. But do what he could, the
_Spaniards_ generally making Head, utterly refus’d to obey the Emperor’s
Edicts, and chose _Gonsalvo Pizarro_ for their General, who rais’d five
hundred Men in compleat Arms in _Cusco_, from whence he march’d directly
with them to _Los Reyos_, under pretence to deliver a Petition there to
the Vice-Roy’s Council, about deferring to put the new Edicts in force
till the Emperor was better inform’d of the present Condition of the
_Peruvian_ State; twenty great Field-pieces being also order’d to follow
_Pizarro_’s Army, were carried by the _Peruvians_ over craggy Mountains;
to each Gun without the Carriage were order’d three hundred Men, of whom
twelve at a time carried it in their turns a hundred Paces a piece;
though several eminent Persons considering the weightiness of the
Affair, forsook _Pizarro_’s Party, and went privately to the Vice-Roy,
as on the other side, many deserting the Vice-Roy joyn’d with _Pizarro_,
who being not a little supply’d by _Peter Puelles_ Governor of
_Guanaca_, took several of those that had deserted him Prisoners, and
put them all to death, whilest the Vice-Roy made what Preparations
possibly he could, Hanging many innocent Persons onely on suspicion of
holding Correspondency with _Pizarro_, insomuch that there was no end of
Murdering on both sides. But _Vela_ clashing with his Councellors,
because they would not consent that he should ruine _Los Reyos_,
resolv’d to do it without them; and to that end to remove the Emperor’s
Seal, Staple of Trade, and Courts Judicature to _Truxillo_, and to spoil
the Countrey all about; which as he was about to put in Execution, they
privately got Captain _Martin Robles_, and _Vela_’s Lifeguard,
consisting of a hundred Men, on their side, whilest the common People
mutinying broke into the Palace, took _Vela_ and carried him to the
chief Church in _Los Reyos_, where the four Councellors were assembled,
who order’d that the Prisoner should be Shipt and sent away to _Spain_,
when _Alvares Cueto_ lying in the Harbor with ten Sail, threatned to
fall upon the Inhabitants if they would not release the Vice-Roy:
whereupon the Councellors well provided with Guns, rais’d several
Batteries against his Ships, so that _Cueto_ finding himself too weak,
set four of his Vessels on fire, and Sail’d with the rest to the Haven
_Guavara_; where being set upon by _Diego Garzias_, he was forc’d to
deliver the remaining part of his Fleet up to the Councellors, who sent
_Vela_ away with the same, under the Command of _Didaco Alvaradez_. But
_Pizarro_, who till this time had pretended that he sought nothing else
but _Vela_’s Departure, march’d close to the Walls of _Los Reyos_ with
twelve hundred Men, Hang’d three Citizens upon a Tree, requir’d the
Councellors to grant him Letters Patents, by which he might be
acknowledg’d for the Supream Governor of _Peru_, which if they refus’d,
he threatned to put all that were in the City to the Sword; and upon
Consultation it was judg’d convenient to grant his Demands, the rather,
because they had not above fifty fighting Men in the City. Mean while
_Didaco Alvaradez_ making an Agreement with the Vice-Roy, they return’d
back with their Ships, and Landed in the Haven Mouth of the River
_Tumbez_, rais’d what Forces they could possibly thereabouts, but were
forc’d to retire from thence to _Quito_, (at the same time that the
Councellor _Tejada_, being sent by _Pizarro_ to the Emperor, came to an
Anchor there) where they were courteously Entertain’d; as also in _St.
Michael_, where they got daily more and more Assistants; of which
_Pizarro_ being inform’d, went thither with five hundred Men, and
forcing the Vice-Roy to flye from thence, pursu’d him above thirty
Leagues, Hanging up all those whom he could take of his Party. After
many Rencounters and Hardships suffer’d by both Parties, _Pizarro_
exceedingly wearied, return’d to _Quito_, where he minded nothing but
all manner of Debaucheries, not in the least regarding the Vice-Roy’s
Designs, which it concern’d him to have narrowly look’d into, for he
having got five hundred Men on his side, resolv’d to venture a Battel.
It was towards Evening when the two Parties had sight of one another:
_Pizarro_ having not onely more Men, but also better Exercis’d in Arms
than the Vice-Roy, who being sensible thereof, went silently about
Midnight from his Station along a narrow by Path, so to fall behind upon
the Rere of the Enemy, who mistrusted nothing, by reason the Vice-Roy’s
Dogs kept a continual Barking in his old Station, and the _Peruvian_
Sentinels were heard calling to one another, and making great Fires all
the Night long; but because the Way was over-grown, and farther about
than it was suppos’d, the Vice-Roy finding the Night too far spent, went
back to _Quito_, out of which he Sallied as soon as he had sight of
_Pizarro_’s Forces; against whom, being clad in a white Riding Coat,
through the Slits of which appear’d a Cloth of Tissue Doublet, he came
Riding on a Bay Gelding in the Head of his Party; with which breaking in
amongst the Enemies Ranks, he made a considerable slaughter amongst
them, till _Hernand Tores_ coming near him, gave him a Blow on the Head
with a Battel-Ax, that fell’d him to the Ground, which the Lawyer
_Carvayales_ seeing, ran immediately, out of desire to revenge his
Brother’s Death, whom the Vice-Roy had murder’d, and chopp’d off his
Head. Thus _Pizarro_ being absolute Master of the Field, began to shew
his tyranny upon the Prisoners, some he took away by Poyson, others he
Executed with the Sword and Halter, others he banish’d to the remote
Countrey _Chili_, and spent his time in all manner of Vice in _Quito_;
where, amongst other leud Actions, making Love to another Man’s Wife, he
hir’d one _Vincent Paul_ to murder her Husband, which said _Vincent_ was
afterwards Hang’d at _Valladolid_ in _Spain_. The Adulteress also was
afterwards Got with Child by her own Father, and both of them put to
death for Incest and murdering of their Child. _Pizarro_ being receiv’d
as King in _Los Reyos_, grew every day more proud than other, insomuch
that his Friends themselves began to hate and envy him, and wanted onely
a convenient opportunity to rid themselves of this high-minded Tyrant. A
strange Accident, among others, had done him great hurt, had it not been
timely discover’d, _viz._ _Joan de la Torre_, a Soldier formerly
belonging to the Vice-Roy, found accidentally a Grave in the Valley
_Hica_ (which by the _Peruvians_ had been worshipp’d above two Ages
before) and in it so much Offer’d Gold and Silver as amounted to above
eighty thousand Crowns in Gold, besides many Emeraulds and _Turcoises_,
all which Treasure he was puzled how to carry away and possess securely,
partly fearing the Emperor’s Displeasure, if he should arrive thus rich
in _Spain_, the rather because he had sided with _Pizarro_, and also
knowing it was impossible to convey it on Ship-board without one or
others knowledge; at last, after many Contrivances, he judg’d it
convenient to put the Money in a small Vessel, and Sail with the same to
_Nicaragua_, there to raise Men to oppose _Pizarro_ in those Parts, that
so he might re-gain the Emperor’s Favor. This Undertaking seem’d to be
threatned by many Dangers, he not having a sufficient Spirit to Command,
or at least Experience to officiate the Place of a Captain. In the mean
time _Vela Nunnez_, Brother to the slain Vice-Roy, taken in the Battel
at _Quito_, had so much priviledge allow’d him from _Pizarro_, that he
went a Hunting, and other such Exercises, distant from the Camp, who
meeting with _La Torre_, took him in his arms, and embrac’d him with
great joy, which so wrought upon _La Torre_, that he discover’d the
Secret of his discover’d Treasure, took an Oath of him that he would be
faithful to him, and take Revenge of _Pizarro_ for all the Injuries
receiv’d from him; but before, according to their Agreement, they could
set Sail from thence, their Plot being discover’d, both _Nunnez_ and
_Torre_ were Executed, and their Riches fell into the Hands of
_Pizarro_.

[Sidenote: _Peter Gasca_ sent to settle Affairs in _Peru_.]

Whilest the _Peruvian_ Affairs were in this confusion and disorder,
_Peter Gasca_, impower’d by the Emperor _Charles_ the Fifth, arriving
there, endeavor’d to settle all things in Peace and Quiet, and sent by
_Peter Hernandes_, besides the Emperor’s Letter, another which he writ
himself to _Pizarro_, the Contents of which were to this purpose:


[Sidenote: _Gasca_’s Letter to _Pizarro_.]

  _The_ Peruvian _Soyl hath drunk up the_ Spanish _Blood long enough,
  and the ruin’d Realm gapes for Rest: The Emperor proffers Pardon for
  all past Crimes, Repeals the new Laws which the Vice-Roy_ Vela,
  _during his Government, enjoyn’d the_ Spaniards _to observe. If_
  Pizarro _aims at the general Welfare, he may easily see that Arms
  must first be laid aside, which he now depends on in vain, all his
  Associates being ready to forsake him, because no Soldier can take
  up Arms against the Emperor, without being guilty of high Treason_.


[Sidenote: _Pizarro_’s Designs against him.]

[Sidenote: His Party generally fall off to _Gasca_.]

[Sidenote: _Cusco_ taken by _Centeno_.]

_Pizarro_ confounded with this Letter, call’d a Council of War, who
differ’d very much from one another in their Votes, some judging that it
would be best privately to destroy _Gasca_, others were for an open
Engagement, but most thought of another way, _viz._ to get his Person
into their custody, and keep him under a strong Guard on the Island
_Puna_, under pretence that the _Peruvian_ Princes were sent for to come
and acknowledge him as supream Governor, which because the Cities lay so
remote one from another, could not be done in less than two years. Mean
while an Embassy was to be sent to the Court at _Madrid_, which should
enjoyn _Gasca_ to remain in _Panama_, and not offer to come to _Peru_
till such time as the Emperor commanded the same a second time at the
return of the Agents. But _Hieronimus Loaisa_, chief Bishop of _Los
Reyos_, _Thomas Martin_, Provincial of the _Dominicans_, _Gomes Solis_,
_Pizarro_’s Steward, _Laurence Aldana_, who were design’d for this
Embassy to the Emperor _Charles_, never went their Journey, but staid in
_Panama_ with _Gasca_, who had also gain’d to his Party _Peter Alfonso
Ainoiosa_, who Commanded _Pizarro_’s Fleet: _Aldana_ likewise inform’d
him of all _Pizarro_’s private Councels; whereupon _Gasca_ sent
privately for Aid to _Mexico_, _Guatimala_, _Nicaragua_, and _St.
Domingo_, and dispatch’d four Ships with three hundred Men, Commanded by
_Aldana_, from the Haven _Panama_, with Order to Land about Midnight
against the City _Los Reyos_, and so fall unawares on _Pizarro_.
_Aldana_ accordingly falling into the Bay of _Malabrige_, was reliev’d
and supply’d with Provisions by _Diego Mora_, Governor of _Truxillo_: On
the other side, the Field-Marshal _Carvayales_ being sent for by
_Pizarro_, made a pompous Entrance, with the firing of Guns and
Bonfires, into _Los Reyos_, where all Persons that seem’d to have the
least inclination for _Gasca_, were either stabb’d or poyson’d. In the
room of _Mora_, _Pizarro_ sent the Lawyer _Garcias Leon_ to be Governor
of _Truxillo_, but he being taken by _Aldana_’s Fleet, joyn’d with
_Gasca_; and thus all things began to conspire the ruine of _Pizarro_,
yet he despair’d not, but being inform’d of the approach of the Ships,
caus’d the Drums to be beaten in _Los Reyos_, forc’d every one that was
able to bear Arms, on pain of death to serve him, made several
experienc’d Soldiers, Commanders over his Horse and Foot, to whom he
gave as much Money as they requir’d, to maintain those whom they had
rais’d, and who were to be rais’d, by which means he got a thousand Men
in Arms; to which number, according to an Order sent to _Cusco_,
_Plata_, _Arequipa_, _Lima_, _Guanuco_, and other neighboring Places,
new Forces were expected to joyn; but _Savedra_, Governor of _Guanuco_,
deserting the City, left _Pizarro_ and joyn’d with _Mora_, who secur’d
the Province of _Caxamalca_ for _Gasca_. Thus _Pizarro_ began to be
daily more and more forsaken. Since the destruction of the Vice-Roy
_Vela_, Captain _Diego Centeni_ had hid himself out of fear of _Pizarro_
a whole year, in a Cave under Ground, but now inform’d of _Gasca_’s
Arrival, came forth, and getting forty Men and some Horses together,
which also belong’d formerly to the Vice-Roy, resolv’d, though meanly
Arm’d, to go upon a bold Design, _viz._ to take the City _Cusco_; of
which _Antonio de Robles_, a Man hated and despis’d for his mean Extract
and little Wit, had the chief Command, there being therein a Garrison of
five hundred Soldiers, besides the Citizens, who were likewise in Arms:
Being inform’d of _Centeno_’s approach, he sent out _Francisco Aguierre_
as a Spye to discover the Enemy; but he joyning with _Centeno_, advis’d
him to march along a By-way, and towards Night to draw up about _Cusco_,
which accordingly he did, and forcing open the Gates, rush’d in with his
Horse against the Enemy, who were drawn up in the Market-place, and
breaking through their Ranks trampled whole Companies under foot; after
which he fell in upon _Robles_, who having forgotten to give his Men the
_Word_, caus’d a great distraction; for the Men blinded by the darkness
of the Night, knew not Friend from Foe, insomuch that _Robles_’s Party
did one another more mischief than _Centeno_ did; who being thus become
Master of the City, caus’d _Robles_ to be Beheaded the next day, and
distributed a hundred thousand _Ducats_ amongst his Soldiers, and then
march’d with a hundred Men to the City _Plata_, to bring _Mendoza_,
Governor of the same, under the Emperor’s subjection; in which his
Design he likewise prov’d successful, being supply’d with a hundred and
thirty Foot, which _Lucas Martin_, had fetch’d from _Arequipa_ for the
Service of _Pizarro_, whom since he had deserted and joyn’d with
_Gasca_’s Party. Mean while the Fleet under the Command of _Aldana_
arriv’d in the Haven before _Los Reyos_, to the great terror and
amazement of the whole City; from whence _Pizarro_ marching, Encamp’d
himself with five hundred and fifty Men, so to prevent their Landing,
swearing that he would spare none whoe’re fell into his Hands, and sent
Order to _Peter Martin_, whom he had left in the City, immediately to
Hang up those which would not follow the Army, or who return’d from
thence home; to which purpose _Martin_ went from place to place with an
Executioner, and thinking him not quick enough in his Work, stabb’d many
Citizens himself: And strict Order was given by _Pizarro_ that all
Runaways should be punish’d with Death; notwithstanding all which many
of his nearest Friends daily forsook him, taking advantage of the
darkness of the Night; nay, the Soldiers themselves would at Noon-day
ride away from him, crying aloud, _Long live the Emperor, and let the
Tyrant_ Pizarro _die_: Wherefore he judg’d it most convenient to remove
to the Countrey _Nasca_: During his Journey thither, whole Troops left
him, insomuch that he scarce kept a hundred and fifty Men, and those he
fear’d every Minute would fall upon him and Murder him.

[Sidenote: _Los Reyos_ declares for the Emperor.]

[Sidenote: _Pizarro_ utterly defeated, surrenders himself into _Gasca_’s
           Power.]

[Sidenote: _Carvayales_ and _Pizarro_ both put to death by _Gasca_.]

With _Pizarro_’s departure, the whole Scene of Affairs was chang’d in
_Los Reyos_; for there the Imperial Standard was erected, the City Cryer
read the Letters of Pardon which _Gasca_ had brought with him from
_Spain_ in the corner of every Street. _Juan Palimino_ Landing with
fifty Men, receiv’d all those that had deserted _Pizarro_, whilest
_Gasca_ set Sail from _Panama_ with five hundred Men, with whom Landing
at _Truxillo_, he Encamp’d himself in the Valley _Xauxa_, whither great
multitudes flock’d from all places out of malice to _Pizarro_, who in a
short time had destroy’d above five hundred Gentlemen. But _Pizarro_
having quitted _Los Reyos_, he possess’d the City _Arequipa_, which he
found quite desolate, but meeting afterwards with the Forces Commanded
by _Juan Acosta_, of which one half were also run away, joyn’d with
them, and march’d against _Centeno_, who lay along the Lake _Titicaca_,
with whom he Engag’d in the Plain _Guarina_: _Ludovico Ribera_ Landing,
_Centeno_’s Party fir’d their Guns before the _Pizarrians_ were within
shot of him, of which _Carvayales_ making speedy use, drew up his Pieces
close before the Enemy, and made an exceeding slaughter amongst them,
killing above a hundred and fifty Men in the first Onset; the Horse
amaz’d at the sudden destruction of the Foot, fled, leaving the
remaining Foot-Soldiers open to the Enemy, who was gotten behind them
with his Musquetteers, and with his Horse before, whilest six
_Peruvians_ carried away _Centeno_ out of the Fight, he lying sick on a
Chair. _Pizarro_ thus become Victor, kill’d all he met with; of which
_Gasca_ being inform’d, resolving upon a private and sudden Revenge,
caus’d all Necessaries for War to be made ready, and march’d with a
thousand and nine hundred Men out of the Valley of _Xauxa_ to _Cusco_,
where by the Way he was supply’d with the Forces, which the experienc’d
Colonel _Peter Valdivia_ had brought from _Chili_; with which coming to
_Andagua_, he took up his Quarters there for some time, because the mild
Winter had with continual Rains made the Ways so dirty, that there was
no travelling, and had rotted their Tents and _Maiz_, and also
occasion’d the Bloody-flux amongst the Soldiers. In _March_, _Gasca_
broke up with his Camp to cross the River _Apurima_, which he found very
troublesom, because _Pizarro_ had broke down all the Bridges: But
_Gasca_ caus’d Wood and other Materials to be carried to several places,
that the Enemy should not certainly know his Intentions, and at last
march’d over deep snowy Mountains to _Cotabamba_, where suddenly he made
a Bridge, over which march’d four hundred Foot, but the Horse suffer’d
most damage; for sixty Horses loaden with Arms going to wade over, were
carried down by the Stream against sharp Rocks, by which they were
desperately gor’d in their sides, and many of them kill’d outright.
_Pizarro_ inform’d of the Enemies whole Proceedings by his Spyes, sent
_Acosta_ thither with two hundred Musquetteers, to fall upon those that
were come over, whom he finding too many, durst not venture to Engage
with them. Mean while _Gasca_’s whole Army getting over on the other
side of the River _Apurima_, march’d up a high Hill, whilest _Pizarro_
Encamp’d himself five Leagues from _Cusco_, in a Plain call’d
_Saguisagrana_, the Entrance into his Camp being fortifi’d with six
Field-Pieces, each side by a River and several Mountains, and the Rere
by a deep dry Moat: _Gasca_ stood upon a Hill and view’d the Enemy’s
whole Forces lying in the Valley, and being oppress’d with excessive
Heat, whilest his Men were so exceedingly pinch’d with Cold in the
Night, that they were scarce able to hold their Arms, according to the
strange property of the _Peruvian_ Climate; for the tops of Hills
generally Freeze, whilest the Valleys about a League from thence are
parch’d with Heat: At Break-of-day _Gasca_ descended the Hill; his Horse
being divided into two Wings, were Commanded, the left by _Juan
Savedra_, and the right by _Balthazar Castro_; _Mendoza_ led some
Dragoons, _Valdivia_ guarded the Guns, and _Gasca_ himself march’d in
the Front of the Musquetteers. On the other side, _Pizarro_ plac’d the
_Peruvians_ on his right Wing, _Cepeda_ and _Acosta_ Commanded the
Horse, _Carvayales_ and _La Torre_ the Foot, _Sebastian Vergara_ and
_Peter Soria_ guarded the Field-Pieces: But the Battel was scarce begun,
when _Cepedo_ and a great part of the Horse deserting _Pizarro_ went to
joyn with _Gasca_, and immediately after the right Wing of the
Musquetteers; at the same time _Centeno_ and _Mendoza_ fir’d amongst
_Pizarro_’s main Body, of which some ran away to _Cusco_, others with
their Colours to _Gasca_’s Army. _Pizarro_ seeing himself thus forsaken,
cry’d out, _Since all are fled to the Imperial Standard, I will also
betake my self thither, where perhaps I may find Mercy_: Whereupon
_Acosta_ answer’d, _Let us rather fall in amongst the thickest of the
Enemy, and die valiantly_: To which _Pizarro_ reply’d, _No, now I have
lost Honor and Goods, I must take care for my Soul, that that may not be
lost also_; which said, he lighted from his Horse, Caparison’d in
Silver, and deliver’d himself and his Sword into the Hands of the
Serjeant _Villavicenzo_, who found him Habited in curious Armor, a
Golden Helmet with a stately Plume of Feathers, and a Corslet incircl’d
with Emeraulds about his Neck: _Gasca_ seeing him brought before him in
this manner, said thus unto him, _Have you not order’d your Business
well, to waste so much of the Emperor’s Treasure, and shed so much
Blood, and all to confirm your self in your unlawful Usurpation of_
Peru? To which _Pizarro_ answer’d, saying, _I have spent my own Estate
in the Service of the_ Spanish _Crown, and might lawfully take upon me
the Government of_ Peru, _having with the loss of my Brother’s Life, and
the hazard of my own, discover’d the same_. _Carvayales_ escaping out of
the Fight, had hid himself in a Thicket of Canes, but being discover’d
by his own People, was by them brought before _Gasca_, who the next day
after the Battel caus’d him to be Quarter’d alive, and _Pizarro_’s Head
to be cut off in Prison; the other Prisoners were most of them kill’d in
cold Blood. _Gasca_ thus become absolute Master of _Peru_, found an
incredible Treasure left by _Pizarro_, of which he gave to every common
Soldier above six thousand _Ducats_; and with this his victorious Army
march’d to _Cusco_, where he employ’d his Executioners afresh, in
Hanging, Drawing, and the like; some that were stigmatiz’d and condemn’d
to the Galleys, accounted themselves happy that they had escap’d so.
_Gasca_, though Victor, perceiv’d no small Troubles to threaten him,
having twenty five hundred Men in Arms, of which every one for their
faithful Service judg’d that they deserv’d some Office or other, there
being then above a hundred and fifty to dispose of, _Pizarro_ having
Executed the chiefest Officers, and those that bore any Command under
him being either fled or kill’d in the last Fight: but the small number
of Officers that were wanting, was not to be compar’d to all those that
gap’d for Commissions. The Revenues, which yearly amounted to eleven
hundred thousand _Ducats_, went most of it away amongst the Officers,
the common Soldiers getting onely a small Snip out of it; wherefore many
began to murmur, and were upon the point of Mutinying, if _Cianca_, the
Judge of criminal Causes, taking the chief of them, had not punish’d
them in such a manner, that all the rest being terrifi’d, gave over
their Complaints. After _Gasca_ had spent above nine hundred thousand
_Ducats_ in the War against _Pizarro_; all which Money he took up upon
Interest, which, after having setled the Kingdom in Quietness, he paid
for the most part with the Goods taken from the Rebels. Next he made a
Law concerning the _Peruvians_ paying of Tribute, which before the
_Spaniards_ forc’d from them whensoe’re and howsoe’re they pleas’d, with
the greatest Tortures imaginable.

[Sidenote: _Peru_ Governed by Vice-Roys.]

_Gasca_ having again erected in _Los Reyos_ the high Court of
Judicature, in which sat the Imperial Judges, return’d home with an
unvaluable Mass of Treasure for _Charles_ the Fifth, and left the
_Peruvian_ Government to the Judge _Cianca_; since which time _Peru_
hath been Govern’d by Vice-Roys, the first whereof, who succeeded
_Cianca_, was _Antonio Mendoza_, and after him successively _Andreas
Hurtado Mendoza_, _Diego Valasco_, _Lopez Garcias de Castro_, _Francisco
de Toledo_, _Martin Enriques_, _Garcias Mendoza_, _Ludovico Velasco_,
and _Juan Pacheco_, under whom the _Peruvian_ Kingdom hath enjoy’d Peace
and Quiet, to the considerable enriching of the _Spanish_ Inhabitants.

Thus much of the antient Transactions in _Peru_, it will now be
requisite to give you a brief Account of the several Provinces in this
mighty Kingdom.

[Sidenote: Division of _Peru_.]

The Countrey is generally divided into three _Juridicial Resorts_, as
they call them, or Courts of Appeal, which are _Quito_, _Lima_, and
_Charcas_; but the particular Provinces, as they are commonly observ’d
by Geographers, are said to be six, _viz._ 1. _Quito._ 2. _Los Quixos._
3. _Lima._ 4. _Cusco._ 5. _Charcas._ and 6. _Collao._


                               SECT. II.
                                 Quito.

[Sidenote: Situation and Description of _Quito_.]

The first Province of _Peru_ towards the North is _Quito_, or the new
Kingdom of _Granada_, with which on that side it is bounded, having on
the West, _Mare del Zur_; on the South, _Lima_; and on the East, _Los
Quixos_. It lieth in a manner right under the _Line_, and is said to be
seventy two Leagues in length, and in some places about twenty five in
breadth.

The Winter begins here in _October_, and continues till _March_, in
which fall mighty Showers, and on the Mountains abundance of Snow, but
all the Summer long the Sun is seldom darkned with a Cloud. Many of the
Inhabitants die of a Giddiness in the Head about the beginning and end
of Summer. The _POX_ also destroys many of the Natives; with which
Disease they are often born, and give it to the _Spaniards_, who are not
able to abstain from the _Indian_ Women; they use _Sassaparilla_ and the
Wood _Guaiacum_ to cure themselves with.

Here grow also many poysonous Herbs, which the _Peruvians_ make use of
to poyson one another.

[Sidenote: The Fruit _Quaba_.]

In the farthest parts of _Quito_ grows the salt and cooling Fruit
_Quaba_, two Handfuls long, cover’d with a grey Rind, and within full of
white Pulp and hard Kernels.

[Sidenote: The Tree _Guaiaba_.]

The Tree _Guaiaba_ hath a pale smooth Bark, thick Boughs, hard and
glittering Leaves, Flowers consisting of five Leaves, not unlike a
Peacock’s Plume, long Apples, woolly without, and within full of a pale
red Pulp and eatable Stones; the Root, which spreads it self very much,
is sweet, and when boyl’d cures the Bloody-flux. This Tree grows in most
places, especially in low Grounds, the more because the Kernels which
the Birds picking out let fall on the Ground, spring up in new Trees.

The _Spanish_ Fruits, as Peaches, Cittrons, Figs, Pomegranates, Pears,
Quinces, and Oranges, grow also here in great abundance, but when ripe
are subject to rot.

Moreover, the Fields abound with Wheat, Barley, and _Maiz_; the Pastures
afford plenty of Grass for Oxen, Horses and Sheep, which bring forth
Lambs twice in fourteen Moneths.

The Ocean and Rivers store of Fish; the Stream _Barbara_ us’d formerly
to produce Gold also.

In moist Grounds the Inhabitants find abundance of Salt-petre, the best
that is for the making of Gun-powder.

[Sidenote: The Inns _Tambos_.]

For the Accommodation of Travellers, Inns call’d _Tambos_, are built
near the High-ways, exactly five Leagues distant one from another, where
all sorts of Provisions are sold at a set Price.

[Sidenote: The Nature of the People.]

The Natives antiently went Cloth’d in a Frock without Sleeves, as wide
on the top as at the bottom, and pleited their long Hair. They are
strong, well proportion’d in Body, and subtile enough to learn any Art,
but treacherous, inconstant, and inclin’d to Drunkenness: They were very
hard also to be brought to receive the _Roman_ Religion, so that most of
them would not suffer themselves to be Baptiz’d till they lay a dying:
They also drove a great Trade in Cotton, Wooll, and Cloth.

Between _Pasto_ and _Quito_ are several Villages, and the famous
High-way, by the _Ingas_ cut through the Wildernesses and Mountains, the
Wall of an old Castle, and the wonderful Stone-Bridge _Lumichaca_, which
Nature hath made over the swift River _Guaca_; it consists of a hard
Cliff, at the Foot whereof is a great Arch, through which the Water runs
with exceeding force.

[Illustration]

This Tract of Land produces _Maiz_, and abundance of _Mortuanos_, a
Fruit resembling Damask Prunes, which eaten in excess cause Drunkenness
and Faintness.

The Lake _Yaguarcocha_, signifying _Bloody-Water_, because the Inga
_Guayanacava_ kill’d and drown’d twenty thousand there.

[Sidenote: Towns and Places of chief note.]

The chief Towns and Places of Note are, 1. _Caranguez_, antiently a
Royal City, where stood a sumptuous and stately Palace of the Kings of
_Peru_, now almost deserted. The Palace, built of Stone in a little
Plain, without either Mortar or Iron-work, manifests its former glory by
its Ruines.

2. The Royal Castle of _Atabalo_, or _Ottavallis_, in the building of
which the _Ingas_ spar’d no Cost nor Charges; and indeed it is a
Structure no way inferior to any of the antient _Roman_ Edifices.
Between this Castle and _Cochequi_, a stately House, lies a cold snowy
Mountain. Moreover, the _Spaniards_ have several Habitations along the
Way to _Quito_, and especially in the Valley _Annaquito_, where the
Vice-Roy _Vela_ lost the Battel fought against _Gonsalvo Pizarro_.

3. _Quito_, commonly call’d _St. Francisco de Quito_. There stood
formerly here certain Palaces, built by the _Ingas_, but the City was
re-built by the _Spaniards_ at the Foot of a certain Ridge of Mountains,
which it hath on the North and North-West side of it, and are said by
_Laet_, to cross the whole Countrey of _Peru_ quite over from the South
to the North Sea: It was soon after the Building inhabited by five
hundred Families of _Spaniards_ at least, besides Natives, and well
fortifi’d, and might be thought a Town very well seated in all respects,
but for the neighborhood of a Vulcan, which at times annoyeth it very
much, as namely in the Year 1560. when it vomited out such abundance of
flaming Cinders and other sulphureous Matter, that had it not been for a
Shower of Rain unexpectedly falling, would have much damnifi’d, if not
destroy’d the Place. The Natives about _Quito_ are more Moraliz’d than
other _Peruvians_. The Valleys which are warm’d by the Sun produce all
manner of Fruit-Trees and large Vineyards; and the Root _Papas_, not
unlike Apples. The _Quimla_, which is of a Mans heighth, hath little
Seeds, of which a pleasant Liquor is boyl’d. From _Quito_ the High-way
leads to _Cusco_, along which at every four Leagues distance stands a
brave Palace; and from _Cusco_ to _Chili_, being in all above a thousand
Leagues long. The City, built on a sandy Soyl, is divided in the middle
by a Moat, over which lead several Bridges: the Streets are large and
streight, and full of handsom Houses, and at the ends of the four chief
Streets four Market-places. Besides the Cathedral, are two other
Churches, Dedicated to the Saints _Sebastian_ and _Blasius_. The
Cloysters of the _Franciscans_ and _Dominicans_ are also no small
Ornament to the City. Besides other stately Structures, are the
Residences of the Receivers of the Kings Revenues, to which the
_Peruvians_ that live about the City, being computed no less than fifty
thousand in number, pay Tribute; and to keep them in subjection, the
City _Quito_ is always well stor’d with all manner of Ammunition and
Instruments of War. The chiefest Trade here consists in Sheep, Goats,
and other Cattel, Cotton-Clothes, Cloth, Flax, Hats, Cordage, Sugar and
Salt; which Salt, being grey and bitter, springs out of a Fountain in
the Countrey _Mira_. The Oyl, Wine, and Drugs which are us’d here, are
fetch’d from the South Sea up the River _Ambato_, and from thence with
Carts into the City.

4. _Thomebamba_, famous for a Royal Palace, built there by some of the
_Ingas_; It lies Southward from _Quito_ in the Province of _Canares_,
where two Rivers commix their Waters, near a Plain abounding with
Venison. There yet remain considerable Ruines of this Palace, in which
one may discern the vast Dimensions of divers Rooms, in some of which
Arms were kept, and in others Provisions and Clothes; of which kind of
Buildings or Magazines the _Ingas_ had erected above a thousand in
_Peru_, especially along the High-way, that they might have their
Ammunition ready in all places if need should require. On the left side
of _Thomebamba_ appear’d the famous Temple of the Sun, whose Gates were
not onely curiously Painted, but also Inlay’d with Emeraulds. Both the
Palace and Temple, adorn’d with Gold and costly Images of great
Touch-stone and Jasper, contain’d within their Walls an unvaluable
Treasure. These magnificent Structures are at this day fall’n quite to
decay. The People of this Countrey, who wear long Hair, pleited on the
top of their Heads like a Coronet, go Cloth’d in Cotton Coats and
Buskins of Hair-cloth. The Women, indifferent fair, and great admirers
of the _Spaniards_, Plough, Sowe, and gather in the Harvest, whilest the
Men stay at home, Spinning, Weaving, and doing of other Female-Offices.
_Anno 1544._ they discover’d Mines here, which produc’d as much Gold as
Earth.

5. _Tacunga_, where was formerly another stately Palace, about fifteen
Leagues from _Cusco_, not far from the Mountain which some years since
vomited Ashes and Stones into the adjacent Fields. Hereabouts was
formerly a Cloyster, inhabited by the Nuns call’d _Namaconas_, the
Ruines whereof are yet to be seen, with several Houses of Stone, but
cover’d with Thatch. The Natives in this Place are of a brown
Complexion, and of a very affable Nature.

6. _Mulambato_; 7. _Mocha_; 8. _Rhiobamba_, three small Villages, but
each of them credited with a stately Palace. Opposite to _Rhiobamba_
lies the Province _Chumbo_, from which a troublesom Way leads to
_Guaynacapa_ over the River _Chongo_.

9. _St. Jago de Puerto Viejo_, giving Denomination to the Territory
about it, which produces abundance of _Potatoe_ Roots, _Maiz_, _Juca_,
three sorts of _Guayavas_, _Cerezillas_, and the Tree _Tunas_, which
bears wild Figs. The _Spanish_ Fruits grow here likewise in great
plenty. The fore-mention’d Beasts like Hogs, whose Navels grow on their
Backs, are also very common here. The Woods abound with Deer and all
sorts of Fowls, amongst which one resembling a Goose, and call’d _Xuta_;
and another nam’d _Maca_, somewhat lesser than a Cock, and which feeding
about the House, may be reckon’d amongst the Poultrey of this Countrey.
The Sea along the Coast affords them abundance of _Bonito_’s, which
eaten in some Seasons cause Agues. The People along the Sea-Coast are
generally troubled with Pimples and Sores in their Faces, especially on
their Foreheads and Noses, few of them living long, by reason of the
unhealthfulness of the Place through excessive Moisture, for the Rain
continues eight Moneths together.

10. _Manta_, lying upon the Southern Ocean, the chief of the Villages,
formerly possess’d by the _Caranes_, betwixt the Promontory _Passao_ and
the River _Dable_. These People are said to this day to carve and cut
their Faces from their Ears to their Chins; about their Necks and Arms
they wear Chains of Gold and little red Corals, call’d _Chaquina_,
highly esteem’d by the _Peruvians_. This Town was formerly famous for a
great Emerauld, which was religiously worshipp’d there.

11. _Guayaquil_, otherwise call’d _Culata_, built at a deep Inlet of the
Sea, near the River _Anebato_, which with great swiftness falls down
from the Mountains _Quito_, is surrounded with a fertile Soyl; and in
the hollow Trees is found plenty of Honey. The Water of the
fore-mention’d River, being of great vertue in curing the _Morbus
Gallicus_, hath great resort of People from all places; who likewise
gather the _Sarsaparilla_ that grows along the Banks. The Bridge which
the Inga _Guaynacava_ began to lay cross this River, is also very
remarkable, but he dying, it was left unfinish’d. The _Guancabilcas_
were heretofore under the Jurisdiction of this City _Guayaquil_.

12. _Castro_, so call’d from a strong Fort built there by a _Spanish_
Captain, and situate in the Valley _Vili_, not far from _Guayaquil_.

13. The City _Loxa_, built in the Countrey of the _Paltas_, a People
that went naked, between two Arms of the River _Catamayo_ under a
wholsom Climate, near the High-way that leads to _Cusco_ in the Valley
_Curibamba_, where no poysonous Beast was ever found. The Soil bears
abundance of Oaks, Hazles, Ash, Willow, and Cedar-Trees; _Maiz_, Barley,
and Wheat. Not far from the City springs a hot and sulphurous Fountain,
which cures all sorts of Sores and Wounds. The Countrey hereabouts is
likewise stor’d with Fowls, Venison, Cattel, and Fish. Moreover, the
City receives no small lustre from two _Dominican_, and one _Franciscan_
Cloyster. Eastward from which lie desolate Mountains, whose tops are
continually cover’d with Snow. Not far from hence were formerly two
noble Palaces, _Piedras_ and _Tamboblanco_, besides several Villages.

14. _Cuenca_, wherein are also large Structures for the Monks and
Priests: The Countrey about the same hath rich Mines of Gold, Silver,
Quicksilver, Copper, Iron, and Sulphur.

15. _Zamora_, Eastward from the cold Mountains _Andes_, built in a
Marshy Soyl, where the Inhabitants are never visited with Pestilential
Distempers, and use no other Physick for such Sicknesses as they are
troubled with, than Tobacco, and the Herb _Aquacolla_. But there is a
certain Nut that grows hereabouts, which occasions sudden death, if
eaten raw, but being boyl’d, is a wholsom Food. The Mines afford great
pieces of Gold, of which one weighing eighteen Pound, was presented to
_Philip_ the Second, King of _Spain_. The briny Springs produce good
Salt. Three Rivers falling from the Mountains, are noted for their
Golden Sands, and also afford delicious Fish. The Bees being here void
of Stings, furnish the Inhabitants with plenty of Honey. The Tygers and
little Lyons devour many of the Sheep _Pacos_, Goats, Hogs, and other
Cattel, and sometimes the Natives themselves. The City it self is neatly
built with Woodden and Stone Houses, and adorn’d with a Church and
_Dominican_ Cloyster, besides a stately Palace, the Residence for the
King’s Receiver. The Natives about this Place are a stupid and barbarous
People, which before the _Spaniards_ coming thither, would for a small
trifle kill one another.

[Illustration: EXPUGNATIO PAYTÆ]

16. The City _Yaen_, situate in the Countrey _Chuiquimayo_; it is so
call’d from a swift River, cross which the _Peruvian_ Women and Children
swim, to the great amazement of the _Spaniards_. They paint their Bodies
black with the Juice of the Root _Yaguas_, and feed for the most part on
the stamp’d Plant _Yaca_. On the other side of the Mountain, which rises
on the Banks of _Chuquimayo_, lies the Countrey _Perico_, fruitful and
well inhabited, against which juts the Golden Countrey _Cherinos_.
_Peru_ hath also several delightful Valleys, amongst which on the North
the chiefest are the _Tumbez_, _Solana_, _Poechos_, and _Piura_, all of
them very fertile, full of stately Buildings, and water’d by several
Rivers.

17. _San Miguel_, the first City that was built by the _Spaniards_ in
_Peru_, situate in a sandy and dry Soyl, being extraordinary dusty in
Summer, and very slabby in the Winter, because the hard Ground cannot
soak up the Rain. The _Ingas_ made a Way through this Valley fifteen
Foot broad, between two Walls, and Planted Trees on each side.

[Sidenote: _Spilbergen_’s Attempt upon _Payta_.]

18. Westward from _Miguel_ appears _Payta_, near a convenient Haven in
the South-Sea, which _Anno 1547._ was burnt by _Thomas Candish_; since
which it had been re-built twenty eight years, when _Joris Spilbergen_,
after a hard Engagement with the _Spanish_ Admiral _Rodrigo Mendoza_,
arriving in the large Haven before _Payta_, sent eight Sail with three
hundred Armed Men up to the City, where finding the Enemy Encamp’d along
the Shore, he return’d without any effect; but two of his Frigats, the
_Eolus_ and the _Morning-Star_, running close to _Payta_, fir’d whole
Broad-sides at the same, whilest Captain _De Wit_ took a _Peruvian_
Fisher-man, who had been two Moneths out at Sea, and taken abundance of
Fish. The Guns which the Ships fir’d upon the Town struck such a terror
into the Citizens, that they fled with Bag and Baggage into the
Mountains, and left the City for a Prize to _Spilbergen_, who setting
fire on the same, in few hours burnt down two Churches, a _Dominican_
Cloyster, and several Alms-houses: But had not the Citizens been
cowardly, they might easily have kept off the _Hollanders_; for the
Vice-Roy _Ludovico Velasco_ inform’d of _Spilbergen_’s Arrival, had
stor’d the Place with Ammunition and Men, whose Courage failing, prov’d
successful for the _Hollanders_, who whilest they Rid here at an Anchor,
took a very strange Bird on the Island _Lobos_, lying before _Payta_,
being two Yards high and three thick, in its Bill, Wings, and Claws
resembling an Eagle, and having a large Crest on its Head. Not long
after _Donna Paula_ being Governess of _Payta_, a Lady famous in _Peru_
for her Beauty and obliging Nature, sent Cabbages, Oranges, Cittrons,
and other Provisions to the _Hollanders_, and requested the Releasement
of some of the _Spaniards_ taken in the Engagement against _Mendoza_,
but could not obtain her Request from the uncourtly _Dutchmen_.


                               SECT. III.
                              Los Quixos.

[Sidenote: Description of _Los Quixos_.]

The Province of _Los Quixos_ lieth South, and to the South-East of
_Quito_, being border’d more directly Eastward with a part of the
Province of _Guiana_, call’d by some _El Dorada_, or _The Golden
Countrey_; on the South it hath _Lima_ and _Cusco_.

[Sidenote: The _Canela_-Fruit.]

This Province is subdivided into several lesser Territories, _viz._
_Canela_, _Pacomores_, and _St. Juan de Salinas_. _Canela_ is so call’d,
because it hath many great Woods, which produce the Fruit _Canela_ in
great abundance, the Owners whereof were most inhumanely dealt with by
the _Spaniards_; for _Gonsalvo Pizarro_ supposing to get store of Gold
there, found nothing but Trees, bearing a Fruit like Olives, by the
Natives call’d _Canela_, with which they us’d to drive a great Trade,
being otherwise poor and simple People, living in Huts, which _Pizarro_
pulling down, caus’d the Inhabitants to be torn in pieces by his Dogs,
because they could not furnish him with Gold, nor direct him where it
was to be had.

[Sidenote: The _Granadilla_-Apple.]

Besides the _Canela_-Tree, this Countrey also produceth in great plenty
the Tree which beareth the Apples _Granadilla_, exceeding good against
burning Feavers; the Leaves are like Ivy, the Blossom resembling the
Sun, and the long Leaves speckled with Red and White, open three hours
after Sun-rising, and close again before the Evening, just as if Nature
took care to preserve the beauty of the Flower.

[Sidenote: Towns and Places of chief note.]

In this part of the Province the chief are, 1. _Baeza_, otherwise call’d
_Quixos_, built in the Year 1559. by _Ramires de Avila_, eighteen
Leagues from _Cusco_.

2. _Archidona_, twenty Leagues to the South-East of _Baeza_. 3. _Avila._
4. _Sevilla del Oro_, all of them _Spanish_ Colonies.

The Territories _Pacomores_ and _Yguansongo_, otherwise call’d _The
Countrey of Juan de Salinas_, are said both to extend above a hundred
Leagues in length, and little less in breadth. The Fields afford store
of Pasture for Cattel, the Plough’d Lands produce Wheat and all sorts of
wholsom Herbs; and in some places are also rich Gold-Mines.

The Governor _Layola_ built four Towns here, _viz._ 1. _Valladolid_; 2.
_Loyola_; 3. _San Jago de los Montanas_; and 4. _Caruma_.

The Jesuit _Acosta_ relates, That not far from _Caruma_ he found great
Stones, some of which were full of Golden Veins, but were hard to be cut
from the Rock. Most of the Gold is found in the Sand of several Rivers,
the chiefest whereof flow through _Quito_, _New Granada_, _Valdivia_ in
_Chili_, and _Caravaya_ in _Peru_.

On the Point of _Quito_, the River _San Jago_ falls into the Southern
Ocean; the Ground in the Mouth of the River being very uneven, for
oftentimes the Ships are fast aground at the Stern, and on Head they
have above eighty Fathom Water; yet nevertheless the Shoals are no ways
dangerous.

South-West from _St. Jago_ lies the spacious Inlet _Mattheo_, and the
Promontory _Francisco_, known by its Banks and high Grounds, which shew
red and white at a great distance.

Not far from hence, exactly under the _Equinox_, appears _Cape Passao_,
flat and low; between which and _Mattheo_, the great Rivers _Los
Quiximes_ fall into the Sea.

Behind _Passao_ rises the high Mountain _Quaque_; and more Westerly the
Bay _Caraques_ affords a secure Harbor for all manner of Vessels.

Next you come to the Town _Puerto Viejo_ before mention’d, lying behind
the Island _Laurenso_.

Five Leagues off at Sea, before _Laurenzo_, lies the Island _Plata_,
formerly famous for a _Peruvian_ Temple, in which the Natives Sacrifis’d
Sheep, and sometimes Children, and painted the Figures of divers Persons
with the Blood; to which they also Offer’d Jewels, Gold, Silver, Wooll,
Cotton Shirts, and Cloaks. _Francisco Pizarro_ arriving here, got an
invaluable Mass of Treasure; but at present it lying desolate, affords
nothing but Brambles and wild Trees.

The next which come in view are the Havens _Callo_ and _Zalango_, where
there are safe Harbors, good Wood and Water.

The Cape of _St. Helena_ makes also a secure Road on the North, and on
its Shore hath a Spring, on the top of whose Waters swims a certain Gum,
by the Natives call’d _Copey_, exceeding good to make Ships tight.

The River _Tumbez_ falls into a large Bay, which on its North-East Point
near the Main Land, hath the Island _Puna_, ten Leagues in
circumference: The Soyl whereof produces abundance of _Maiz_, _Fuca_,
and other good Roots, besides great Woods full of fruitful Trees, and
_Sarsaparilla_. The Inhabitants of a brown Complexion, and middle
Stature, wear Cotton Cloaks, and Chains of _Chaquira_ and Precious
Stones: They drive a great Trade, and formerly maintain’d Wars with the
People inhabiting upon the River _Tumbez_; their great want is fresh
Water in the Summer. _Thomas Candish_ Landing here _Anno 1587._ found a
Ship hal’d ashore, and three Villages, in one of which stood a Palace
belonging to a _Casique_, surrounded with Stone Galleries; and near it a
large Store-house full of Tar-pots and Hemp to make Cables of: The
Village consisted of two hundred Houses, and a fair Church with a
Steeple, in which hung several Bells. The _Casique_ Married to a
_Spanish_ Woman being fled with the Villagers, _Candish_ took many Oxen,
fat Sheep, Pigeons and Ducks, the Bells, and what else was not convey’d
aboard, with him, and, afterwards burnt the whole Town; but whilest he
was busie in making havock, a thousand _Spaniards_, and a considerable
number of _Peruvians_ fell upon the _English_ on such a sudden, that
they kill’d some, and took others Prisoners.

Somewhat farther off at Sea appears the Isle _Clara_, where those of
_Puna_ formerly buried their Dead.

The Inlet into which falls the River _Tumbez_, whose Shores are well
inhabited, ends Westward at the Promontory _Blanco_; Southward from
which lies the Isle _Lobos_, where there are several Springs full of the
same Gum, or _Bitumen_, a little above mention’d.

Beyond the Point _Agua_ lie the two Isles _Lobos Marinos_, opposite to a
low Coast; they are desolate, and barren of Grass, Trees, and all kind
of Herbs, and destitute of fresh Water; but many Pelicans, Penguins, and
other strange Birds.

The discovering of these Coasts belonging to the Jurisdiction of
_Quito_, deserves a short Relation:

[Sidenote: _Bevalcazar_ overcoming _Ruminagua_, takes _Quito_.]

[Sidenote: He comes to an Agreement with _Alvarado_.]

[Sidenote: _Pizarro_ and his Army driven to great Straights.]

[Sidenote: _Orellana_ cross’d in his Designs, dies for grief.]

[Sidenote: The miserable Condition of _Pizarro_’s Men.]

[Sidenote: _Quito_ very much defac’d by siding with _Vela_ against
           _Gonsalvo Pizarro_.]

Whilest _Pizarro_ kept the Inga _Attabaliba_ Prisoner, he sent Captain
_Bevalcazar_ to the new Fort _St. Miguel_, where eighty Horse and a
hundred Foot being arriv’d from _Panama_ and _Nicaragua_, and he being
inform’d that there lay a great Treasure in _Quito_, and that the
_Canares_, the _Spaniards_ Friends, were exceedingly oppress’d by
_Ruminagua_, _Attabaliba_’s General, immediately march’d thither with
the new arriv’d Forces before mention’d, to fetch the Booty, and to
assist the _Canares_; but several things oppos’d him in his Design: for
_Ruminagua_ guarded the Way with twelve hundred _Indians_, digg’d Pits
in the same, and filling them with sharp Poles, cover’d them slightly
over with Canes and Earth; all which _Bevalcazar_ shunning, went about,
fell in upon the Rere of the Enemy, and after a small Resistance
conquer’d the City _Quito_. Mean while _Ferdinand Cortesio_ sent _Petro
Alvarado_ from _New Spain_, who taking _Guatimala_, receiv’d a
Commission from the _Spanish_ Court, to subdue the Northern parts of
_Peru_. Soon after which _Garcias Holgua_ being sent with two Ships to
enquire concerning the State of _Peru_, brought News back, That
_Francisco Pizarro_ had gotten an unvaluable Treasure at _Caxamalca_;
which so stirr’d up _Alvarado_, that he Landed five hundred Men at
_Puerto Viejo_, march’d in great want of Provisions over the Mountains
_Acabucos_, and had he not accidentally found a Pond of sweet Water in a
Thicket of Canes, both Men and Horses had all perish’d; at last upon his
approaching _Quito_, the Governor thereof, being _Bevalcazar_, not
enduring to suffer an Equal, drew up all his Men in Battel array; but
some Persons interceding between them, they were soon reconcil’d, and
_Alvarado_ being bought out with a great sum of Money, deserted _Quito_;
where after _Gonsalvo Pizarro_, had remain’d a considerable time he
march’d Eastward of the Province, which produces abundance of Cinamon;
whither he was accompanied by two hundred _Spaniards_ and four thousand
_Peruvians_; against whom the Natives dwelling on the Borders of _Los
Quixos_ fought very valiantly, till Night approaching, when they all ran
away; after which resting a while, there arose a mighty Tempest of
Thunder and Lightning, accompanied with a dreadful Earthquake, which
swallow’d above five hundred Houses, whole Woods and Fields, whilest an
unknown River burst out of the Earth, and overflow’d all the Countrey,
insomuch that _Pizarro_ expected nothing but a speedy Ruine, in regard
no Provisions were to be found in all the Countrey: at last getting on
the top of the nearest Mountain he lost many of his Men, who were frozen
to death with excessive Cold. From thence marching to the County
_Zumaque_, he got plenty of Provision and Cinamon, which grows on great
Trees in the Woods; the Leaves thereof resemble the Laurel; the Fruit
grows in little Berries; the Root and Bark have a strong odoriferous
smell. Thence travelling to the Town _Coca_, he found a mighty Cataract
of Water, falling from a Rock above fifteen hundred Ells high; insomuch
that the noise in calm Weather was heard six Leagues off. _Pizarro_
leaving his sick People in _Zumaque_, went onely with a few Eastward
from _Coca_ to the Plain Countrey _Guema_, full of Moorish Grounds, the
Inhabitants whereof went naked: at last he came to the great River
_Maranon_, which falls from the Mountains near _Quito_, and extends with
several windings above eight hundred Leagues in length, and at the Mouth
thereof is fifteen Leagues broad, which at that time overflowing all the
Countrey, he judg’d it convenient to build a Brigantine, making the
Shoes of the dead Horses serve for Iron-work, his Mens Shirts for Sails,
and a Gum, which was to be had there, for Tar, and having Lanch’d their
Vessel, and put all their Baggage and sick People into the same, they
Sail’d close along the Shore, on which _Pizarro_ made his Way through
Brambles and Canes, or went over in the Brigantine whensoe’re he espy’d
a better Path on the other side; in which manner they were gone two
hundred Leagues down the River, with no other Food but wild Fruit and
Roots; when Captain _Franciscus Orellana_, was order’d to Sail away
before with five Men, and seek out for Provisions, and at every Stream
which fell cross-ways out of the Countrey into the great River, he was
to leave a Mann’d Boat: but _Orellana_ in few days drove down so far
with the swift River, that he saw no likelihood of getting up again in a
whole year, neither could he find any Provisions, but fought daily with
the _Indians_, who came stoutly to Board him in little Boats: amongst
whom he was inform’d also, that thereabouts liv’d the _Amazon_ Women,
that Warr’d continually against their Neighbors; and at last he came
into the Northern Ocean. But _Orellana_ Sailing to _Spain_, obtain’d a
Commission to be Governor of the _Amazons_ Countrey, whither he steer’d
his Course with five hundred Men in three Ships; but Landing at the
_Canaries_ they all ran away from him, which so incens’d _Orellana_,
that he soon after dy’d with Grief. Mean while _Pizarro_ inform’d by a
_Spaniard_ whom _Orellana_ had put ashore, that the Brigantine was by
the strong Current carried into the Ocean, knew not what to do, his
People since their departure from _Quito_ having travell’d above four
hundred Leagues, had eaten most of their Horses: Many dy’d by feeding on
unwholsom Herbs; others fell down dead for Hunger, or tir’d out with
toilsom Travel; their Clothes, rotted by the Rain, hung upon them like
Rags, their Shoes were worn out, their Feet full of Blisters, their
Bodies sadly mangled with Brambles and Thorns, for no place afforded
them a Boat. _Pizarro_ leaving the River _Maranon_, went another Way, no
less troublesom for steep Rocks and inaccessible Mountains. The Valleys
through which they went, began now to be strew’d with dead and sick
Bodies, who were not able to follow the Army, which march’d very fast,
every one judging to be so much nearer his preservation the farther he
could get: Those that fainted call’d continually on their Friends for
help, but the Horses were grown too weak to carry them: Every one saw
nothing but Death before his Eyes; wherefore, though call’d by their
dearest and most intimate Friends that lay a dying, they never look’d
back, their compassion towards others being turn’d into fear and care of
themselves. The Forsaken implor’d their Saints, and besought _Pizarro_
for aid, but finding their Complaints to be in vain, and raging through
despair, they wish’d all the rest the same success, and the like
Friends, whenever they should be in the like Condition. _Pizarro_
extreamly griev’d and troubled, that he had brought the People into this
Misery, sent a few Horsemen before to _Quito_, to carry the sad News of
his deplorable Condition, that they might immediately send Provisions to
him; which he receiving when he was within fifty Leagues from the said
City _Quito_, distributed amongst those that were left alive, who being
also almost starv’d, eat so greedily, that several of them were chok’d;
the remainder were kept a considerable time in Garrison under the
Command of _Pizarro_ in _Quito_. Which City, built in a pleasant place,
grew very populous in the Year 1544. there being several Gold-Mines
found about the same in that time. But this lasted not long, for _Quito_
siding with the Vice-Roy _Blasco Nunnez Vela_ against _Gonsalvo
Pizarro_, most of the Citizens were destroy’d by him, and their Houses
burnt to Ashes. The like Destruction, and upon the same occasion, befel
the three Villages in the Province _Bracomoros_, discover’d by _Juan
Parzel_ and Captain _Vergara_, together with the Countrey
_Chichiapoios_, where _Alphonso Alvarado_ built the Town _Levanto_,
surrounded with deep Caverns, through which, to the great strengthning
of the City, flow several Rivers.

Round about _Puerto Viejo_ the Natives dwelt in Trees, whom the
_Spaniards_ had much ado to bring under their subjection; for their
Countrey being barren and mountainous, was not onely wanting in
Provisions to feed an Army, but the _Peruvians_ also threw great Stones
out of their Huts built in Trees, and likewise Javelins and Pots full of
boyling Water, with which they did much mischief to their Enemies that
Storm’d them, who at last covering themselves with Boards, cut down the
Trees, with which they falling were torn in pieces by the _Spanish_
Dogs.


                               SECT. IV.
                                 Lima.

[Sidenote: Situation and Description of the Province of _Lima_.]

_Lima_, call’d also _Los Reyos_, hath on the East, _Collao_, and some
part of _Cusco_; on the North, _Los Quixos_; and on the South,
_Charcas_. The Countrey extendeth it self in length upon the Coasts of
the South Sea two hundred and fifty, some say, full three hundred
Leagues in length, _viz._ from _Cape del Aguia_ Northward, on the
Borders of _Quito_ as far as _Arequipa_ towards the South, and runs
Eastward to _Brasile_ and _Rio de la Palma_.

[Sidenote: The several Valleys of this Province.]

In this Province are several very pleasant Valleys, the first whereof is
_Motupe_, to which a sandy Way leads from _St. Miguel de Valverde_,
between barren Wilds, from whence several Streams falling are
immediately drunk up by the Sand; wherefore all Travellers that go that
way carry Water and Wine with them in _Calabashes_ for twenty Leagues
together, which they Walk or Ride by Night, because of the excessive
heat of the Sun.

In the Valley _Motupe_ grow abundance of Trees, which receive
nourishment from a River that springs up near the same. Here is also
much Cotton.

Not far from hence are the Valleys _Xayanca_, formerly very populous and
full of Palaces: The River which flows through the middle is led in
Trenches amongst the neighboring Fields.

The Valley _Tuqueme_ is also very pleasant, and the decay’d Palaces,
sufficiently testifie its former splendor.

The next being _Cinto_, is no way inferior to _Tuqueme_; and between
both lie sandy Hills and barren Rocks, on which grow neither Trees nor
Herbs, nor is any living Creature to be found upon them: the Way through
which being a whole days Journey, cannot be travell’d without sure
Guides.

The Valley _Collique_, water’d by a River of the same Denomination, and
very thick set with Trees, was formerly very populous, but since the
_Spanish_ Wars it is become quite desolate; for not onely a considerable
number of them were slain by the _Spaniards_, but also many destroy’d
themselves, Wives and Children; of which _Peter Martyr_, Councellor to
the Emperor _Charles_ the Fifth, sets down several terrible Examples, of
which two were remarkable above the rest; the first was after this
manner:

[Sidenote: Two tragical Passages.]

The _Spanish_ Captain _Olandus_ Lying with the Daughter of an _Indian
Casique_, question’d when she grew big with Child, Whether she was with
Child by him? and that he might know the real truth by Torture, he
caus’d her to be ty’d naked to a woodden Spit, and laid to roast against
a Fire made of green Wood, so that she died in a most miserable manner;
upon which her Father ran in a rage with thirty of his Companions to
_Olandus_’s House, where he kill’d his whole Family, and locking all the
Doors about the House, set fire on the same, into which when it was at
its greatest heighth, he and his Associates leap’d into the middle
thereof.

The second Accident is also very terrible, _viz._ An _Indian_ Maid being
Got with Child by a _Spanish_ Ass-driver, acquainted her Father and
Mother with it, withal telling them that she was ready to suffer Death
for her Offence; and notwithstanding they freely pardoning, and
perswading her to the contrary, she eat raw _Juca_, which when boyl’d is
a wholsom Food, but if eaten raw, certain though languishing Death;
which she perceiving, ran to the next River, where after having wash’d
her self, she broke off from a large Tree a Bough of five Foot long, and
making the end thereof very sharp, fell upon the same, and so kill’d her
self. Several other Ravish’d Maids taking example hereby, hang’d
themselves upon the Boughs of the same Tree.

But to proceed in our Description, next to _Collique_ lies the Valley
_Zana_, of the like bigness, and famous for the City _Miraflores_.

The next is _Pascayamo_, which exceeds all the former in fruitfulness,
and populousness of Inhabitants, who before they were destroy’d by the
_Ingas_ were much fear’d by their Neighbors. This Valley also was
adorn’d with several fair Temples, which are now turn’d into Cloysters.
Cattel, Hogs, and Goats breed here in very great numbers. The chief
Trade of this Place consists in Cotton and Linnen.

The Valley _Chacama_, in which the _Dominican_ Monks inhabit a brave
Cloyster, produces abundance of Sugar.

Four Leagues farther lies the spacious Valley _Chimo_, so call’d from an
old _Peruvian_ Heroe, which affords a pleasant Prospect, by reason of
the many Banquetting-houses built there by the _Ingas_. No place in
_Peru_ is able to stand in competition with this for plenty of
Provisions, the Ocean and Rivers producing store of Fish, the Countrey
affording Cattel and all manner of Fruit. The Cotton which grows here is
Shipp’d to the South Sea.

_Chanca_ is a Valley chiefly considerable for the Town _Arnedo_, which
is situate therein, of which more hereafter.

But the Valley _Guanape_, not far from _Chanca_, yields the best
_Peruvian_ Liquor _Chica_, and hath a convenient Harbor for Ships.

The Plain _Santa_ being overflow’d in the Winter, is all overgrown for
want of Inhabitants, who were all destroy’d by the _Spaniards_. The
Woods hereabouts swarm with a sort of venomous Bug, which exceedingly
torments the Traveller.

[Sidenote: _Spilbergen_’s Attempt.]

Next follow in order the Valleys _Guambaico_, very fruitful, and
_Guarney_, abounding with Horses, Hogs, and other Cattel. _Joris
Spilbergen_ Landing here _Anno 1615._ found the Haven secure against all
Winds, and between the Shore and the Village _Guarmey_ a Creek, and
somewhat farther a fresh-Water Pool; on one side of which stood a
decay’d Castle built of square Stone, whereon the _Hollanders_ set the
_States_ Flag, and Garrison’d the same to secure those that fetch’d
Water out of the foremention’d Pool. In the aforesaid Village stood a
Church with a spiry Steeple; behind which rose high Mountains, and at
the Foot thereof a great Wood, into which the Inhabitants fled with all
their Goods, so that _Spilbergen_ found nothing but a little Meal, a few
Hens, Hogs, and Oranges in their Houses, which whilest he was sending
Aboard, a small Body of Horse appear’d, but immediately fled into the
Woods. The _Hollanders_ staying here seven days, were inform’d, that the
Galley _Jesu Maria_, Commanded by the Admiral _Rodrigo Mendoza_, and the
_Santa Anna_, by the Vice-Admiral _Peter Alvares Piger_, were both lost,
not one Man being sav’d.

Not far from thence lies the Valley _Parmonga_, which though it be
fruitful and pleasant, yet it is quite desolate; the Walls of a large
Castle still appear, as testimonies of its being formerly inhabited; and
within the said Walls also are still to be seen the Ruines of spacious
Halls and fair Chambers, whose Walls are painted with wild Beasts and
Birds: The _Spaniards_ have digg’d all about, and undermin’d the same,
in hopes to find, together with the several dead Bodies, a Treasure
buried. Two Leagues Southward from this Valley _Parmonga_ flows the
River, _Guayman_, by the _Spaniards_ call’d _Rio del Falcon_, from a
Hawk which was seen there. When any store of Rain falls here, a great
part of the Dale _Barrana_ lies under Water.

[Illustration: GUARME]

[Sidenote: Strange manner of Hunting.]

Not far from hence lie the Valleys _Gaura_ and _Lima_; which last
exceeds all others in bigness, and was formerly exceeding populous; but
since the Marquess _Pizarro_ built the City _Los Reyos_ here, the
Citizens have taken the Lands from the _Peruvians_. The Mines hereabouts
produce Gold and Silver. Amongst other things the Inhabitants highly
esteem an Herb bearing yellow Flowers, which in a short time cures a
putrifi’d Wound, whereas if laid on sound Flesh it eats the same to the
Bone. The Natives heretofore us’d to spend their time in Hunting, and
caught their Game after this manner, _viz._ three or four thousand of
them would meet together, and by taking Hands make a Ring of three or
four Miles in circumference, and at a certain Note or Tune Sung, or
loudly Exclaim’d, they drew nearer and nearer, till at last they were
within Shot of the inclosed Game, whatsoever it were.

[Sidenote: A vast Treasure found by _Ferdinando Pizarro_.]

The Countrey of _Collao_ hath a low Point, from which a long Cliff runs
into the Sea, towards the small Island call’d _Isla de Collao_: On each
side of the Point the Coast runs sloaping in, the one side extending
North-West from _Collao_, to the Cliffs _Piscadores_; the other
South-East to the second Promontory; behind which is a large Bay, where
the Valley _Pachacama_ appears, famous for its exceeding fruitfulness,
and a stately Temple built by the _Ingas_, where _Ferdinando Pizarro_
found above nine hundred thousand _Ducats_, besides what the Soldiers
and Commanders took, and what the Priests had hid, which none, though
miserably tortur’d, would confess.

Opposite to _Pachacama_ lies the Valley _Chilca_, where it never Rains,
nor any Brook or Spring moistens the dry Soil, which nevertheless
produces _Maiz_ and Fruit-Trees. The Natives us’d to dig large and deep
Pits, in which they Sow’d and Planted, and at every Root laid the Head
of a Fish call’d a _Sardin_, which they caught in Nets on the Sea-shore;
wherein nevertheless nothing would have grown, but for the Morning Dews
which fell. The _Ingas_ also had curious Banquetting-houses here. In
these Parts there grows a sort of Tree call’d _Mala_, of which _Acosta_
relates a strange Wonder of Nature, very remarkable, _viz._ That it
flourishes and bears Fruit on that side which beholds the South, in that
Season when it is Summer on the Mountains; the other which views the
Sea, Blossoming and bearing Fruit when it is Summer on the Plains.

The Valley _Guarco_, spacious and full of Trees, produces especially the
pleasant Fruit _Guayaves_ and _Guavas_, as also the best Wheat in
_Peru_; wherefore it is vended all over the Countrey. Here are also the
Ruines of another stately Castle, built by the _Ingas_, the former
lustre whereof is testifi’d by its remaining Walls, which consist of
exceeding great Stones, so neatly joyn’d together without Mortar, that
it appears like one entire Stone; and by the decay’d Structures of
several Halls, much of the curious Painting whereof is yet to be seen;
from the Castle a large pair of Stairs led down to the Sea-shore. Two
Leagues farther the River _Lunagun_ runs through the fertile Valley of
the same Denomination. The fatness of this Soil is chiefly ascrib’d to
the Dung of a Fowl call’d _Guana_, which the Natives fetch in great
abundance from the Isles near the Main.

Next follows the Valley _Chinca_, one of the biggest in all _Peru_, and
before the _Spaniards_ Arrival very populous. In the time of the _Ingas_
it also shew’d a magnificent Temple Dedicated to the Sun, built by
_Tepaja Jupangue_; yet the Inhabitants still remain’d constant in the
worshipping of their old Idol _Cinciapema_. Hither the _Ingas_ sent
their conquer’d Princes, who on a certain time were to appear in
_Cusco_. The _Dominicans_ at present possess here a neat Cloyster, from
whence leads a plain Road to the Dale _Ica_, water’d by the River
_Pisco_, which is dry in Summer; wherefore the Natives brought a Ditch
from the Mountains, which since the _Spaniards_ destroying the
Inhabitants, is choak’d up with Sand.

Next the Valley _Nasca_ comes in view, famous for the Castle
_Caxamalca_, where the _Ingas_ kept all manner of Ammunition for War,
besides several Tombs, out of which the _Spaniards_ took great Riches.
This Valley is divided into several others, which for the most part
produce Sugar-Canes; and through them all runs the Royal High-way, which
is Wall’d in on both sides.

Beyond _Nasca_ lie one behind another the Valleys _Hacari_, _Oconna_,
_Camana_, and _Quilca_, all of them affording good Pasture for Cattel,
and Fruit, yet are most of them desolate.

The County _Los Motilonos_, thinly inhabited for want of Provisions, and
divided by two Rivers, separates _Moyobamba_ from the Countrey
_Charasmal_.

Southward beyond _Caxamalca_ appear the Countreys _Guamachuco_, and a
little farther _Conchucos_ and _Piscobamba_, all fruitful and pleasant,
and adorn’d with several Structures built by the _Ingas_.

On the side of _Piscobamba_ the County _Guaraz_ extends it self over
barren Mountains, through which the _Ingas_ cut a Royal High-way, and
built a strong Castle at the Entrance into the Countrey; the Inhabitants
whereof being very laborious, work very diligently in the Gold-Mines.

The Territory _Pincos_, water’d by a River, and famous for one of the
stateliest of the _Peruvian_ Structures, is surrounded by the Countreys
_Guayalcas_, _Turama_, _Bomba_, and _Conchucos_. The Mountains, though
dangerous to Travellers by Lyons, great Bears, and other ravenous
Beasts, afford abundance of Silver; and the fruitful Soil produces
Wheat, _Maiz_, Grapes, Figs, Oranges, Quinces, Cittrons, Cedars, and;
likewise feeds Goats, Horses, and other Cattel.

The Countrey _Viticos_, being within the Jurisdiction of _Guanuco_, lies
amongst the Mountains _Andes_, whether _Inga Mango_ fled, when the
_Spaniards_ made themselves Masters of _Peru_.

[Sidenote: Chief Towns and Places of note.]

The Towns and Places most observable and important in it belonging to
the _Spaniards_, are 1. _Miraflores_, as the _Spaniards_ call it, a well
seated and wealthy Town in the Valley of _Zanu_, as above mention’d,
five Leagues distant from the Sea, where it hath likewise a good Haven
or Port.

2. _Truxillo_, two or three Leagues distant from the Sea; the Haven
whereof is said to be large, but not safe. The Town it self is seated in
the Valley _Chinco_, upon the Banks of a pleasant River, whose Water
doth not onely run through several Channels to moisten the Fields, but
also to accommodate every House in the City: It hath broad Streets, a
great Market-place, four Cloysters, two for the _Dominicans_, one for
the _Augustines_, and the other for the _Franciscans_; one great Church,
five hundred Houses, and a Palace, inhabited by the King’s Collectors,
and many Banquetting-houses about it. The good situation and
fruitfulness of the Soil, mov’d the Marquess _Francisco Pizarro_ to
build this City here _Anno 1533._ but the Haven belonging to the same
lies open to all manner of Winds, so that the Ships Ride here in great
danger.

3. _La Parilla_, otherwise call’d _Santa_, fourteen Leagues beyond
_Truxillo_ Southward, wash’d by the Southern Ocean, and one side by a
fresh-water Stream, which being inclos’d between stony Cliffs, makes a
secure Harbor.

4. _Arnedo_, seated ten Leagues Northward from _Lima_, amongst the
Vineyards of the Valley _Chancas_; otherwise having no great matter in
it remarkable, but a fair _Dominican_ Cloyster.

[Sidenote: Prizes taken here by Sir _Fran. Drake_.]

[Sidenote: _Spilbergen_ attempts the Place in vain.]

5. _Lima_, by the _Spaniards_ commonly call’d _La Cividad de los Reyes_,
or _The City of Kings_, so nam’d because _Pizarro_, who built it, laid
the first Stone on _Twelfth-day, Anno 1553._ which they call _The Feast
of the Kings_: It is seated in the Valley of _Lima_, (from whence the
City is also so denominated) one of the fruitfullest Parts of all
_Peru_, and so neatly built, that all the chief Streets of the City open
upon a fair Market-place, or _Piazza_, of such a large Square, that upon
the sides thereof are built, in a stately and convenient manner, the
Cathedral, the Palace of the Archbishop, the Vice-Roy’s Palace and
Courts of Justice, with the Exchequer or Publick Treasury, the
Town-house or place where the City Magistrates meet and hold their
Courts, the Publick Armory or Magazine, and a Free-School, wherein are
taught by the _Jesuits_ all Arts and Sciences, and also the _Indian_
Language, and divers other fair Buildings of the Nobility and better
sort of Citizens. No Countrey under the Heavens affords a more fruitful
or pleasanter Place than this; the temperate Climate neither troubling
the Inhabitants with excessive Heats or great Colds, nor terrifying them
with Thunder or Lightning, but having almost perpetual Sun-shine and
fair Weather; onely the three Winter Moneths, wherein there falls a
sweet-smelling Dew, which cures the Head-ache; and there die but very
few of pestilential Distempers. The Countrey about the City is pleasant
without exception. The Pigeons which are kept here in curious Houses
built on purpose, flie a thousand in a Flight. The Fields abound also
with Cattel. The Orchards and Gardens flourish with all sorts of Trees
and Plants, whereof those that are brought hither from _Spain_ grow
better than in their natural Countrey. The West side of the City is
wash’d by a pure & clear Stream, which stores the Market with great
plenty of good Fish, it being distant but a Musquet shot, especially
when the Water rises. This River is of great consequence, for it not
onely waters the whole Valley of _Lima_ with its several Branches, but
also runs under every House in the City, being built on Stone Arches;
they are onely one Story high, because there is no Wood to be had in the
Valley of _Lima_ but what in three years becomes all Woorm-eaten;
nevertheless the Houses are very beautiful both within and without; the
Walls being very thick and strong, have curious Arbors of green Boughs
on the top, in which the Owners shade themselves from the Sun. Most of
the Houses built in the high Streets have pleasant Turrets, which face
the Market-place, where all sorts of Provisions are brought to Sale, as
Oxen, Sheep, Venison, Sugar, Oranges, Cittrons, Grapes, and Wheat, which
is ground in Water-Mills built near the River. This City is inhabited by
many able Merchants, which often load Ships to _Panama_, that are valu’d
at above two hundred thousand _Ducats_. To the Arch-bishop’s See of this
Place belongs the Bishopricks of _Chili_, _Charcas_, _Quito_, _Cusco_,
_Truxillo_, _Guanuco_, _Popaian_, _San Francisco_, _Panama_,
_Nicaragua_, and _Rio de la Plata_. The City is also adorn’d with two
fair Churches, besides the Cathedral, and also other lesser Churches,
four stately Cloysters, two Nunneries, and the _Jesuits_ Palace, which
is very magnificent. The Haven two Leagues distant from it, and call’d
_Callao de Lima_, is large and secure for Ships. _Anno 1579._ Sir
_Francis Drake_ took twelve Ships from hence, one whereof was laden with
Linnen and Silk, besides a great Chest full of Silver: Which
Inconvenience to prevent for the future, the _Spaniards_ have built two
strong Forts, and fortifi’d them with Brass Guns. Thirty years after Sir
_Francis Drake_’s Exploit, _Joris Spilbergen_ coming to Anchor here,
found the Place all inhabited, a Fort well stor’d with Guns, and a
strong Castle before the Mouth of the Harbor, from whence they shot
Bullets of thirty six Pound weight at the _Hollanders_, and so shatter’d
their Frigat, call’d _The Hunter_, that she could scarce keep above
Water: Fourteen _Spanish_ Merchant-men lying near the Shore, receiv’d
little damage, _Spilbergen_ not being able for Shelves to get to them,
neither did he judge it convenient to Land, the Vice-Roy having at that
time above four thousand Men in Arms, besides several Troops of Horse;
wherefore after having fir’d several Guns on the Fort, and against the
Church, he set Sail to _Guarmey_.

6. _Cannete_, otherwise call’d _Guarco_, from the Valley wherein it is
situate: It was built by the _Spaniards_ out of the Treasure which they
found in the Castle afore spoken of in the same Valley.

7. _Valverde_, situate in a Valley of the same Name, where excellent
Fruit may be had for a small Price; it is a well Traded and rich Town,
about sixteen Leagues distant from the Sea.

8. _Pachacama_, situate in a Territory of the same Name, four Leagues
Southward of _Lima_, memorable chiefly for _Pizarro_’s good fortune
here, who is reported to have found in one onely old Temple of the
Natives, the quantity of nine hundred thousand _Ducats_ of Gold and
Silver, besides what his Soldiers are suppos’d to have seiz’d on, and
convey’d away before he came.

9. _Castro Verreina_, threescore Leagues distant from _Lima_ to the
South-East: It lieth in the Valley of _Chocolocha_, and is a rich Place,
by reason of the good Mines of Silver which are about it, and abundance
of the best sort of Tobacco.

10. _Miguel de la Ribera_, in the Valley of _Camana_. The Inhabitants
whereof drive a great Trade in Wine, Figs, and Raisins.

11. The City _Arequipa_, which extends up towards the Mountains, is
built in the Dale _Quilca_, which runs eleven Leagues from the Sea,
under a healthful Climate; but in the Year 1582. it was wholly ruin’d by
an Earthquake; the reason whereof is ascrib’d to the wet sulphurous
Mountains, which burns continually, and sometimes vomits out Flames and
Ashes. The Marquess _Pizarro_ built this City forty six years before the
fore-mention’d Earthquake, since which being re-built again, soon
attain’d to three hundred Houses, besides a Church and Cloyster; and
though it be but a small Town, yet it is of a great resort, because the
Gold and Silver is brought hither from the Mines _Chancos_, _Porco_, and
_Potosi_, and from thence sent down the River _Quilca_, which washing
the City Walls runs into the South Sea to _Los Reyos_, and from thence
to _Panama_, _Nombre de Dios_, and _New Spain_. The Jurisdiction of this
City _Arequipa_ extends it self a vast way, _viz._ over the spacious
Valleys between _Hacari_ and _Tampaca_, and up in the Countrey beyond
the County _Condesuyo_, full of Hamlets and Villages; the Inhabitants
whereof heretofore worshipp’d the Sun. By the Way from _Arequipa_ to
_Collao_ lie two great Lakes, out of one of which the River _Aparima_
takes its original.

12. _Caxamalca_, rather a Fort than a Town, in a Territory of the same
Denomination, built at the Foot of a Mountain wash’d with two Rivulets,
over which lead several Bridges; near which also were formerly a stately
Temple Consecrated to the Sun, wonderful Palaces and Baths for the
_Ingas_, besides other magnificent Structures of Noble-men, which were
the more famous for _Attabaliba_’s Imprisonment and Death. The Soil
round about may compare with any part of the World for fertility. The
Inhabitants are a peaceable ingenious People, and make curious woollen
Hangings.

13. _St. Juan de la Frontera_, built by the _Spaniards_ North-East and
by East from _Caxamalca_ in the County _Chiachinpoyas_, full of
Gold-Mines and Cattel; to which belongs not onely _Chiachinpoyas_, but
also the Countreys _Guiancas_ and _Cascainga_, out of which above twenty
thousand _Peruvians_ pay Tribute to the _Spanish_ King. These People
especially the Women, are very comely and beautiful; for which reason
the _Ingas_ fetch’d their Wives and Concubines from thence. Eastward
from _Frontera_ rise the high Mountains _Andes_, behind which flows the
great River _Mayobamba_ by several poor Villages inhabited by a sottish
kind of People.

14. _San Jago de las Valles_, built in an ill place amongst the Shrubs
and overflowing Rivers. In this Countrey grows a Tree which bears a
juicy Fruit, not unlike an Almond in prickly Rinds, but resembling those
which cover a Chesnut, concerning which Physicians have deliver’d their
Opinions, That there is not a wholsomer Fruit in the whole World.

15. _Leon de Guanuco_, which receiv’d that Denomination from its Builder
_Vacca de Castro_, who call’d it _Leon_, because he was born in the
_Spanish_ City _Leon_, and _Guanuco_ from the stately Palace of the
_Ingas_ which was built here: The Houses are built of Free-stone, and
cover’d with Thatch. The Citizens of _Los Reyos_ were much against the
building of this Town, because several Lands belonging to them were
taken away and given to _Guanuco_, where the temperate Air grants long
Life and Health to the Inhabitants. The High-way, in which stand several
Store-houses, formerly full of Ammunition, runs through the middle of
this Countrey, where in the time of the _Ingas_ dwelt Astronomers, who
by looking on the Stars pretended to tell future Events. Here the Women
also us’d to be burnt alive with their Husbands.


                                SECT. V.
                                 Cusco.

[Sidenote: Situation and Description of _Cusco_.]

_Cusco_ is the far greater part of the Province of _Peru_, containing
generally all the _Sierra_, or _Hill-Countreys_, and those parts of the
_Andes_ likewise which lie Southward of the little Province or _Cantred_
of _Guanuco_, being Coasted Westward and to the North-West with _Lima_;
Eastward, with _Los Quixos_, and some part of _Guiana_; and on the
South, with _Charcas_; enjoying for the most part a temperate and good
Air, neither over-heated with the scorching Sun in the day, nor damp’d
with any cold Mists or Dews in the Evening, as some parts of the Plains
of _Peru_ are, but well water’d with many fresh Rivers, which make the
Valleys and lower Grounds of it good Pasturage, able to maintain great
Herds of Cattel. The Woods are especially stor’d with the _Coca_, whose
Leaf is accounted restorative, and with much excellent Venison.

[Illustration: CUSCO]

[Sidenote: The several Valleys, and other Territories belonging to
           _Collao_.]

In this Province also there are some lesser Divisions of Countreys
necessary to be describ’d, _viz._ the cold and barren Countrey _Bambon_,
jutting against _Guanuco_, inhabited antiently by a valiant People,
especially near the Lake _Chincacocha_, which is ten Leagues in
circumference; in the middle of it are several Cliffs and little Isles:
And out of this Lake also the famous River _De la Plata_ hath its
original, and runs through the Valley _Xauxa_, receiving by the way the
Streams _Parcos_, _Bilcas_, _Abancay_, _Apurima_, _Yucay_, and others.

The next Countreys in order towards the South are _Tarana_, abounding
with Wheat, and the eminent Valley _Xauxa_, surrounded with snowy
Mountains. The Inhabitants by a general Name call’d _Guancas_, were
antiently divided into three sorts, _viz._ the _Maracabilca_,
_Laxapalanga_, and _Xauxa_. Here were also several stately Houses built
by the _Ingas_.

Upon this Valley borders the Village _Acos_ near a Moorish place full of
Canes; but before you approach the Village you come near a high Plain,
where the Ruines of an antient Structure appear; and somewhat farther
the Palace _Pico_: from whence the High-way directs to the Bridge
_Angoyaca_, which leads cross the River _Xauxa_; near which the _Ingas_
had several magnificent Structures, and Baths of warm Springs. Not far
from hence is the Village _Picoy_; between which and _Angoyaca_ the Arm
of the River _Xauxa_ is cut with a Bridge, because in the Winter it
glides so swift that they cannot Ferry over it.

From _Picoy_ you go to the Wild, in whose Center stands the antient
Castle _Pucara_, (which in the _Peruvian_ Tongue signifies _Invincible
Fort_) where the _Ingas_ receiv’d their Tribute from the neighboring
People that live amongst the snowy Mountains.

The Banks of the great River _Vinaque_ are crown’d with the Ruines of
antient Structures, which (as the Natives relate) were built by foreign
People; which Assertion of theirs seems to be confirm’d by the form and
manner of Building, differing from the _Ingas_ Structures, which us’d to
be long and narrow. Moreover, several sweet Streams, abounding with
Fish, especially Crabs, glide through the Plain-Countrey out of the
Mountains _Andes_.

Not far from hence appears the Plain _Chapas_, and the Palaces _Pilcas_,
of which now nothing remains but a heap of Rubbish, which lies in the
Center of _Peru_. A fresh-water River, which gives the fore-mention’d
Palaces their Denomination, glides out of _Soras_, and washes the
High-way and stately Temple of the Sun.

The Countrey _Soras_, exceeding fertile, and stock’d with Gold and
Silver Mines, is inhabited by a People which go Cloth’d in woollen
Cloth, and for their Valor formerly much esteem’d by the _Ingas_.

Those that inhabit the Countrey _Uramar_ are call’d _Chancas_, whose
Neighbors possess a long Tract of Land abounding with Cattel and Fruit,
but of late are most of them destroy’d by the _Spaniards_.

The River _Abanca_, which takes its original in the Mountainous County
_Parinacocha_, washes several Royal Buildings, and at last discharges
its Waters into the River _Xauxa_.

On each side of the great River _Apurima_ are erected two wonderful
Stone Pillars, over which lies a most artificial Bridge built by the
_Ingas_; from whence the Highway, being cut through hard Rocks, leads up
into the Countrey; where the stately Buildings of _Limatambo_ shew
themselves; and beyond the Mountain _Bilcaconga_ the Valley
_Xaquixaguana_, inclos’d between high Rocks, comes in view, where the
_Ingas_ us’d to recreate themselves in their Banquetting-houses; from
whence the Highway, which is Wall’d in on both sides, runs directly
through deep Moorish Grounds to _Cusco_.

[Sidenote: _Peter Anzurez_ his Journey.]

Eastward from _Cusco_, behind the _Andes_, are many large Countreys,
which to discover the _Spaniards_ spar’d neither trouble, danger, nor
charge: between both they found vast Wildernesses, inaccessible
Mountains, and overgrown Countreys; yet at last they opened four ways
thither: the first whereof runs through the Valley _Paquil_ to _Tono_, a
Village in the middle of the Mountains; from thence to the River
_Opotazi_, along which it is very troublesom travelling, because of the
thick Woods and steep Rocks: lastly to the hot and fruitful Valley
_Abisca_, and so to vast Wildernesses, overgrown with Brambles and
Bushes, which prevented any farther Discovery. The second Way runs
thirty Leagues farther to the Southward, through the Countreys _Sandia_,
_Camata_ and _Caravaya_, to _Zama_. Through this Way, _Anno 1538. Peter
Anzurez_ travell’d; setting out from _Zama_, he found many desolate
Mountains, barren Wilds, and close Woods, through which he entred into
the County _Tacana_, and from thence to the River _Omapalchas_,
inhabited on both sides by the _Cheriabones_ and _Marquires_, who
oppos’d him in his crossing over the River; but meeting with nothing but
barren Commons, he travell’d up along the River, and view’d the
Countreys _Moios_, _Cochabamba_, and _Chuguiabo_, from whence he
return’d to _Collao_, having lost most of his People by Hunger and
Hardship. But not long after others went over the _Andes_ to the
Countreys which extend themselves East and West, some whereof travell’d
through _Camata_, and others through _Cochabamba_.

[Sidenote: Towns and Places of note.]

The principal Towns and Places of Trade in it are, 1. _Bombon_, situate
upon the Lake _Chinchacocha_, said to be ten Leagues in compass, begirt
round about almost with Hills, and having neighborhood with many other
lesser, but pleasant Villages.

2. _Parcos_, once a Palace Royal of the _Ingas_, seated on the top of a
little Hill, encompass’d with other Rocky and higher Mountains on all
sides.

3. _San Juan de Vittoria_, which the Marquess _Pizarro_ built _Anno
1539._ to secure the Way between _Lima_ and _Cusco_, from the Assaults
of the _Peruvians_, before he absolutely conquer’d this Kingdom: the
Walls are wash’d by a sweet Stream, to the great convenience of the
Citizens.

4. _Guamanga_, a City lying in a pleasant Plain under a healthful
Climate, built with Stone-houses cover’d with Tyles; the Owners whereof
have great store of Land, which they Sowe with Wheat, and also breed
plenty of Cattel. To this City, which is adorn’d with three Churches,
five Cloysters, and a large Almshouse, above thirty thousand _Peruvians_
bring annual Tribute. The Mines produce Gold, Silver, Copper, Iron,
Lead, Sulphur, and Load-stones; near which grows the poysonous Herb
_Mio_, which kills the Cattel that chance to eat thereof. In the Woods
also hereabouts feeds a Beast, whose Piss stinks at a Miles distance.
This City is by some deliver’d to be the same with _San Juan de la
Vittoria_ above mention’d.

5. _Bilcas_, another Palace of the _Ingas_, now a good Town of the
Natives, and situate, as is suppos’d, in the very midst of the Countrey
of _Peru_.

6. _Guancavelica_, a new Town, rais’d from the condition of a very poor
Village, to a Place of very great Importance and Traffick, onely by the
Mines of Quicksilver, which were first discover’d there in the Year
1566. by _Amador Cabrera_, through the assistance of a _Peruvian_ nam’d
_Mavincopa_: This _Cabrera_ selling his Interest for a hundred and fifty
thousand _Ducats_, Su’d the Buyer, upon pretence that he had sold it
above one half under the value: whilest this was depending, _Peter
Ferdinando de Valasco_ came from _Mexico_ to _Guamanga_, to make trial
of the cleansing of Silver by Quicksilver, and finding it to succeed
according to his expectation, he sent great quantities of it to _Arica_,
and from thence by Land to _Potosi_. The King of _Spain_ is said to
receive from this Mine of _Guancavelica_, all his Charges defray’d,
above a thousand Pound _per Annum_ for his usual fifth part: But the
antient Natives regarded not these Mines so much for the Quicksilver as
for the Vermilion which is found mix’d with it, wherewith they delighted
very much to paint their Bodies: There is great Art now us’d in the
separating of the Quicksilver from the Vermilion.

This Town was long since inhabited by two thousand _Spaniards_ at least,
and twice as many Natives.

[Sidenote: The original of the City _Cusco_.]

7. _Cusco_, which is the Metropolis of the Kingdom of _Peru_, built on a
hard Ground, surrounded with Mountains, under a cold, yet wholsom
Climate, and wash’d by two Rivers, which on the East side of _Cusco_
parting, one runs direct West, and the other Southward. One part of the
City antiently bore the Denomination of _Haran-Cusco_, and the second,
_Oren-Cusco_, where the chief Nobility and most antient Families dwelt.
Concerning the original of this Place, the _Peruvians_ say, That several
Ages past there appear’d three Men, call’d _Ayrache_, _Aranca_, and
_Ajarmango_, and with them three Women, nam’d _Mamacola_, _Mamacona_,
and _Mamaragua_, all of them very richly Cloth’d; that _Ayrache_ had a
Precious Stone at the end of a Truncheon, which by holding up he rais’d
the Mountains to the Skies, and when he let it fall, levell’d them with
the lowest Valleys: _Aranca_ and _Ajarmango_ concluded to build a
stately City, and sent for People from remote Countries to inhabit it;
with which Design the Natives thereabouts seem’d to be well pleas’d: but
before they went to work they judg’d it convenient to destroy _Ayrache_,
whose great Power they envy’d: This being resolv’d upon, they invited
him to a deep narrow-mouth’d Cave, that there they might worship the Sun
his Father (for so Descended he took upon him to be), he was no sooner
entred but the rest shut the Mouth of the Cave with great Stones, hoping
so to starve him to death; which _Ayrache_ observing, stood amaz’d a
while, till at last he threw off all the Stones, and flew with great and
divers colour’d Wings up into the Air, crying aloud, _Fear not_, Aranca
_and_ Ajarmango, _though you have design’d to take away my Life, but
build a City in this place, and call it_ Cusco; _for in it shall stand
the Seat of the_ Ingas, _under whose Jurisdiction extending far and
near, many great Nations shall bow. The Temple which the Gods have there
design’d shall not onely exceed all other Structures in the World, in
Art and Costliness, but be famous for strange Offerings to the Sun. If
the Citizens build Altars for me, burn Myrrh, and make Offerings to me,
they may certainly expect to vanquish all their Enemies, and increase
their Power. According to my Example bore Holes through your Ears, as a
sign of Obedience._ All which _Aranca_, _Ajarmango_, and the
fore-mention’d Women promis’d to perform. Whereupon _Ayrache_ gave them
a rich Diadem with a Tassel, which was to be the Head-Ornament of the
succeeding _Ingas_; which they had no sooner receiv’d, but _Ayrache_ and
_Aranca_ were turn’d into Stones, yet retaining their former shape;
which _Ajarmango_ observing, fell straight, together with the three
Women, upon building the City _Cusco_. After the Deluge breaking out of
the Hole _Tambo_, he chang’d his Name of _Ajarmango_ for _Mangocapa_,
that is, _Mighty Lord_, and made himself, as they say, the first
_Peruvian_ King. The City _Cusco_ was divided into four Wards, the East
call’d _Andosayo_, the South _Callasayo_ the North, _Chinchasuyo_, and
the West _Condesayo_, every one so call’d from the Countreys, to which
the Gates of the four Wards are oppos’d.

If any one coming out of another Countrey, setled himself in _Cusco_, as
it hapned daily, he was permitted to dwell no where but in that Ward
which fronted his native Countrey. The four high Streets, which through
these Wards one way fall into the Market-place, being in the middle of
the City, are the other way answerable to the four principal High-ways,
_viz._ that which leads to _Quito_ and _Pasto_, through _Chinchasuyo_;
to _Arehuipa_, through _Condesuyo_; to the Mountains _Andes_, through
_Andesuyo_; and to _Chili_, through _Collasuyo_. The two Rivers before
mention’d, which part at the East end of the City, are pass’d over with
divers Bridges. The narrow Streets are full of Stone Houses, built in
good Order. In several places are Vaulted Cellars under Ground, in some
of which are buried great Treasures: they had been formerly the
Habitations for Necromancers and Soothsayers; for this sort of People
were once in great esteem amongst the Inhabitants, who coming from
_Chili_, _Pasto_, _Bocamores_, _Topona_, _Bombon_, _Charcas_, _Collao_,
_Chiachiapoias_, _Conchucos_, and other _Peruvian_ Countreys, receive
great benefit from the fresh Water, and from the Corn-Mills built on the
Streets through the City.

[Sidenote: The antient Palaces and other stately Structures in _Cusco_.]

The stately Palaces which the _Peruvian_ Nobility have at several times
built in _Oren-Cusco_, being one part of the City, are very wonderful,
the Owners whereof were forc’d by the _Ingas_ to appear at Court at
Set-times, that so he might prevent all Insurrections: Also he caus’d
the Children of the prime Lords to be brought up in _Cusco_, under
pretence that they might learn the _Cuscoan_ Tongue perfectly, in which
the _Ingas_ would always be spoken to; whenas their Design was to keep
them as Hostages in their own Jurisdictions, that their Fathers might
not rebel; by which means it hapned, that in most places of _Peru_,
which amongst the several Tribes and Principalities had several
Languages, the _Cuscoan_ Tongue was understood and spoken. But the
_Spaniards_, who are the present Possessors thereof, have alter’d and
repair’d most of the ordinary Houses, which are now neatly built of
Stone. Above all the old Structures, the Palace of the _Ingas_, and the
Temple of the Sun, are the most magnificent; the Palace lies inclos’d
within a square quadruple Wall, each corner whereof is adorn’d and
strengthned with a Tower: The Palace it self is built round, and with
Arches; but that which chiefly amazes the Beholder, is to see how the
Stones, which are so big that forty Horses are not able to stir one of
them out of its place, were brought thither by the Labor of the Builders
from the neighboring Mountains; for the _Peruvians_ never made use of
any laboring Beast, except their Sheep _Pacos_, not knowing the use of
Horses, Camels, Oxen, Elephants, or the like, before the _Spaniards_
coming thither. The Halls within the Palace were Wainscoted with Golden
Plates: yet the _Inga_’s Apparel was not answerable to the rest of his
Pomp; for in stead of a Crown they bound their Heads about with a red
woollen Sash, with which they almost cover’d their Eyes; at the end of
the Sash hung certain Ribbands, which they gave the Governor as occasion
offer’d, that by this Sign, as by a Commission, they might exercise
their Offices; the sight of which String caus’d such Obedience, that if
the _Inga_ had commanded the Inhabitants of a Town or Countrey to murder
themselves, none durst deny. The _Inga_ was generally carried by a
hundred of his Noble-men, of whom if any one had accidentally chanc’d to
stumble, he was immediately put to death. No man durst presume to look
him in the Face, or speak to him without a Present.

[Sidenote: The Temple _Curicanche_.]

[Sidenote: A cruel Battel between two Brothers.]

The Temple _Curicanche_, Dedicated to the Sun, was certainly the most
rich and sumptuous that ever the World boasted, it being Govern’d by the
Chief Priest _Villanoa_. The Inga _Guainacava_ spent an invaluable
Treasure in the building of this Structure, for he cover’d the Roof and
Walls with thick Plates of massie Gold and Silver. At his return home
from the Conquest of the Province of _Quito_, from whence the
Inhabitants, according to an antient Custom of the _Ingas_, were carried
to one of the remotest Countreys in _Peru_. But _Guainacava_ enamor’d of
a _Quitoan_ Maid, staid a considerable time in the City _Quito_, and
kept a splendid Wedding at the Marriage of his Bride, who bare unto him
the famous _Attabaliba_, whom he lov’d beyond all his other Children,
and a little before his death made him King of _Quito_. But _Huascar_
after _Guainacava_’s Decease would not suffer his Brother to live in the
late conquer’d Kingdom of _Quito_, but gave him Battel in the Plain of
_Tomebamba_, which lasted three days and three Nights, and after much
Blood-shed, _Attabaliba_ being defeated was taken Prisoner, and not long
after making his Escape by the help of an antient Woman (whilest
_Huascar_’s Commanders and Soldiers rejoyc’d with Cups full of _Chica_
for their gotten Victory) he made his Subjects in _Quito_ believe, that
he being transform’d into a Serpent, crept through a little Hole out of
the Prison; and that he had a Promise from Heaven to obtain Conquest
over _Huascar_; which being believ’d, stirr’d up all his Subjects to
take up Arms, and valiantly to go and meet the Enemy, whom they not
onely defeated, but took _Huascar_ Prisoner.

[Sidenote: _Zaires_ the Son of _Mango Inga_ submits to the _Spaniards_.]

_Huascar_ being destroy’d by _Attabaliba_, and _Attabaliba_ by
_Pizarro_, _Mango Inga_ their youngest Brother took the Government upon
him, made continual Sallies upon the _Spaniards_ from inaccessible
Mountains, and at his Decease left the remaining part of _Peru_ to his
Son _Zaires Topa_; who seeing no good to be done by force of Arms,
submitted himself freely to the King of _Spain_’s Jurisdiction in the
Year 1557. since which the _Spaniards_ have been sole Masters.

There are at this day four great Churches in _Cusco_: Also the
_Dominicans_, _Franciscans_, _Augustines_, and the Monks _De la Merced_,
have each of them stately Cloysters here: but the _Jesuits_ Structure
exceeds all the other.

Above forty thousand _Peruvians_ pay annual Tribute to this City. In the
Valley about the City feed abundance of Cattel; also Wheat, and all
manner of Herbs grow here in great plenty. The Gold and Silver-Mines
have not that resort which they had formerly, most of the Workmen being
remov’d to _Potosi_.

Concerning the Service which they perform’d in the fore-mention’d Temple
of the Sun, and their superstitious Opinions about their Idol _Con_,
they are much of the same ridiculous nature with what hath been already
Discours’d of in other places. Five Leagues Southwardly from _Cusco_
lies the Valley _Yucay_ between high snowy Mountains, under a temperate
Climate and pleasant Soil. Not far from hence the _Ingas_ built a most
invincible Castle on a Rock, which was surrounded with many cliffy Walls
one above another; these Walls were also Carv’d with Images of Lyons,
Tygers, and other wild Beasts, which held Lances in their Paws; the top
of the Rock was crown’d with a Royal Structure built of Stone, through
which ran Golden Veins, joyn’d together with a certain Gum, by some
call’d _Jews-Lime_. To the Province of _Condesuyo_ belong the valiant
People _Chumbibalcas_ and _Ubinas_. In the County _Pomatambo_ they make
Carpets of fine Wooll, curiously Painted.

8. The City _Francisco de Vittoria_, which lies in the rough Valley
_Vilcabamba_, and is inclos’d by the Mountains _Andes_, belonging to the
Jurisdiction of the Province _Andésuyo_.

9. The Village _Juan del Oro_, which is the chief Place of the Countrey
_Caravaya_, and so call’d by the _Spaniards_ from the fine Gold which is
found there in great abundance.

[Sidenote: Havens, Isles, and Points in _Peru_.]

Along the Sea-Coast of _Peru_ belonging to the Jurisdiction of _Los
Reyos_, lie the following Havens, Isles and Points.

South-East from the Promontory _Aguya_, rises the Isle _St. Roque_ out
of the South-Sea, surrounded with Rocks, and abounds with Birds of prey;
through the midst of it runs a River which divides the Island.

The Haven _Malabrigo_, ill defended against the Winds, cannot be entred
by great Vessels, unless in calm Weather.

Next follow the Harbors _Guanape_ and _Santa_, where the Ships us’d to
furnish themselves with Water out of a fresh River; _Casuya_ and
_Guarmay_, both inhabited by _Peruvians_.

Near the Mouth of the Road _Guara_ stands a large Salt-pan, the Salt
about which is found in great hard Pieces. The Island _Collao_ secures
the Haven before _Lima_.

Behind _Cape Guarco_ lies the _Lobos_; and not far from hence the Harbor
_Sangallan_, being so commodious that the _Spaniards_ consider’d a long
time whether they should build the City _Los Reyos_ here.

The Promontory _Nasca_ affords also good shelter for Ships; and the
Haven _Hacari_ yields store of Refreshments. Moreover, the Streams
_Oconna_, _Camana_, and _Quilca_ discharge their Waters into the Sea.

The Haven _Arequipa_ appears at its Mouth like a little Pool, surrounded
with Mountains.

Between _Quilca_ and the River _Tamboyalla_ lies the Isle _Nuli_; and a
little more Southward the Haven _Paracca_ and _Pisca_; and up in the
Countrey the Village _Yca_, where the most and best _Peruvian_ Wine is
to be had.


                               SECT. VI.
                              Los Charcas.

[Sidenote: Situation and Description of _Los Charcas_.]

_Los Charcas_ is the farthest Countrey Southward of the Kingdom of
_Peru_, reaching up as far as _Chile_, with which on the South it is
border’d, having on the North, _Lima_ and _Collao_; on the West, _Mare
del Zur_; and on the East, some Countreys not yet well discover’d, which
lie betwixt it and the Province of _Paraguay_, or _De la Plata_. The
Countrey is said to be in length about a hundred and fifty Leagues,
measuring it directly, or in a right Line from North to South; but
measuring it about along the Sea-Coast, much about two hundred: It is
not very rich either in Corn or Cattel, although in some parts it
wanteth not good Pasturage; but of unparalell’d Wealth, in respect of
the Mines of Gold and Silver which are here digg’d, the principal
whereof are those of _Potosi_ and _Parco_.

The Mountains hereabouts are inhabited by the _Cavinas_, who dwell in
Stone Houses. Their Neighbors the _Canches_ are a subtile, good natur’d,
and painful People, breed many Sheep, sowe Corn, and catch plenty of
Fish out of the Rivers. Next comes in view the cold Countrey _Conas_. On
the right side towards the Southern Ocean, the great Wilderness
_Parinacocha_ extends it self a vast way; the Mountains round about are
continually cover’d with Snow, and the Dales have many deep Moors.

[Illustration: POTOSI.]

[Sidenote: Principal Towns and Places of note.]

Chief Towns and Places of note in this part of _Peru_ are, 1. _Plata_,
otherwise call’d _Chuquisaca_, the Countrey whose Metropolis it is,
situate under a temperate Climate, in a fruitful Soil for the production
of all manner of Plants, and especially Wheat, Barley, and Grapes. In
this City the High Court of Judicature of _Los Charcas_ is kept, being a
principal part of _Peru_, and inhabited by the richest _Spaniards_ in
the whole Kingdom, having gotten an incredible deal of Treasure out of
the neighboring Silver-Mines, which from the time of the _Ingas_, or
Kings of _Peru_, to its Discovery by the _Spaniards_, held out and
continu’d so rich, that ’tis thought _Pizarro_, if Reason could have
rul’d him, might here onely have rais’d himself a Rent of two hundred
thousand Ducats _per Annum_; but his desire and hopes, first to find
more at _Potosi_, and afterwards his ambition and greediness to have and
command all, carried him to violent Courses, which proved his Ruine, as
hath been said. The Town is conveniently seated in a fruitful Soil,
honor’d with the Residence of the Governor of the Province, and with a
Bishops See, said to be the richest of _Peru_, _viz._ of fourscore
thousand Ducats _per Annum_. The Cathedral and divers Cloysters give
also a great lustre to the City. The antient Inhabitants of this
Countrey, especially about those parts where now this City stands, were
the _Charcas_ and _Charanques_, both valiant People, who by Command of
the _Ingas_ fetch’d invaluable Treasures out of the neighboring Mines of
_Porco_, where a thousand Men were continually kept at work. In _La
Plata_ were reckon’d long since, besides _Spaniards_, above sixty
thousand _Peruvians_ which pay annual Tribute.

2. _Oropesa_, a place of good Metal, as a man may perceive by the Name;
It lieth in the rich and pleasant Valley _Cochobamba_, twenty Leagues
distant from _La Plata_.

3. _Potosi_, eighteen Leagues Westward from _La Plata_, by the
_Spaniards_ call’d _The Imperial City_, built at the Foot of a Mountain
bearing the same Denomination, on a barren Soil under a cold Climate,
though but twenty one Degrees to the Southward of the _Equinoctial
Line_: the Cold proceeds from the high Lands, which lie bare to the
bleak and sharp Winds call’d _Tomohavi_, which blow every year very
fiercely from _May_ till _September_. But though the barren Countrey
produces no Fruit, yet no place in _Peru_ hath greater plenty of all
Provisions and Dainties than this, the Markets being always full of
Fruit, Salt-Meat, _Maiz_, _Papas_, Wheat, Sugar, Sweet-meats, and all
things that are requisite for the subsistence of Man-kind, which are
brought thither from all parts for the Silver, which is there in such
plenty. As to what concerns the famous Mountain _Potosi_ in the Countrey
of _Charcas_, it is of an Ash colour, and rises above the adjacent
Mountains in the form of a Sugar-Loaf; on the top of it stands a
Chappel, to which leads a craggy Path, which with a little care may be
rid up with a Horse; the heighth thereof is a thousand six hundred and
twenty four Rods, or a quarter of a League: at the Foot thereof appears
the Mine call’d _Guaina Potosi_, that is, The _young Potosi_; near which
the City _Potosi_ stands, being two Leagues in circumference, and is
adorn’d with a Church and Cloyster for the _Dominicans_, and exceedingly
resorted to by Traders.

In the time when the _Ingas_ Govern’d _Peru_, the Silver-Mines at
_Porco_ were very famous; but it was not till after the arrival of the
_Spaniards_ that Silver was found in _Guaina Potosi_, and by degrees the
Silver Veins which lay hid in the great _Potosi_; the manner of which
Discovery was as followeth:

[Sidenote: The occasion of the first Discovery of the Mines in
           _Potosi_.]

A _Peruvian_ call’d _Gualpa_, who work’d in the Mines at _Porco_, going
a Hunting, it chanc’d that the Game ran up the steep Mountain of
_Potosi_, which prevented his pursuing of it any farther; but the
Mountain being overgrown with Trees, he got hold from one Bough to
another to help himself up, and at last taking hold of the Bramble
call’d _Quinua_, he pull’d the same out of the Ground, and finding it
heavy, look’d upon it, and espy’d a great lump of Silver hanging at the
Root of it; whereupon viewing the Hole, he discover’d a rich Silver
Vein; of which taking some pieces home, and melting them, he found that
it was the best Silver that ever he had known; wherefore he privately
got a greater quantity, and by degrees grew extraordinary rich: but
though he carried his Design never so close, yet he was at last
suspected, and especially by his Neighbor _Guanca_, born in the Valley
_Xauxa_, who was the more jealous of him, because he sold greater Bars
of Silver than any were cast at _Porco_; whereupon he resolv’d to speak
to him, and getting out the Secret, it came to this Agreement between
them, That they should both be Partners and share the Booty; _Gualpa_
was to keep the Vein, since call’d _The Rich Vein_, and _Guanca_ was to
have another, at present nam’d _Diego Centeno_: but they agreed not
long; for _Guanca_ finding much labor upon his Vein, by reason of the
hardness, and that he could get no share in what _Gualpa_ got,
acquainted his _Spanish_ Master _Vilaroel_ with it, who rested not till
he had found out the truth thereof; for which _Vilaroel_ obtain’d
(according to the Custom of _Porco_) several Rods to work for himself,
onely paying the King one fifth part of what he got, and so remain’d
Owner of the Mine _Centeno_.

[Sidenote: The Mine _Potosi_, when discover’d.]

This Discovery of the rich Mine _Potosi_ is said to have hapned on the
twenty fourth of _April_, _Anno 1545._ Soon after which they found the
Silver Vein _Del Estanno_, which though it was very rich, was difficult
to be digg’d, because of its hardness. The first Vein which _Gualpa_
search’d after stood upright from the bottom of the Mine, and contain’d
above three hundred Foot in length, and thirteen in breadth, and
continuing good for two hundred Foot in depth, after which the Silver
begins to lessen.

The _Peruvians_ relate, That the _Ingas_ first began to dig in _Potosi_,
but gave it over because the Workmen heard a terrible Voice, saying,
_Leave off doing what you are about; the Treasures which lie hid here,
are reserv’d for a People out of foreign Countreys_.

These Mines produce yearly for the King’s fifth part, forty thousand
Pieces of Silver, each valu’d at thirteen _Ryals_, each _Ryal_ being
four Shillings, besides what he is defrauded of, which is perhaps half
as much more.

The Mines of _Potosi_ exceed all other, because the Diggers never meet
with any Water, notwithstanding they work above two hundred Fathom under
Ground, whereas the other Silver Mines suffer great damage by the Water;
which was also the reason why the _Spaniards_ left off digging of Silver
in _Porco_, because they were not onely forc’d to cut through hard
Rocks, but ran greater danger, or at least bestow’d extraordinary labor
to get out the Water which broke in upon them.

[Sidenote: Four Silver Veins, with their several Divisions.]

The four Silver Veins of _Potosi_, _viz._ _The Rich_, _Centeno_, _Del
Estanno_, and _Mendieta_, lie on the East-side of the Mountain, and
extend North and South. The great Veins produce lesser, not unlike the
Body of a Tree, from which shoot forth several degrees of Boughs. Each
Vein is divided into several parts, possess’d by several Owners; the
least part is open’d four Rods, and the biggest eighty; for none are
permitted by the Law to open a bigger Hole. In the time of the Jesuit
_Joseph de Acosta_, an Eye-witness, who _Anno 1587._ went from _Peru_ to
_Spain_, the _Rich Vein_ was reckon’d to contain eighty seven Mines, of
which some were digg’d two hundred Fathom deep. The _Spaniards_ judge
that at the Root of the _Rich Vein_ is an incredible Treasure, though
Experience hath hitherto taught us, that the Silver lessens in price and
quantity the deeper they dig in the Ground.

[Sidenote: The _Socabonos_ or Trenches, with the manner of Mining.]

For the more easie working in the Mines, the _Spaniards_ have digg’d
Trenches (which they call _Socabonos_) at the Foot of the Mountain
towards the West, cross through the Mountain to the Mine, each of them
being eight Foot broad and a Fathom deep, and lock’d up with Gates,
through which the Silver is carried out, whereof the Owner of the
_Socabon_ receives a fifth part. The _Socabon_ which leads to the _Rich
Vein_, was begun _Anno 1556._ and finish’d in twenty nine years, extends
it self two hundred and fifty Rods in length. The Miners work by
Candle-light both Day and Night by turns; those that work in the Day,
sleep in the Night, and those that work in the Night, sleep in the Day.
The Oar, which is as hard as a Stone, is cut out with Pick-axes, beaten
in pieces with an Iron Crow, and carried upon their Backs on Ladders
made of Leather: Each Ladder hath three Fastnings about the thickness of
a Cable, stretch’d out by Sticks, so that one goes up on one side,
whilest another comes down on the other. Each Ladder being ten Fathom
long, is pitch’d upon its several Floor on which the Laborers rest
before they go up higher, for they make divers Floors according to the
depth of the Mine. The Laborers carry the Oar in Bags fastned before on
their Breasts, and falling back over their Shoulders three and three
together, the foremost whereof ties a lighted Candle to his Thumb, and
thus they help themselves with both Hands. It is a wonderful thing to
consider, how the _Peruvians_ are able to scramble up and down
continually a hundred and fifty Fathom: But besides many other
Inconveniences, the Mines often fall in, or at least great pieces, which
bury all the Diggers. The Mines also, being excessive cold, occasion to
those that are not us’d to them, a _Vertigo_ in the Head, and Vomiting.
The Silver runs for the most part between two Rocks, as it were, in a
long Channel, of which one side is as hard as Flint, and the other much
softer. This Silver is of different value; the best, call’d _Cacilla_ or
_Tacana_, resembles Amber in colour; the worser sort is blackish, and
sometimes of an Ash-colour. The pieces of Oar are carry’d on the Backs
of the Sheep _Pacos_ to the Mill, where being ground to Powder, they are
put into Furnaces to melt; of which there were once above six thousand
on the top of _Potosi_; but since the Quicksilver was found to cleanse
the same, not a third part remains pure.

In former times the Mines at _Porco_, two Leagues from the little Lake
_Aulagas_, produc’d those vast Treasures gather’d by the _Ingas_, which
afterwards for the most part fell into the _Spaniards_ Hands.

[Sidenote: Port-Towns, Rivers, and Havens of _Los Charcas_.]

As concerning the Sea-Coast of _Los Charcas_, it lies as followeth:
Southerly from the River _Tambopalla_ puts forth a three-pointed Rock
into the Ocean, and makes the Haven _De Ylo_, into which falls a fresh
River. Next follow the round Hill _Morro de los Diabolos_, and the Inlet
before the Town _Arica_, secur’d from all except a Westerly Wind, where
the Silver that comes from _Potosi_ is Shipp’d for _Lima_. Since the
_English_ Admiral Sir _Francis Drake_ took three Barks out of this Inlet
it is fortifi’d with a Castle, which is stor’d with Brass Guns.

Nine Leagues Southward the _Pissaqua_ falls into the Ocean; and next you
come to the little Village _Hicahic_, situate on a high and barren Tract
of Land; as also the Haven _Terrapaca_, which by an Inland is made very
secure.

Not far from hence appears the Foot of _Piqua_, where the Coast begins
to rise very high; the Head of _Tacama_, the Stream _Lottoya_, otherwise
call’d _De Loa_, whose Banks are inhabited by poor People; the River
_Montelo_, the Promontory _Morro Moreno_, beyond whose utmost Point
opens a Bay, secur’d from all Winds by an Island. The Inhabitants here
feed on raw Fish.

Next the River _Claru_ comes in view, which is taken for a Boundary
between _Peru_ and _Chili_.

Eastward up into the Countrey you come to _Santa Cruiz_, built at the
Foot of a Mountain in a Plain near a Brook, which rushing forth from a
Rock glides through the City to a Lake full of delicious Fish. The
Houses of Stone, are cover’d with Palm-Tree Leaves; and besides the
Church there is also a Cloyster, inhabited by the Monks _De la Merced_.
In former times the _Peruvian_ Houses were built of Clay, and were often
destroy’d by their Neighbors the _Cheriguanacs_ and _Titanes_, who made
Feasts with as many as they took of them. The People about this Place
are meek and poor spirited, and speak besides four Languages, the
_Diagnitan_ Tongue, common amongst all of them. Before the Arrival of
the _Spaniards_ they went Cloth’d in Ostritches Feathers, but since
taught to weave Cotton, they now make their Apparel of the same, and
upon the account of Barter, drive a great Trade in it: They Dye their
Cotton with the boyl’d Roots and Leaves of a little Tree.

Eastward beyond _Santa Cruiz_ lies the Countrey _Paicanos_, eminent for
the great _Calabashes_ which grow there, exceeding good to keep both wet
and dry Meats in.

The Countrey receives a vicissitude of excessive Cold and intolerable
Heat; the hard Winters taking beginning in _May_, and continuing till
the beginning of _August_. In the middle of our Summer a South-wind
blows seven Weeks together here, to the great prejudice of all Plants,
which are during that time often wash’d away by continual Rains. About
_Christmas_ they Sowe, and gather in their Harvest in _March_. During
the rainy Season the Ways cannot be travell’d, being all overflow’d by
the Rivers; neither doth the _Palm-Wood_, which is four days Journey in
length, permit any access to the said City _Santa Cruiz_, because the
conflux of Waters makes it a Moor all over; besides which, the Tygers,
Bears, and Serpents, make the Ways dangerous, especially at that time.

Through this Countrey the _Spanish_ Captain _Nusco de Chavas_ travell’d,
when he discover’d the _Taguamacis_, a numerous People, which dwell
along the great River _De la Plata_.

The Countrey about _Santa Cruiz_ produces all manner of Fruit, but few
Trees, because of the want of Rain; but Corn, _Maiz_, Wine,
_Granadillas_, _Luiumas_, and _Tucumay_, as also the Plant _Hachalindi_,
in the _Latine_ Tongue call’d _Mirabile Peruanum_, grow here in great
abundance; which last shoots up to the bigness of a pretty large Body,
full of Juice, and of a yellowish colour, out of which shoot knotty
Boughs, and about each Knot two Leaves resembling the Herb _Nightshade_;
the Flowers which hang at the ends of the Boughs are long, and pleasant
to the Eye, by reason of their mixture of Purple, White, and Yellow, and
also of a sweet smell. It is a strange Secret in Nature, that this
Flower opens at Midnight, if any Light come near the same: The Root also
is accounted an effectual Medicine against the Dropsie.


                               SECT. VII.
                                Collao.

[Sidenote: Situation and Description of _Collao_.]

_Collao_ lieth Southward of those Countries, which go under the general
Name of the Province of _Cusco_, having on the West, _Lima_; on the
South, _Charcas_; but Eastward, and to the North-East, it is shut up by
a Ridge of Mountains, running in one Body or continu’d Tract from the
Confines of _Collao_, as far as the City of _Cusco_, where they divide.
The Countrey is generally plain, commodiously water’d in all Parts with
fresh Rivers, and consequently affording rich Pasturage and good Herds
of Cattel.

[Sidenote: Chief Towns and Places of note.]

The chief Towns and Places of note are, 1. _Chuquinga_, a great Town,
and held to be naturally almost impregnable, as being environ’d round
about either with deep unfordable Waters, or with Mountains unpassable,
and having one onely Cawsey leading to it, reported to be for two or
three Leagues together no broader than to permit one single Person to
march conveniently upon it.

2. The City _Pucara_, which was formerly well inhabited, but at present
nothing remains of it, except the ruin’d Walls of great Houses, and
large Images of Stone.

3. _Ayavire_, by the _Spaniards_ call’d _Las Sepulturas_, being a Place
especially enobled by the stately Monuments of the _Peruvian_ Nobility
which were found there.

4. _Hatuncolla_, the Metropolis or chief Town of this Province, seated
upon the Banks of the River _Caravaya_, whose Streams are very much
fam’d for Gold.

[Illustration: CALLAO de LIMA]

The River _Caravaya_, which glides from the _Andes_ Eastward to the City
_Juan del Oro_, produces much fine Gold, but not without the loss of
many People, which are kill’d by the unwholsom Air and Damps that arise
here.

[Sidenote: The Lake _Titicaca_.]

The Lake _Titicaca_, which washes the Countrey _Collao_ on the North,
the Province of _Omasuy_ on the East, _Chaquito_ on the West, and
_Chuquiabo_ on the South, is one of the greatest Lakes of _America_,
being eighty Leagues in circumference, and in several places as many
Fathom deep; wherefore it is exceeding rough in windy Weather. Into this
Lake ten great Rivers discharge their Waters, which run away again
through a narrow, but very deep Channel, in which the Stream runs so
strong, that no Boats are able to abide in it.

5. _Chinquita_, a Colony of _Spaniards_ upon the Banks of _Titicaca_,
having many small Islands in it of a good and fruitful Soil, abounding
in Fish and variety of Sea-Fowl; it is suppos’d to be fourscore Leagues
distant likewise from the South Sea, having onely one _Estuary_ or
Mouth, which is something strait, but of such a deep Water and violent
Stream, that (as _Acosta_ testifieth of it) it is not possible to build
a Bridge of Stone or Timber over it; but the Natives in stead thereof
have laid a Bridge of Straw upon it, which serves as well, _viz._ so
many great Bundles of Straw, Sedge, or such like matter, well and surely
made up and fastned together, as will reach from one side or Bank of the
_Estuary_ to another; at which likewise having made them sure, they cast
some good quantity of more Straw and Sedge upon them, and have a Bridge
very convenient, upon which they both securely pass themselves, and also
drive Cattel, and do other necessary Business. The Water is neither
bitter nor brackish, yet is not drinkable because of its muddiness.
Several Islands that lie in the Lake serv’d formerly for Store-houses of
the chiefest Goods, which the People thereabouts living near the
High-way would not trust in their Villages.

[Sidenote: The Plant _Totara_.]

Here grows a certain Broom-Plant call’d _Totara_, good for many uses,
and is also wholsom Food both for Man and Beast; moreover, they cover
their Houses with the same, burn it on their Hearths, and make Boats.
The _Uros_, a salvage People, made Floats of _Totara_, which they ty’d
together, and built Villages on the same, which drove to and again,
according as the Wind blew.

The Lake also breeds abundance of Fish, and especially two sorts, _viz._
_Suches_, which are very pleasing to the Palate, but unwholsom; and the
_Bogas_, which though less, and full of Bones, are a much better Food.
There likewise breed plenty of Fowls about the same, especially wild
Geese and Ducks.

When the _Peruvians_ intend to Entertain any Person, they go to catching
of Fowls (by them call’d _Chaco_) after this manner: They make a Circle
with the Floats nam’d _Balsas_, and Rowing close to one another, take up
the inclos’d Fowl with their Hands.

Moreover, the fore-mention’d Channel, through which the Lake _Titicaca_
discharges its Water, ends in a little Lake call’d _Aulagas_, likewise
full of desolate Isles, but hath no visible place into which to empty
its Water, therefore it must needs, according to the course of Nature,
fall under Ground, where it commixes with a Stream whose original is
unknown, though it be seen to fall into the South Sea.

The Town is a Place of extraordinary Wealth and Trading, and so
considerable, that the Governor thereof is always nam’d by the King of
_Spain_ himself, and his Place estimated at fifty thousand Ducats _per
Annum_.

6. _Tiaguanaco_, at the _Estuary_, or Mouth of the Lake, memorable onely
for the Ruines of certain great and stupendious Buildings which
antiently have stood there, some of the Stones whereof are said to have
been of thirty Foot length apiece, fifteen Foot broad, and six or seven
Foot thick. There were likewise found the Statues of certain Men
excellently Carv’d and Wrought, of a Gigantick stature or bigness, and
likewise veiled in foreign and strange Habits, not at all us’d, nor ever
known to have been us’d by the _Peruvians_ themselves, or by any other
of the Natives of _America_.

7. _Nuestra Sennora de la Paz_, or _Our Lady of Peace_, otherwise call’d
_Pueblo Nuevo_: It is but a small Town, yet pleasantly seated upon the
Banks of a River in a fair and fruitful Plain, full of Springs,
Fruit-Trees, _Savanas_, and Fields of _Maiz_, having Mountains on either
side: It lieth almost in the middle of the Province _Chuquinabo_,
fourteen Leagues distant from _Cusco_, and as many from _Potosi_. The
Province _Chuquinabo_ it self (which in the _Peruvian_ Tongue signifies
_Inheritance of Gold_) hath many rich Gold-Mines, good Salt-pits, and a
temperate Climate, except from the beginning of _December_ till _March_,
in which time the continual Rains cause Feavers and Agues. The
Inhabitants being very poor People, us’d to go naked in the Summer
Season.

8. _Copavana_, two and twenty Leagues beyond _Lopoz_: It is onely
inhabited by _Peruvians_; amongst whom an Image of the Virgin _Mary_,
long since erected there, hath been ever in great veneration, especially
by reason of a Tradition of a great Miracle there perform’d: for the
_Spaniards_ affirm, That _Johannes Anachoreta_ going a Journey of
several Weeks from home, plac’d a lighted Candle before the Image, which
during the time of his absence did not at all diminish.

[Sidenote: A strange Earthquake at _Angoanga_.]

An Accident which fell out in this Countrey is very remarkable, _viz._
The Ground of an old Village call’d _Angoanga_, then inhabited by
eminent Necromancers, began on a sudden to swell, and the Earth to run
like a broken Wave two Leagues, overwhelming the Houses in Sand, and
filling up a neighboring Lake.

[Sidenote: The like in _Herefordshire_ in _England_.]

Eight years before this terrible Earthquake here, there hapned in the
County of _Hereford_ in _England_ almost the same kind of prodigious
Motion: for not far from the Town _Ledborough_, arose _Marcely Hill_ to
an exceeding heighth, and moving along bury’d all whate’re it met with,
after which manner it continu’d for the space of three days, to the
great terror of all that beheld it.

9. _Chilane_; 10. _Acos_; 11. _Pomata_, and some others, all of them
good Towns, but not so considerable as those other.

[Sidenote: Roads and High-ways made by the _Ingas_.]

Concerning the Roads or High-ways, it may well be said, That none of the
seven Wonders of the World can compare with any one of them; neither was
the Way that _Appius Claudius_ made from _Rome_ to _Brundusium_, upon
the repairing of which the Emperors _Julius_ and _Augustus_ spent great
sums of Money, fit to stand in competition with the Roads made by the
_Ingas_ in _Peru_: for who cannot but admire at the consideration of so
many Valleys fill’d with Mountains, the hardest Rocks cut asunder, Moors
damm’d up, great Stone Bridges laid over swift gliding Streams, and
through vast Wildernesses a Way made of twenty Foot broad, inclos’d in
high Walls, extending from _Quito_ to _Chilo_, a thousand Leagues, and
at the end of every ten Leagues brave Houses or Magazines, stor’d with
Bowes, Arrows, Halberds, Axes, Clubs, Clothes, and Provision for twenty
or thirty thousand Men. Some relate, that _Guainacava_, when he return’d
Victor from the conquer’d Countrey _Quito_, suffer’d great
Inconveniences on the pathless Mountains, and thereupon Commanded his
Subjects to make the fore-mention’d Way. But it is more probable, that
this Master-piece was not the work of one _Inga_, especially since
besides the Way from _Chili_ to _Quito_ there leads another through the
Mountains over the Plains from _Cusco_ to _Quito_, forty Foot broad, and
five hundred Leagues long, inclos’d within two Walls.

[Sidenote: The manner of the _Peruvian_ Registers.]

The _Peruvians_ relate from the testimony of the _Quipos_, much more
concerning these High-Ways, and other Buildings on them, made by
_Guainacava_. These _Quipos_ are Rowls of divers colour’d Strings, full
of all manner of Knots, which serve in stead of Characters to keep their
Chronicles; in which were employ’d the _Quipo-Camayos_, who being in the
nature of our Secretaries, Registred all Transactions, performing the
same with the several Strings and Buttons, with which they gave
Obligations, Discharges, and the like: but besides the _Quipos_ they
also us’d Rings full of little Stones for the same purpose; and knew
with _Maiz_-Seed how to cast up an Account as well as the best

Their Account of Time hung on the twelve Pillars _Succanga_, erected on

[Sidenote: The present State of _Peru_ under the _Spanish_ Government.]

The _Spanish_ Government in the Kingdom of _Peru_ is setled at present
in great tranquility and splendor. The Vice-Roy, who keeps a splendid
Court in _Lima_, otherwise call’d _Los Reyos_, Commands over _Chili_ and
_Terra Firma_, and never comes abroad without a Guard of forty
Halberdeers: when he travels by Land he is accompanied by the
Arch-bishop, and guarded by his forty Halberdeers, a hundred Pike-men,
and fifty Musquetteers. His Reign is generally not above six or eight
years, during which time he receives forty thousand Ducats _per Annum_
out of the King’s Exchequer.

[Sidenote: The present flourishing Condition of the City _Los Reyos_.]

The City _Los Reyos_ hath been of late years very much enlarg’d and
brought to a most flourishing Condition, being exceeding populous, and
extending four Miles in length, and half as much in breadth: In the
biggest Market-place is the City Hall and the Exchange, where all things
are brought to be sold. Of the other three Markets, two have their
Denominations from _St. Anne_ and _St. Jacob_; the fourth is call’d _El
Santo de los Cavallos_, because nothing but Mules, Asses, and Horses are
sold there. The chief Church is Consecrated to _St. John_ the
Evangelist; the other Three to _Marcellus_, _Sebastian_, and _Anna_. The
_Franciscans_ inhabit three Cloysters; the _Dominicans_, _Augustines_,
and Monks _De la Merced_, each of them two, besides two costly
Structures for the _Jesuits_. Other Orders have also five Cloysters
here, _viz._ the _Creation_, _Conception_, the _Holy Trinity_, _St.
Joseph_, and _St. Clara_; the three first have each of them a Church
built hard by the several Cloysters, Dedicated to the _Santas Virgines
del Montserratto_, _Del Prado_, and _De Loretto_. Each Cloyster contains
above two hundred and fifty either Monks or Nuns. Here are also four
large Hospitals, the chiefest whereof call’d _Andrias_, hath seldom less
than four hundred Sick, which are kept and cur’d on Charity. The second
is for _Peruvians_ onely, call’d _The Hospital of St. Anna_. The third,
built in honor of the Apostle _St. Peter_, is for poor old Clergy-men.
The fourth, nam’d _The House of Love_, is for sick Women. Besides these
there stands another Structure near the Walls of the City, Consecrated
to _Lazarus_, where those that have the Leprosie are cur’d. The House
call’d _The Holy-Ghost_, receives all sick and wounded Sea-men. The King
maintains twenty four Students at his own Charge in the Royal Colledge,
and the Arch-bishop as many in the Colledge call’d _St. Toronius_; but
in the Colledge of _St. Martin_ reside above six hundred, which are
brought up in all manner of Arts and Sciences. Two hundred Students are
also taught in the high School, where they chuse a new Governor every
year. Here also is kept the King’s Treasure, and the Court of
Inquisition. The River which washes the City Walls runs so exceeding
swift, that not long since it carried away a new Stone Bridge with nine
great Arches.

[Sidenote: Miracles reported to have been done by _Ramirez_.]

The _Dominican_ Monks were the first that Landed on _Peru_, the first
which came thither with _Francisco Pizarro_ being _Vincent de Valle
Verde_, who was follow’d by _Sancio Martino_, _Martino de Esquivele_,
_Dominico de Sancto Thoma_, _Pedro Ulloa_, _Alphonso de Montenegro_,
_Reynaldo Pedraza_, and many others, who were stirr’d up by the report
of the _Peruvian_ Riches; amongst whom were four _Franciscans_, viz.
_Pedro Portuguese_, _Jodoco de los Angelos_, _De la Cruiz_, and _De Sant
Anna_, who were soon after follow’d by twelve Monks of the _Augustine_
Order. _Anno 1552._ Landed also at _Los Reyos_, Colonel _Andreas
Salazar_, accompanied with _Antonio Lozano_, _Juan de Sancto Petro_,
_Hieronymo Melendez_, _Didaco Palamino_, _Pedro de Espeda_, _Andreas
Ortega_, _Juan Canto_, _Juan Chamorro_, _Francisco de Treyas_, _Juan
Ramirez_, and _Balthazar Melgarego_. _Salazar_ soon after his Arrival
sent the Priest _Juan Ramirez_, and _Balthazar Melganego_ to
_Guamachuco_, where he Baptiz’d and Instructed the Inhabitants in great
numbers. Afterwards travelling to _Moyabamba_, he got a great esteem
amongst those Idolaters, and (as it goes for currant amongst them)
wrought many Miracles, amongst which this is reported for one: He being
inform’d by an old _Peruvian_, that his Daughter nam’d _Curi_ had hid
several Idols; enquiring after it, he tax’d her with what her Father had
told him; which she denying, and being rebuk’d by _Ramirez_, is said to
have become immediately dumb, to have foam’d at the Mouth, at last
falling down dead like a second _Saphira_ in the presence of many, which
caus’d many to forsake their Idolatry. But the Necromancers endeavor’d
by all means possible to raise a disesteem on _Ramirez_, and with the
assistance of their Master the Devil, so wrought their Inchantments,
that the Tygers came in great Herds out of the Wildernesses to
_Moyabamba_, and devour’d not onely Men, Women and Children in the
Highways, but also tore them out of their Houses, yet did not the least
hurt to any _Spaniard_; whereupon _Ramirez_ valiantly went with a
Company of his Proselytes to a Herd of Tygers, which when he approached
held the Cross to them, which it seems so affrighted the Devil-Tygers,
that they climb’d up the Trees. They farther relate (if you will believe
them) to make the Miracle the greater, That _Ramirez_ call’d to the
Multitude, saying, _Go and revenge the Deaths of your devour’d Parents,
Children and Relations_; whereupon he throwing a Stone, and all the rest
following his Example, the Tygers leap’d out of the Trees, stood still,
and suffer’d themselves to be kill’d like Lambs. Six years after the
fore-mention’d twelve _Augustine_ Monks follow’d eleven others, who set
Sail out of the _Spanish_ Haven _St. Lucar_, and arriving at _Peru_ went
to the Village _Tauca_, where they broke the Image of the Goddess
_Huarella_, being as it were the _Peruvian Venus_, or Patroness of
amorous Delights, reported to have given Responses from the Wood in
which she was worshipp’d. They also destroy’d the Idol _Chanca_ in the
Countrey _Conchucos_, which being worshipp’d by the _Indians_ in the
shape of a Man, had yearly a fair Maid, aged fourteen years, given to
him in Marriage, a solemn Wedding being kept, and several Sheep kill’d.

[Sidenote: The Miracle of an _Augustine_ Monk.]

The _Augustine_ Monks are believ’d to have wrought also another Miracle
in the Province _Conchucos_, upon this occasion: A Conjurer call’d
_Chaumango_, boasted himself to be _God_, deny’d our _Saviour_, in
testimony whereof he gave out that he would kick a Mountain to pieces,
with his Foot; which Report spreading all over the Countrey, all the
adjacent People flock’d to see this strange Wonder on an appointed Day,
on which _Charimango_ being, it seems, as good as his word, and kicking
the Mountain, caus’d it to rent from the top to the bottom, and the
pieces to flie all about the People, who were exceedingly amaz’d; but
the Sorcerer upon the _Augustine_ Monk’s rebuking him was (as they
affirm) immediately eaten up with Worms.

[Illustration: CHILI]

Many other Stories of Miracles go currant amongst them, as of _Marco
Garcia_ and _Didaco Ortez_ driving the Devil from a white Stone which
hung over a Fountain in _Chiquipalpa_, and several others, but it would
be very impertinent to dwell too long upon Discourses of this nature,
especially since we are not oblig’d to make them a part of our Creed.

To conclude our Description of this famous Kingdom of _Peru_, the People
thereof at the _Spaniards_ first Arrival viewing their Shipping, their
Guns, and other Accoutrements, unknown to them before, had them in great
admiration, as Men descended from Heaven; but when they began to be
oppress’d by their Tyranny, and to be tortur’d by them, they look’d upon
them as the Spawn of Hell, and curs’d the Sea that had brought so wicked
a People to them.

                                 Chile.


[Sidenote: Situation and Description of _Chile_.]

Following the Coast of _Mare del Zur_, or the South Sea, the next great
Province pertaining formerly to the Kingdom of _Peru_, is that of
_Chile_. This is the most Southerly Province of the whole Countrey of
_America_, reaching up as far as the _Magellane_ Straights, with which
to the Southward it is bounded; Northward it hath a Desart, and an
undiscover’d Countrey lying betwixt it and the Confines of _Peru_,
call’d _Atacama_; on the West it hath _Mare del Zur_; and on the East,
up to _Rio de la Plata_, the _Atlantick_, or North Sea, with some
Countreys undiscover’d, which interpose betwixt it and _Paraguay_ to the
North-East: It lieth all of it beyond the _Tropick_ of _Capricorn_, in a
temperate _Zone_, and extendeth it self in length from the Borders of
_Peru_, to the Mouth of the _Straights_ five hundred Leagues or more;
but the breadth of it neither equal nor certain: They say ’tis call’d
_Chile_ from the word _Chil_, which signifies _Cold_ it seems in their
Language as well as ours, it being generally a cold and bleak Countrey,
the Air in many parts of it so extreamly sharp and piercing, that both
Horse and Rider sometimes in travelling are frozen to death, as the
_Spaniards_ found by experience in their first Search and Discovery of
the Countrey, under the Conduct of _Diego Almagro_, who is said to have
left the greatest part of his Men dead behind him: But this is chiefly
towards the _Andes_, and on the Sea-Coast, the more Inland parts of it,
though mountainous also in some parts, yet are more temperate, and being
also well water’d with Rivers, are much more fruitfull than the other,
affording both Wheat and _Maiz_, and likewise other Grain, excellent
Pasturage in many places, and great store of Cattel, Wine, Honey, and
not without many and rich Mines both of Gold and Silver.

[Sidenote: _Pedro Baldivia_ taken Prisoner and put to death by the
           _Arucans_.]

The Natives of this Countrey were found to be the most stout and warlike
of all the _Americans_ that the _Spaniards_ had hitherto met withal,
fighting with them, and oftentimes defeating them in the open Field,
surprizing and sacking their Towns, and last of all taking their Captain
and Commander in Chief Prisoner: This was _Pedro Baldivia_, one of those
good Men that consented to the death of _Attabaliba_, the last King of
_Peru_, after a greater Ransom accepted and paid, then perhaps the King
of _Spain_ could well raise on a sudden, if he had occasion to use it
for himself. The _Arucans_ (for so are the People call’d that had him
Prisoner) are said to have Entertain’d him for a while with great
Jollity and Feasting, but for his last Draught gave him a Cup of melted
Gold, which the poor Man was forc’d to take down, and so died a cruel,
though costly Death.

The whole Province generally is divided first into _Chile_, specially so
call’d, and secondly _Magellanica_, or that part which lieth more
Southward down to the _Straights_ of _Magellan_.


                               SECT. II.
                       Chile, properly so call’d.

[Sidenote: The Bounds of _Chile_ specially so call’d.]

_Chile_, specially so call’d, is border’d Northward with the Desart and
barren Countrey of _Atacama_ above mention’d; on the South, with
_Magellanica_; on the West, with _Mare del Zur_; Eastward, and to the
North-East, with some parts of _Paraguay_, or rather with some
undiscover’d Countreys lying betwixt them both: The length of it from
North to South is reckon’d to be little less than three hundred Leagues,
and generally of a fruitful Soil, affording besides abundance of Gold
and Silver, both Corn, Cattel, Vineyards, and divers sorts of Fruits,
equal both for kind and plenty to _Spain_ it self, and sundry other
parts of _Europe_. The Air likewise temperate, and the People in their
Manners and Conditions come much nearer to the Civility, and likewise
subtilty of the _Europeans_, than other _Americans_ did; which doubtless
may be attributed to the conformity of the Climates under which they
lie, agreeable to those of _Europe_; though otherwise in respect of the
Sphere and Seasons of the Year, there be a diametrical difference
betwixt us; As for Example, their _Spring_ beginning in _September_,
which is our _Autumn_, and their _Autumn_ in _March_, which is our
_Spring_; their longest Day being that of _St. Lucy_, on the eleventh of
_December_, which is our shortest; and their shortest being _St.
Barnabas_, _viz._ the eleventh of _June_, which is our longest, _&c._

[Sidenote: Towns and Places of Importance.]

The Towns of chiefest note and importance in this Province, are 1.
_Gopiapo_, an old Town in the most Northerly parts of this Province
towards the Sea, where it hath a very commodious Haven belonging to it.

2. _La Serena_, a Town situate on the Banks of _Coquimbo_, a pleasant
River a little above its Influx into the Sea, built by _Baldivia_ in the
Year 1544. the Countrey about very rich in Mines of Gold, and the Town
it self so well Garrison’d for fear of the Natives, that when the
_English_ under Sir _Francis Drake_, about fourscore years since,
attempted the gaining of the Place, they found hot Service of it, being
stoutly resisted and beaten back again to their Ships, by a Sally of no
less than three hundred good Horse and two hundred Foot.

3. _St. Jago_, the principal Town of the Province, a Bishop’s See, and
the ordinary Residence of the Governor, lying on the Banks of the River
_Tapocalma_, in the thirty fourth Degree of Southern Latitude, fifteen
Leagues distant from the South Sea, at which it hath a very commodious
and much frequented Haven, which they call _Valparayso_, and where the
_English_ met with better fortune, as hath been said already in the
report of Sir _Francis Drake_’s Voyage.

4. _La Conception_, a strong Town, seated on the Bay call’d _Penco_,
sixty or seventy Leagues distant from _St. Jago_ towards the South, a
Place not a little fortifi’d both by Nature and Art, having the Bay and
a certain Ridge of high Mountains begirting it almost round about; and
where it is otherwise accessible, a Castle, and certain Bulwarks with
Ordnance, besides a Garrison of five hundred Soldiers at least
continually in it, and all little enough to defend it against the
_Araucanes_, their deadly Enemies, who live thereabouts, and are ever
and anon making Incursions almost up to the Walls of it. Over against
this Place in _Mare del Zur_, but very near the Shore, there lieth a
certain Island call’d _St. Maries_, exceeding plentiful in Swine and all
sorts of Poultrey, which the Garrison of _La Conception_ make good use
of.

[Illustration: MAGELLANCICA.]

5. _Los Confines_, a Fronteer Town, built by the aforesaid _Baldivia_,
for defence of the rich Mines of Gold at _Angol_, a Place near
adjoyning.

6. _La Imperiale_, another strong Garrison of this Place on the Banks of
the River _Cauten_, near to which that great Battel was fought, where
_Baldivia_, with divers other Soldiers, were taken Prisoners, who were
no otherwise overcome, but by being over-wearied with killing of their
Enemies, and by that means not able to make their Retreat.

7. _Villarica_, another Colony of the _Spaniards_ in these Parts,
sixteen Leagues distant from _Imperiale_, and twenty five from the Sea.

8. _Baldivia_, so nam’d from the Commander _Pedro Baldivia_, who built
it in the Valley of _Guadallanquen_, two or three Leagues distant from
the Sea, where it hath a good and capacious Port; but nearer to it the
best Mines of _Peru_, so rich, that ’tis said they yielded _Baldivia_
every day so long as he could enjoy them, twenty five thousand Crowns.

9. _Osorno_, a Town lying in the Bay of _Chilue_ in a barren Soil, but
otherwise neither less rich, nor less populous than _Baldivia_ it self.

These three last mention’d Towns, _viz._ _Baldivia_, _Imperiale_, and
_Osorno_, were in the Years 1596, 1699, and 1604, surpriz’d by the
_Araucanes_, and other Salvages confederate with them, sack’d and burnt;
and though the _Spaniards_ be said to have recover’d and Garrison’d some
of them with fresh Soldiers, yet how long they were able to hold them,
or whether they be Masters of them at this day, we cannot say.

10. _Castro_, the most Southerly Town of the whole Province, built on a
certain Island within the Bay of _Chilue_.

11. _Mendoza_; and 12. _St. Juan de la Frontera_, both which lie towards
_Paraguay_ and _Rio de la Plata_, but on the other side of the _Andes_,
forty Leagues distant from any of those we have spoken of, and perhaps
more, not above a hundred from _Buenos Ayres_, and the _Atlantick_
Ocean.


                               SECT. III.
                              Magellanica.

[Sidenote: Situation and Description of _Magellanica_.]

[Sidenote: Sea-Port, Towns, Isles, and Straights.]

_Magellanica_, the other part of this Province, is bounded Northward,
with _Chile_ abovesaid, and some parts of the Countrey _De la Plata_; on
the South, with the narrow Sea call’d _Magellans Straights_; having
_Mare del Zur_ on the West, and on the East the _Atlantick_ Ocean. It
contains in length from the Borders of _Chile_ to the Mouth of the
_Straights_, a hundred Leagues, and in breadth from the North to the
South Sea, somewhat more, _viz._ towards _Chile_ and the North-West
parts of it, for towards the South and South-West it straitens still
more and more, insomuch that they who resemble the Southern part of
_America_ to the form of a Pyramid revers’d, make this part of the
Countrey to be the Spire or top thereof. It beareth the Name from
_Ferdinand Magellan_, a _Portuguese_, who first discover’d that narrow
Sea, so famously known by the Name of _Magellans Straights_. It is a
large Countrey, and suppos’d not to be altogether barren of Metals; but
as yet no great Discovery hath been made of it, partly by reason of the
excessive Cold to which ’tis thought to be subject, and partly perhaps
by reason of the difficulty of the Enterprize, it being so far remote,
and very hardly passable in many places, by reason of the huge Mountains
the _Andes_, which bar it as it were against all Adventurers; but
chiefly by reason of the stoutness and untameableness of the _Araucanes_
and other Natives of _Chile_, through whose Countrey the March lieth,
and who must first be conquer’d, so that very little can be said more of
this Countrey, than onely to name the Ports and Places upon the
Sea-Coasts, at which the _Spaniards_, and likewise some other Nations at
several times have touched, the chief whereof upon the South Sea are, 1.
_Cabo de las Islas_, a Promontory or Foreland, twenty six Leagues
distant from that of _St. Felix_ on the Confines of _Chile_.

2. _Puerto de San Stephano_, fifty Leagues from that, towards the South.

3. _La Villa de Nuestra Sennora_, or _Our Ladies Dale_, a large and
secure Bay, eighteen Leagues Southward of _St. Stephens_.

4. _La Punta Deglada_; 5. _Puerto de los Reyos_; and 6. _Ancona Sin
Salida_, all of them opening towards the _Straights_. There is also at
the opening of the Straights, _Cabo de la Vittoria_, _Cabo Desseado_,
and some others.

Upon the North Sea, and up towards _Rio de la Plata_, the chief Places
observable, are 1. _Rio de la Crux_, and the Cape which they call _De
las Rameras_, about thirty Leagues distant from the _Straights_ Mouth.

2. The Bay of _St. Julian_, forty Leagues Northward of the former.

3. _El Puerto Desseado_; 4. _Puerto de los Leones_; 5. The Bay of
_Anegada_, all of them good and capacious Havens for the security of
Shipping upon these Coasts, and lying at a distance of thirty or forty
Leagues one from another, up towards _Rio de la Plata_, and the Countrey
of _Paraguay_, of which we are next to speak.

[Sidenote: Description of the _Magellan_ Straights.]

As for the Straights themselves, so much spoken of, and likewise so
necessary to be known by those who frequent these parts of the World,
they are a narrow Sea or Frith, by which the _Atlantick_ Ocean, or
rather some parts of it, doth fall into _Mare de Zur_, or the South Sea:
the Passage is long, running, as ’tis commonly suppos’d, well nigh a
hundred Leagues together, almost in a paralel Line, or in the same
Degree of Latitude from one end to the other; and likewise extreamly
difficult by reason of the many windings and turnings of the Sea, which
force them to be ever and anon altering of their Course, and a
mountainous high Countrey on both sides of it, from whence it is almost
continually beaten with Storms, both dangerous and terrible: They were
first discover’d by _Ferdinand Magellan_, by Nation a _Portuguese_, but
in the Service of the King of _Spain_, and by him nam’d _Magellan’s
Straights_; who although himself liv’d not to return into _Spain_, being
slain in the Conquest of the _Molucca_ Islands, yet his Companions did,
in the Ship call’d _Vittoria_, from whence the Cape _De la Vittoria_
abovesaid took its Name. The Mouth or Entrance of them, by the
_Atlantick_ Ocean, lies in fifty two Degrees of Southern Latitude, and
hath not above fifty three and some Minutes at the _Exit_ or opening
into the South Sea.

[Sidenote: The Straights of _Le Maire_.]

There is likewise since this, and but of late times, _viz._ about the
Year 1615. another _Straight_ discover’d by the _Dutch_, and call’d from
the Discoverer _Fretum Mairi_, or _The Straights of le Maire_, four or
five Degrees more to the Southward than those of _Magellan_, and
suppos’d to be a much earlier and safer Passage.

The Intention by the discovery of these _Straights_, was to have found a
shorter Way to the _East-Indies_ and the Kingdoms of _Cathay_ and
_China_, than that which was then onely us’d, _viz._ by the _Cape de
Buena Speranza_, and the Coast of _Africk_, but by reason of the great
difficulty, as ’tis to be suppos’d, and uncertainty of the Passage,
neither the one nor the other is much frequented, the _Spaniards_ for
the most part serving themselves of their _American_ Ports upon the
South Sea, from whence they make their Voyages and Returns to and from
the other _Indies_, and from thence home to _Spain_; and the _English_,
with other Nations of _Europe_, Trading still by the Coast of _Africk_
and _Cape of Good Hope_, or else by the way of _Alexandria_ and the
_Persian_ Gulf, as heretofore.

                     Paraguay, or Rio de la Plata.


We have seen in _Magellanica_ the farthest, that is, the most Southerly
part of the _New World_, and before it in order all the Western Coasts
of _America_ that lie either upon or towards _Mare del Zur_, _viz._,
from _Panama_, the first Province of this Southern part down as far as
the _Straights_. We are now to return and take a view of the Eastern
Coasts, and those Countreys which lie upon the _Atlantick_ Ocean,
steering our Course henceforth Northward, not directly, but as the Coast
leads us for a while Eastward and by North, forasmuch as the Land of
_America_, from the _Straights_ of _Magellan_ up as far as _Brasile_,
and almost to the _Æquator_, runneth out with a long Point, little less
than three thousand Leagues together.

[Sidenote: Situation and Description of _Paraguay_, or _Rio de la
           Plata_.]

The first Province we meet with on this side next to _Magellanica_, is
the Countrey of _Paraguay_, oftentimes call’d _Rio de la Plata_, from
the Name of an huge River, which runneth for the most part through the
midst of it: It is border’d, as we said, to the South and towards the
_Straights_ with _Magellanica_; on the East, with the _Atlantick_ Ocean;
more Northward, or to the North-East, it hath _Brasile_; and on the West
those undiscover’d Countreys of the Province of _Chile_, of which we
have spoken.

The Countrey on both sides the River is reported to be a very lusty and
fruitful Soil, bearing besides those which are proper and native, all
sorts of _European_ Fruits and Grain in great abundance, with
Sugar-Canes, both large and good, as any other Province of the _New
World_. Nor is it excell’d by any other for good Pasturage and great
Herds of Cattel, Sheep, and Swine; in particular, Horses are said to
have multiply’d so here, that of thirty Mares, and about six or seven
Stallions, which the _Spaniards_ left there, in forty years the whole
Countrey thereabouts was fill’d with the Breed of them, running wild in
great Companies together, through all the Woods and Forrests of the
Countrey, and being of excellent Mettle and Service if they could be
tam’d. It affordeth likewise great store of wild Deer and Stags, some
Lyons, Tygers, _&c._ nor is it without good Mines, some both of Gold and
Silver; but chiefly, as to what is yet discover’d, of Brass, and Iron;
and the People altogether salvage.

[Sidenote: The River _De la Plata_.]

The River _De la Plata_, which (as we said before) divides this
Countrey, is one of the largest of the whole World, rising, as ’tis
suppos’d, out of the Lake call’d _De los Xarayes_, three hundred Leagues
or more within Land, and falling into the _Atlantick_ Ocean, or North
Sea, in thirty four Degrees of Southern Latitude, with an _Estuary_ or
Mouth of thirty, or two and thirty Leagues over.

The whole Countrey is usually subdivided into three inferior Provinces,
which are 1. _Rio de la Plata_ properly so call’d. 2. _Tucuman._ 3. _La
Crux de Sierra._


                               SECT. II.
                  Rio de la Plata, properly so call’d.

[Sidenote: Situation of _Rio de la Plata_, properly so call’d.]

_Rio de la Plata_, properly so call’d, is that part of the Countrey
which extendeth it self on both sides the River, in length many Leagues
together, but not answerable in breadth.

[Sidenote: Towns and Places of note.]

The chiefest Towns of note in this Province, are 1. _Buenos Ayres_, by
some call’d _La Trinidad_, on the Southern Banks of the River _De la
Plata_, sixty four Leagues, as they say, from the Mouth of it: It is
seated commodiously at the foot of a little Mountain, and fortifi’d with
a Mud-Wall, a little Castle, and some Pieces of Ordnance.

2. _San Fe_, in English _St. Faiths_, fifty Leagues above _Buenos
Ayres_, upon the same River, and a richer Place, chiefly by reason of
their Cloth, of which there is here one of the greatest Manufactures of
all these parts of _Peru_.

3. _Nuestra Sennora de la Assumption_, commonly call’d _Assumption_
onely, lying yet higher up the River almost a hundred Leagues, a well
built and well frequented Town, long since inhabited by two hundred
Families at least of natural _Spaniards_, besides _Mestizos_, as they
call them, which are the Breed of _Spaniards_ by the _American_ People,
Men or Women, and _Mulattos_, which are likewise their Race, but
begotten upon _Negro_’s, of both which there are reckon’d to be here
some thousands.

4. _La Cividad Real_, or more commonly call’d _Ontiveros_, fourscore
Leagues Northward from _Assumption_, seated on the Banks of the River
_Parana_ in a fruitful Soil, as the Countrey generally is about all
these Places; but the Air hereabouts is not so healthful.

5. _St. Anne_, upon the same River; and 6. _St. Salvador._


                               SECT. III.
                                Tucuman.

[Sidenote: Situation of _Tucuman_.]

Westward of _La Plata_ lieth the Countrey of _Tucuman_, extending it
self as far as the Borders of _Chile_, a Countrey not yet well
discover’d either to the North or the South. That part of it which lieth
towards _Chile_ is well Manur’d and Husbanded, and likewise very
fruitful; but that towards _Magellanica_, neither the one, nor the
other, remaining altogether untill’d and barren.

[Sidenote: Towns and chief Places of note.]

The chief Towns and Places of note, are 1. _St. Jago de Esteco_, the
principal Town of the Province, and a Bishop’s See, seated upon the
River _Esteco_, a hundred and fourscore Leagues distant from _Buenos
Ayres_.

2. _St. Michael de Tucuman_, seated at the foot of a huge rocky
Mountain, but otherwise in a Soil the fruitfullest and best, both for
Corn and Pasturage, in all this Countrey, twenty eight Leagues distant
from _St. Jago_.

3. _Talavera_, or _Nuestra Sennora de Talavera_, as the _Spaniards_ call
it, situate upon the Banks of _Salado_, in a good Soil, and inhabited by
an industrious People, grown exceeding rich and wealthy, chiefly by
their Manufactures of Cotton-Wooll, whereof they have great plenty, and
by which they drive a Trade as far as the Mines at _Potosi_, and other
parts of _Peru_.

[Illustration: BRASILIA.]

4. _Corduba_, another rich Town of this Province, and of great Trade, as
lying at an equal distance, _viz._ of fifty Leagues, both From _San Fe_,
as they call it, or _St. Faiths_ in the Province of _La Plata_
abovesaid, and from _St. Juan de la Frontera_ in the Country of _Chile_,
and almost in the Road-way from _Potosi_ and those parts of _Peru_, to
_Buenos Ayres_ and the North Sea.

5. _Chocinoca_; 6. _Sococha_; 7. _Calebinda_; 8. _Morata_, and others,

                           La Crux de Sierra.

[Sidenote: Situation of _La Crux de Sierra_.]

_La Crux de Sierra_ is a little Territory (at least in comparison to
some others) lying towards _Peru_, and reckon’d by some for one of the
Provinces of _Peru_: It lieth betwixt the two great Rivers _Paraguay_
and _Guapay_, a hundred Leagues distant, as ’tis said, from _Charcas_,
to which yet in some Causes it is subordinate.

The Soil of this Countrey is abundantly fertile in all sorts of
_American_ Fruits, besides good plenty both of Wheat and _Maiz_, and
scarsity of nothing useful for Man’s Life, unless it be fresh Water in
some places.

[Sidenote: Chief Towns of this Province.]

The chief Towns of this Province, are 1. _San Crux_, situate at the foot
of a great Mountain or Hill, but opening upon a large Plain, whose
thirsty driness is well refresh’d by a certain Brook or Torrent, which
issueth out of a neighboring Mountain, and a few Leagues distant from
the Town maketh a pretty Lake, which supplieth the Countrey thereabouts,
both with fresh Water and Fish in good plenty.

2. _Barranea_, a Town suppos’d to be not above threescore Leagues
distant from _Potosi_.

3. _Nova Rioia_, once a Colony of _Spaniards_, but sack’d and spoil’d by
the Salvages of these Parts about the Year 1548. and the first
Discoverer of the Countrey, namely _Nunno de Chaves_, treacherously
murder’d by a Native, since which time ’tis said to have been deserted.

[Sidenote: Situation and Description of _Brasile_.]

[Sidenote: _Pedro Alvarez Capralis_ his Expedition to _Brasile_.]

_Brasile_ by _Capralis_ call’d _San Cruz_, because it was discover’d on
the Day dedicated to the holy Cross, but generally _Brasile_, from the
red Wood, which it produces in great abundance, extends, according to
the Account of the _Portuguese_, between the Rivers _Maranon_ and _De la
Plata_: But according to the Division which Pope _Alexander_ the Sixth
made upon the Approbation of the Kings of _Castile_ and _Portuguese_,
_Brasile_ extends not so far; for it begins in the North along the
Stream _Para_, and ends at the River _Capybora_, two Leagues beyond the
Town _St. Vincent_: Eastward it is wash’d by the Northern Ocean, and on
the West separated from _Peru_ by desolate Mountains: It lies between 4
and 22 Degrees of Southern Latitude. Historiographers differ much
concerning the first Discoverer; but without contradiction the first
honor belongs justly to _Americus Vesputius_, who being sent out by
_Ferdinand_, King of _Castile_, in the Year 1497. arriv’d first with
four Sail at _Brasile_; whither he was follow’d two years after by
_Vincent Aynez Pinzon_, Associate to _Christopher Columbus_; but with
ill success, for two of the Ships were cast away in a Storm, and the
other two return’d sadly weather-beaten into the _Spanish_ Haven
_Palos_, yet not before he had made a farther Discovery of _Brasile_
than _Americus Vesputius_; which so stirr’d up _Emanuel_, King of
_Portugal_, that he sent _Pedro Alvarez Capralis_ thither with five
hundred Men in thirteen Ships, that so he might get sure footing on
_Brasile_; where Landing he erected a Stone Cross, and inform’d the King
of his whole Proceedings by _Gasper Lemnius_, with whom he sent over two
_Brasilians_, a Man a Woman, the strangeness of whose Garb caus’d great
admiration in _Portugal_ amongst the Spectators: the Man, having a flat
Nose, went stark naked, and in his nether Lip hung a Stone call’d
_Matara_; through each Check there was stuck a piece of _Brasile_ Wood,
on his Shoulders he carry’d three long Darts, and on his Head he wore
divers colour’d Feathers; the Hair about his Privities was all pluckt
out, and his _Membrum Virile_ ty’d about with a String call’d
_Tacoaynhaa_, which he unty’d when he Urin’d; his Body was strong and
well proportion’d, and painted with several Colours. The Woman wore a
Lappet girt about her Middle, in which Girdle stuck a Cane Tobacco-pipe;
the Lappet reach’d just to the top of her Knees, the rest of her Body
was also naked; on her Head she wore a broad Hat made of Feathers, on
the top of which stuck two Plumes; in her Ears hung Bells, and about her
Neck three Strings of Pearl; and her Body was also painted with red and
yellow Colours. _Lemnius_ also gave so much Information concerning the
fruitfulness of _Brasile_, that several _Portuguese_ Families went
thither, accompanied with some _Italian_ Fryers, which scattering up and
down, began to build several Villages, but were soon after most of them
kill’d and eaten up by the _Indians_.

[Illustration]

_Anno 1549._ King _John_ the Third fitted out a great Fleet, which set
Sail from _Lisbon_ under the Command of _Thomas de Sosa_.

[Sidenote: _Jesuits_ sent to _Brasile_ by Pope _Paulus_ the Third and
           _Ignatius_.]

Also the Jesuits _Aspilcueta_, _Antonio Pireo_, _Leonardo Nonno_,
_Didaco Jacobo_, _Vincent Roderico_, and _Emanuel Robrega_, were sent
thither by Pope _Paulus_ the Third, and _Ignatius Loyola_, whose Fleet
came to an Anchor in the Bay afterwards call’d _Bahia de Todos Sanctos_,
where _Sosa_ built the City _Salvador_; since which the _Portuguese_
have spread themselves farther and farther over _Brasile_.

[Sidenote: Temperature of the Climate.]

The _United Netherlands_ also sent Colonies thither with good success,
for they took several vast Countreys from the _Portuguese_, by force of
Arms, and built new Forts and Towns in several places. But we will first
give you a general Description of it, that so we may the better render a
Relation in particular of every Province thereof, it being a
considerable part of the _New World_, and both pleasant and fruitful,
and the Sea-Coasts refresh’d by Easterly Winds, which begin before
Day-break, when the North Sea ebbs or flows, for then the Wind rises
with the Sun, and continues till Mid-night: Towards the West, where the
Mountains divide _Brasile_ from _Peru_, it is made temperate by Westerly
Winds, which though judg’d unwholsom, because they seem to arise out of
the Moorish Grounds, yet they hurt not the Inhabitants along that Coast,
because they either break against the high Mountains, or are driven by
the strong Wind which blows from the Sea.

The difference between Summer and Winter, shorter and longer Days, in
the main part of _Brasile_, is scarce discernable, warm Weather lasting
all the year round; and for the length of the Day and Night, the Sun
being hid under the Horizon twelve hours, shines for the most part just
as long, the greatest difference never being above an hour. Three hours
before Day-break the Dew makes it exceeding cold till Sun-rising;
wherefore the _Brasilians_ make Fires in the Night near their Hammocks,
not onely to keep wild Beasts from them, but also against the Cold.
After the coldest Nights follow the fairest Days, and the contrary after
sultry Nights; nevertheless (except in the rainy Season, which begins
with _March_ and ends about _August_) the Skye is generally clear, yet
it Lightens much towards the Evening. Rainbowes often appear in the
Skye, and bout the Moon _Halos_. The Rain generally falls in great
Drops, and with a mighty noise; before which it is generally very sultry
hot, or else soon after. The Dew, which is fruitfuller than in _Europe_,
is saltish, which makes it oft to rot things that lie in the open Air.
During the rainy Moneths, a South-East Winds blows from a cloudy Skye,
much stronger than the Northern in Summer. The South-East Wind drives
the Stream to the North, as the North Wind drives it to the South: And
more than this, there is little to be discern’d of the Seas ebbing and
flowing hereabouts: At the highest Tides the _Brasilians_ go several
Leagues from the Shore to Fish, upon Planks made of the spungy Wood
call’d _Jangada_ fastned together. The Sea, which seems to burn in the
Night, is so clear in the Day, that the Fish may be seen to swim above
twenty Fathom deep. A calm Ocean when the Days and Nights are of an
exact length, and especially when dark Clouds appear, is a certain sign
of a dreadful Storm. At Full or New-Moon the Sea rises twelve Foot, and
continues either a longer or shorter time, according as it is more or
less turbulent, and the Rivers fall stronger or more gently into the
same.

Before most part of the Coast of _Brasile_ lies a Stone Cliff of above
twenty or thirty Paces broad, which is never cover’d with Water, though
in the time of Spring-floods. In this Cliff Nature in several places
hath made a Gap, through which the Ships sail near the Shore, and ride
safe at an Anchor.

The whole Countrey of _Brasile_ is divided into thirteen _Præfectures_,
or Lordships, and hath about as many Rivers, which more or less empty
themselves into every one of these Countreys. The Eastern part hath
several Brooks and Fountains, which afford good Water both for Man and
Beast. In some parts the Water is so strong, that the wild Beasts making
themselves Drunk therewith, are easily taken. During the Winter Season
the Rivers glide with great force, and swell on a sudden, overflowing
all the neighboring Countrey, onely the River _San Francisco_ runs
strongest and rises highest in the Summer Season, whenas in the Winter
it flows low, and poures but little Water into the Ocean. The original
of this River is as yet unknown, yet is by most believ’d to come out of
a great Lake lying near the _Peruvian_ Mountains: The _Hollanders_, who
sail’d forty Leagues up the same, found it every where broad and deep,
and scatter’d full of Isles and Rocks. The _Portuguese_ sailing ten
Leagues farther, discover’d the great Rocks _Cocoeras_, from which the
said River falls down with great violence, and extends it self
North-West. In the other _Brasilian_ Streams, though wide at the
Mouthes, which generally are not above two or three hours walking from
their Fountains or Springs, no Barque is able to Row up, they being
exceeding shallow, although much Rain falls into them; the reason
whereof is because the barren Mountains lying between _Brasile_ and
_Peru_, discharge abundance of Water through the Rivers of _Amazones_,
_Maranon_, _Francisco_, _La Plata_, and the _Juaeiro_, with such force
into the Ocean, that they keep their sweetness for thirty Leagues. Near
the Sea side are several Lakes and Pits which are drinkable, and others
up in the Countrey that are brackish.

[Sidenote: The Nature of the Soil.]

The Countrey differs exceedingly, for where it extends in Plains the
Soil is fat and clayie, and produces all sorts of Fruit, but especially
Sugar-Canes. During the rainy Seasons the Trees flourish most; after
which the heat of the Sun, and fertility of the Soil speedily ripen the
Fruit: wherefore they Dung not their Land, but on the contrary endeavor
to make it lean with Sand, that the Plants might not have too many
Leaves, and wither before the Fruit can be ripened. They Sowe in the
beginning of the rainy Moneths, and especially take care that the Seed
lie not too deep in the Ground, because then the Sun-beams being not
able to come at it, suffer it to perish in the cold Ground.

The high _Cocoa_ and _Palmito_-Trees, are transplanted all the year
round, the Roots being onely cover’d with a little Earth, because they
can endure no cold.

Several Trees here bear a cooling Fruit, as if kind Nature took care to
provide against excessive heat.

[Sidenote: Description of the _Tamanda_.]

All manner of Plants and Herbs brought hither from _Angola_, _Portugal_,
the _Netherlands_, and the _East-Indies_, grow here very plentifully.
But the Countrey generally would be much better, if some way could be
found out to destroy the innumerable company of Pismires, which though
three times bigger than the _European_, resemble them very much, and
cover the Paths in Woods and Fields for three or four Miles together;
and raising Hillocks, make them hollow, and fill them with Corn: in the
Full of the Moon they gather an incredible quantity of Grain, which they
bite at each end, because it should not sprout: against the rainy
Moneths they stop up their Holes, that the Water may not damnifie their
Store. But these Animals have a mortal Enemy of the _Tamanda_, of which
there are two sorts, the bigger call’d _Guaca_; the lesser _Miri_; the
_Guaca_, notwithstanding it is no bigger than an ordinary Dog, yet it
destroys Tygers, and other wild Beasts, with such a raging fury, that it
never lets go what once it hath got hold of, but holds it fast so long
till sometimes it dies of Hunger. The _Guaca_ differing from the _Miri_
onely in bigness, hath a broad Tail full of grey and black Bristles,
which sticks up when he is vex’d, but when he goes to sleep, covers
himself with the same. The _Miri_ winds his long smooth Tail about the
Boughs, by which hanging he searches the Holes in the Trees with his
Tongue, which being thin and round, hath a Gutter in the middle, in
which when it feels any Pismires, it suddenly swallows them down: If he
perceives them to have their Nests under Ground, then he scratches up
the Earth, and puts his Tongue in at the Holes. Both the _Guaca_ and
_Miri_ have a thick Skin, and a broad black Streak from their Breasts on
each side up half way their Bodies, and through the black runs also a
white Streak. No Beast in the World is hardier than this, for though it
fasts twelve days, and is afterwards flay’d alive, yet it will live
several hours after.

[Sidenote: The Plant _Manyle_.]

[Sidenote: Description of the Tree _Ibriptanga_.]

[Sidenote: The Tree _Tatai-iba_.]

The Lakes in _Brasile_ are for the most part overgrown with Weeds just
like a Field, yet are exceeding full of Fish and Fowl. Where the Sea
runs into the Lakes, great multitudes of Crabs are seen crawling along
the Ground, and the Oysters hang in Clusters on the Boughs of a Plant
call’d _Manyle_ or _Mangues_, which grow with their Roots either near or
in the Water, in such a manner, that new Bodies still shoot from the old
Roots, which prevents easie access to the chief Plant, on whose
uppermost Leaves after Sun-rising sticks very white Salt, which in the
Night, or in a cloudy Day turns to a brackish Dew. Moreover, those
places where _Brasile_ rises with Hills and Mountains, are likewise very
fruitful, except the barren tops of some, which seem to kiss the Skyes;
and though the fruitful Mountains flourish in the time of the rainy
Months, yet many of the Trees which grow on them die in Summer, and
their Ashes being burnt by the Inhabitants, are us’d in stead of Dung.
Some Woods extend themselves three hundred Leagues in length, and are
full of Trees, so tall, that an Arrow shot upwards falls short of the
top of them, and a Boat may be made out of the Body, which can carry a
hundred and fifty Men. On the great Boughs of these mighty Trees grow
other excrescent Shrubs after the manner of Misseltoe, which proceed
from the Kernels swallow’d and muted upon them by the Birds that light
there. In some places also grow also Sweet-wood Trees, which afford
either excellent Gums or Wood to Dye with; amongst which the chief is
the _Ibiripitanga_, which yields the _Brasile_ Wood, that gives
Denomination of _Brasile_ to this vast Tract of Land. The Tree
_Ibripitanga_ is tall and spreading, hath sad colour’d Bark full of
short Thorns; the Leaves are green, and differ in form but little from
the Box-Tree Leaf; the Boughs shoot forth other lesser, full of yellow
and sweet-smelling Flowers, which falling off are succeeded by a flat
long Cod, of a dark grey colour, full of little red Pulse; the upper
part of the Tree is not good to Dye with, but onely the lower part of
the Body, which because the Tree grows far up in the Countrey, is not
transportable without much trouble. But the _Tatai-iba_ grows in the
Woods along the Shore; the Bark being of an Ash-colour, invests a yellow
Wood; the Leaves are sharp and notch’d, the Fruit not unlike Mulberries,
pale, juicy, and full of white Seed; the Wood boyl’d Dyes a pure Yellow.
It is observable not onely of this Tree, but generally of the Trees of
this Countrey, that they neither flourish, nor shed their Leaves all
over at once, nor do several Trees of the same kind, and growing here
germinate or fade together; for whilest one is fullest of Blossoms, the
other is without Leaves; and whilest the same Tree sheds its Leaves on
one side, the other side is newly Budded.

The _European_ Plants and Herbs with soft Roots, being once Planted in
_Brasile_, come to be hard and lignifi’d. There is also great
difference, according to the Ground in which they are Planted; for such
Plants and Trees as in the Plains are but small and tender, grow ten
times higher if Planted in the Woods.

All sorts of _Indian_ Pulse grow higher than the tallest Trees, like
high Arbors, under which both Men and Beasts may shelter themselves from
the Sun or Rain.

We find not upon Record or Tradition, that _Brasile_ was ever troubled
with an Earthquake, which is the reason that it hath neither Silver nor
Gold-Mines, because sulphurous Fires are found under Ground, which are a
cause of the production of Gold and Silver, so likewise they occasion
Earthquakes: yet in that part of _Brasile_ call’d _Ceara_, there are
some Mines of Silver, out of which the _Hollanders_ would have got
greater Riches, had not they been employ’d in the Wars against the
_Portuguese_.

[Illustration]

Far up into the Countrey amongst the Mountains, inhabit _Canibals_, or
Man-eaters. The _Europeans_ that first travell’d that way, found the
Countrey very fertile and full of People, especially in the Valleys, but
somewhat incommoded by the want of Water, and the excessiveness of the
Heat in the Day, and of the Cold in the Night. In some places the
Countrey is so over-grown with Brambles, that they are forc’d to cut
their way through the same. But there are a sort of Thistles, which
having concave Leaves, receive the Dew and Rain for the accommodation of
the Natives.

Besides Serpents and Dragons, the Tygers are most of all to be fear’d
when hungry, but once satisfi’d are easily taken.

Dogs, Oxen, Sheep, and Horses thrive also exceedingly in most parts of
_Brasile_.

[Sidenote: The Nature of the _Brasilians_.]

The _Brasilians_ live to be very old without being Bald or Grey: There
are seldom or never to be seen squint-ey’d, lame, decrepid, or any
deformed People, notwithstanding the Children are never Swath’d but
thrown into cold Water as soon as born. The Men generally have a very
near resemblance one with another, as also the Women, so that there is
not such a difference betwixt Man and Man there, as amongst other
People. There is scarce any Sickness heard of in these Parts; for
besides a long Life, they enjoy the benefit of Health so long as they
live. They trouble not themselves with much Business; and in one Hut,
whose Covering consists of Palm-Leaves, dwell several Families together.

[Sidenote: Their manner of Living.]

[Sidenote: Their several sorts of Drinks.]

The general Bread of the _Brasilians_ is the stamp’d Root _Mandihoka_;
besides which they also eat all manner of Fruit and Plants, and many
times Flesh, which they either eat boyl’d, broyl’d, or stew’d; their
Boyling is after this manner: First they kindle their fire with two
Sticks, the one of hard, and the other of soft Wood; the hard they make
sharp at the end, and fix the same into the soft, which setting on fire
they immediately lay Cotton thereupon, or else dry Leaves, and so boyl
the Flesh in round Earthen Pots call’d _Camu_: but they account that
better which is stew’d in a Pot, the bottom whereof is cover’d with
Leaves, on which they lay the Flesh, then stopping the same close on the
top with Earth and Leaves, they make Fire over it so long till they
think the Flesh to be sufficiently stew’d. Their Broyling they perform
by fixing forked Sticks into the Ground, over which they lay several
others like a Gridiron; and upon them the raw Flesh, cut in long Slices,
and Pepper’d and Salted, then make a Fire under the same till it is
enough; and their Meat so dress’d keeps good fourteen days. Their Fish
either boyl’d or broyl’d is eaten with the Sawce _Juquitinga_. The
little Fish _Piaba_ and _Piquitinga_ they make up in Rolls, and lay them
under hot Ashes. Both with their Flesh and Fish they eat for Bread, as
hath been said, the Meal of the Root _Mandihoka_, which they taking up
with three Fingers throw into their Mouthes so dexterously, that not the
least scrap falls besides. They never observe any set hours to eat, for
they make several Meals in the Day, and sometimes in the middle of the
Night, if their Appetite serves, and neither drink nor speak whilest
they are at their Meat. They sleep in spread Hammocks made fast between
two Poles, near which burns a constant Fire with which in the Day-time
they dress their Meat, and at Night keep themselves warm, the Nights
being there somewhat cold, because of their equal length with the Days.
Their usual Liquor is cold Water, taken out of the Fountains, Rivers, or
Brooks; but to Carouse they make the Drink _Caoi_, of the Fruit of the
_Ocaiiba_-Tree, which being stamp’d in a woodden Mortar, is strain’d,
and at first looks like Milk, but after a few days standing turns to a
darker colour, and is strong enough to make Astronomers of those that
drink largely of it, but if long kept, it turns to be excellent Vinegar.

They have another Drink call’d _Aipu_, which is made two several ways;
the first is thus: An old Toothless Woman chews the little cut Root
_Aipimacaxera_ to a Pap call’d _Caracu_, which spitting in a Pot they
pour Water on the same, and afterwards boyling it leisurely, stirring it
all the time it stands over the Fire. The other way of making this
_Aipu_, which is much the more cleanly, is to boyl the said Root so
long, till it comes to be like Butter-milk, and then letting it stand
till it hath done working, it will be no unpleasant Drink.

Another sort of Drink amongst them is their _Pacobi_, made of the Fruit
of the Tree _Pacobehe_ and _Pacobucu_; besides others made of the Tree
_Abatu_, of _Indian_ Barley and _Maiz_. Also their Liquor call’d
_Jetici_ is press’d out of _Potato_-Roots.

In like manner the Plant _Nana_, by the _Portuguese_ call’d _Ananas_,
makes the Drink _Nanai_, which is exceeding strong and heady, but good
against Faintness, Vomiting, Gravel, and stoppage of Urine, as also
against Poyson.

[Sidenote: Their Deboches.]

The _Tapuiyans_, sur-named _Cariri_, meet at a certain time to make the
Liquor _Aipu_, whereof each takes as much to his Hut as falls to his
share, and when it hath done working, they begin in the Morning very
early at the first House in the Village, and drink out every drop which
they find there, and so from House to House till they have drunk one
another drie; and he is look’d upon to be the best Man that hath drunk
and evacuated most.

[Sidenote: Their manner of Taking Tobacco.]

The _Brasilians_ take generally very strong Tobacco, which they first
drie in the Sun, and afterwards before the Fire, the better to rub it in
pieces: Their Tobacco-pipe is a Cane and a hollow Nut cut off at the
top, and a round Hole bor’d in the middle, into which they put the Cane.
They forbear not to take Tobacco even in the midst of their religious
Ceremonies, which are perform’d with Singing and Dancing in this manner:

[Sidenote: Their religious Ceremonies.]

The _Tapuiyans_ making a round Ring at an equal distance one from
another, all of them being stark naked, tie divers colour’d Plumes of
Feathers on their back-sides with a String made fast on their left
Shoulders and about their Wastes; about their Legs they have Cotton
Garters; each in his turn bowing to the Left, stretches down his left
Hand to the Ground, and puts his right Hand in between the Strings which
tie the Plume of Feathers, and stamps continually with his right Foot,
whilest all the rest begin to Sing a doleful Song, which by degrees they
change into a merry one, not without some appearance of understanding
the Art of Musick. Their Songs contain first a mournful Relation of a
general Deluge, which drowned their Predecessors, all but some few, who
escap’d by climbing up high Trees and Mountains; next the Acts of those
old Heroes from whom they boast themselves Extracted, who lost their
Lives, or valiantly fought for the publick good, and were rewarded with
the enjoyment of all pleasures and Delights, of Singing, Playing,
Dancing, and the like, in a remote Countrey, whither after their Deaths
they hope to be translated: Whilest they thus Sing over all their Songs,
three Priests stand in the middle of the Ring, each holding the Idol
_Maraka_ (in their left Hand) resembling an old Ostritch’s Egg stuck
full of Feathers on the top: about their Wastes they wear a Girdle of
rich Plumes, on their Heads also a Crown of Feathers; the middle Priest
looks with a stern Countenance, and holds up his left Leg from the
Ground, whilest the other two standing on each side of him, hold in
their right Hands a Pipe, out of which blowing Tobacco-smoak in one
anothers Faces, they utter these words, _Receive the Spirit of heroick
Strength_: The Dance ended, they Entertain their Priests with Meat and
Drink eight days together, and also put Meat before their Idol _Maraka_,
who is the chief Deity they adore.

[Illustration]

[Sidenote: Their Arms.]

Their Arms consist of Bowes made of hard Wood, Strung with twisted
Cotton Thred; their Arrows they make of the Cane _Tacaara_, made very
sharp at the end, or headed with some Beasts sharp Tooth, or pointed
with the Bones of the Fish _Iperu_. Some of the _Tapuiyans_ use great
Darts, and long Clubs of black Wood, broad before, and full of sharp
Spikes; the Handles being wound about with Cotton Strings call’d
_Jatirana_, under which hangs a Tuft of the Bird _Arara_’s Feathers, as
also about the middle. Their Trumpets, call’d _Canguenca_, are the
Shin-bones of Men, though they have others also made of great Shells and
Canes. They us’d to be continually at War one with another, which they
wag’d neither for Lands nor Riches, but either to make themselves
eminent, and to be accounted valiant Soldiers, or most especially for
the sake of Man’s-flesh to feed upon, which they love beyond all things
in the World, wherefore they fatten all their Prisoners for the
slaughter. Their Battels are always cruel, for they fight very
desperately. _Emanuel de Moraes_ relates, That he saw a _Brasilian_
fight with three Armed _Portugueses_, who slew him not till after he had
wounded them all three.

[Sidenote: The Languages of the _Brasilians_.]

The Languages of the _Brasilians_ are several, each Countrey speaking a
peculiar Tongue, but so different that they cannot understand one
another. The _Tabuyans_ are divided into above eighty Tribes, each
speaking a peculiar Language, which have no resemblance one with
another; nevertheless they have a general Language which is understood
by most of them. The Jesuit _Joseph Anchieta_ publishing a _Brasilian_
Dictionary in _Conimbrica_, _Anno 1595._ shewed that the fore-mention’d
Language wants the Letters _f_, _l_, _s_, _z_, _r_, and hath no double
Consonants in any word, except _mb_, _nd_, _ng_, so that the sound of
the word falls generally on the last Vowel. The fore-mention’d _Moraes_
well experienc’d in the _Brasilian_ Tongue, writ an Alphabet of all the
most familiar words thereof us’d in common Discourse, of which it will
not be unnecessary to give this following Extract:

 A.

 _Anga_, the Soul.
 _Angabara_, Lean.
 _Angaipata_, Angry, _or_ Wicked.
 _Angaturama_, Thankful, _or_ Acceptable.
 _Apara_, a Crown.
 _Apecum_, the Tongue.
 _Apicaba_, a Stool.
 _Ara_, the Time, Skye, _or_ Day.
 _Ara-ibi coquime_, Noon.
 _Araya_, Grandmother.

These are of the most usual words of the general Language in _Brasile_,

peculiar Tongue, as hath been said, of which the chiefest and most
eminent are the _Tupinambu_, _Tabaiaras_, _Potigi-iguaras_, _Marhuites_,
_Waimoores_, _Tomonimenos_, _Waitaquazes_, _Wainasses_, _Topinaques_,
_Pories_, _Molopaques_, _Motaias_, _Biheros_, _Wainawasons_, _Tamoies_,
_Tocomans_, and the _Cariogs_; of all which the _Tupinambu_ are the most
comely, especially their Women, which (according to the testimony of the
aforesaid _Emanuel Moraes_, an Eye-witness) may stand in competition
with the _European_ Beauties. These Women accompany their Husbands when
they go into the Wars, and carry their Provisions, especially store of
Tobacco. In the Lips both of the Men and Women hang little Stones. The
Men take as many Wives as they please; and amongst the generality of the
fore-mention’d Nations, there is scarce any sign of Religion to be
discern’d.

[Sidenote: The _Tobaras_ and _Potigi-iguaras_.]

The _Tobaras_ are accounted the best Horsemen; but in Singing and
Discourse, the _Potigi-iguaras_ exceed all the other _Brasilians_: They
place twenty or thirty Singers in a Row, which observing Time, Sing the
Transactions of their Predecessors with good Voices.

[Sidenote: The _Waimoores_.]

The _Waimoores_ are a strong People that inhabit the large Tract of Land
between _Bahia_ and _Isleos_, and having well timber’d Bodies, can keep
pace with a Horse running full speed. Five or six of them often set upon
a Sugar-Mill, though a hundred Men be at work in the same: They are all
over bedaub’d with Dirt, because they lie like Beasts on the Ground:
They wear long Hair, and have no certain Abodes.

[Sidenote: The _Tomonimenos_.]

The _Tomonimenos_, living about _Spirito Santo_, are more civilis’d;
they make Walls of Stone about their Huts; and these Walls are full of
Holes, through which they shoot Arrows at those that Invade them; their
Bodies are Painted red and black, and cover’d with Feathers. The
_Portuguese_ taking sixteen thousand of them Prisoners at once, kill’d
most of them, and destroy’d the Countrey all along the River _Paraiva_.

[Sidenote: The _Waitaquazes_.]

At the South and North Point of _Cape Frio_ dwell the _Waitaquazes_,
bigger and stronger than the _Waimoores_; and they also sleep like Hogs
on the Ground about a Fire, hold all People for their Enemies, and their
Flesh for the greatest Dainty. The Women Arm’d with Bowes and Arrows
stand by their Husbands in Battel.

[Sidenote: The _Wainasses_.]

[Sidenote: The Description of the Plant _Vruca_.]

On _Isla Grande_ reside the _Wainasses_, a little People, which have
very long Bellies, go stark naked, shave the Crown of their Heads, and
let the other part of their Hair hang down long on their Shoulders. The
Women, which are of gross Bodies, colour themselves Red with _Vruca_,
which is a wild Plant, but much us’d amongst them: the Kernels are
inclos’d in Husks full of red Fibres. These Kernels are not onely mix’d
with the other Ingredients of the _Chocaletta_ Drink, but also us’d to
Dye of a red Colour: The Wood of this Plant is very white, and the Bark
grey, like the Hazle; the Leaves being of a deep Green, resemble a
Heart; at the end of the Boughs grow several Blossoms, each as big as a
Rose, consisting of five Leaves, partly red and partly white, in the
middle whereof are yellowish Threds with purple Points, which give
little or no smell: after the Flower follows the Fruit, two Fingers
long; when it begins to be ripe it grows still redder and redder, each
Cod containing thirty or forty round Kernels, which being touch’d leave
a red tincture upon the Fingers; the Cod when ripe opens of it self, and
shews the Kernels speckled white, which dry’d, pounded, and mix’d with
Piss, Dye so strong a Red, that Linnen dipt into the same will never
receive any other Colour. This Root also boyl’d in Broth, makes it not
onely red, but gives it a pleasant taste.

[Sidenote: The _Topinaques_.]

The _Topinaques_, which dwell about _St. Vincent_, are a strong and
gross People, go stark naked both Men and Women: when they kill any of
their Enemies they Paint themselves with the Fruit _Janipano_, put a
great Plume of Feathers on their Head, and two Sticks in their Mouths,
Dancing with strange motions of the Body, inclining sometimes towards
the right, and sometimes towards the left side, for three day together;
during which time they drink a filthy kind of Liquor. The Women, who
have well proportion’d Bodies, onely covering their Heads with a Cap,
about which they tie a bread of Hair, to which a square Basket being
fastned, hangs below their Backs when they travel.

[Sidenote: The _Pories_.]

The Mountains along the Ocean, which inclose much Gold, are inhabited by
the _Pories_, a peaceable People, molesting none of their Neighbors;
they sleep in Nets of Flags, and have no other Houses than three Poles
plac’d triangular, and cover’d with Palm-Leaves; they feed on Pine-Nuts
and _Eyrires_, Apples that have Shells like a Walnut, and have also the
precious Balsam-Oyl in great abundance.

[Sidenote: The _Molopaques_.]

Along the River _Paradiva_ inhabit the _Molopaques_; the Men strong and
well timber’d, have Beards long enough to cover their Privities. The
Women also fair, modest, prudent, and never laughing, tie their Hair,
painted with several colours, round about their Middle with a Cord, so
that it serves in stead of an Apron. They observe a set-hour for Dinner
and Supper, which is not us’d by any other _Brasilians_. The Mountains
in these Parts consisting of a black Mold, have plenty of Gold, but it
is of no esteem or regard amongst them, onely that which is wash’d down
by the Rain they gather up, but put to no other use than to make Hooks
to hang their Nets on.

[Illustration]

[Sidenote: The _Motayas_.]

The _Motayas_, being of a low Stature and brown Complexion, shave off
the Hair of their Heads, or else pluck it up by the Roots; they are
eaters of Man’s-flesh.

Not far from whose Dominions appear the Mountains _Pinos_ up in the
Countrey, which abounding with Gold and Precious Stones, are inhabited
by the _Biheros_, otherwise call’d _Lopos_, which live under the Trees
like Beasts.

[Sidenote: The _Waianawasons_.]

[Sidenote: The _Tamoyes_.]

The _Waianawasons_ have little Villages, built along a nameless River;
they are a Gigantick People, but very ignorant. Thirteen _Portuguese_
undertaking some years ago to travel through this Countrey to the South
Sea, found on some Mountains abundance of Gold and Precious Stones; and
amongst many strange things they saw a Crystal Mountain ten days before
they came near it, over which they could not travel because of its
steepness; at the foot thereof sprung a broad Stream, making a great
noise. From thence travelling forward, they came to the _Tamoyes_
Countrey, the Men whereof, being well proportion’d, wore great Bunches
of Feathers on their Heads: The Women, exceeding fair, had carv’d
Breasts. The said _Portuguese_ being taken here, were put into Prison,
and all slain and eaten, excepting one, who escap’d after this manner:
Thirty thousand _Tamoyes_ falling into the Countrey of the _Amazons_, by
the _Americans_ call’d _Mandiocuysyams_, made a great Feast with three
hundred of them, whilest the rest fled to the River _La Plata_, where
they got help from the _Portuguese_, who kill’d ten thousand of the
_Tamoyes_, made the rest Slaves, and releas’d their imprison’d
Countreyman.

[Sidenote: The _Tocomans_, _Caryogs_, and _Maraquites_.]

The _Tocomans_, a little People, dwell between _La Plata_ and _St.
Vincent_.

The _Caryogs_ possess much Gold and Precious Stones.

The _Maraquites_, by the Western _Indians_ sur-named _Tapuiyers_, that
is, _Wild People_, are divided into seventy six sorts, all differing in
their Languages; amongst which the chiefest are the _Arodera_, _Cajau_,
_Maquaru_, and _Poyme_, which all live without Law, Religion, setled
Abodes, or Friendship with any Neighbors; and the Women Fight as well as
the Men. _Jacob Rabbi_, who dwelt a considerable time, and convers’d
amongst these People, describes their Customs thus:

[Sidenote: Their Customs describ’d.]

“Their King _Jandui_, sir-named _Otshicayayna_, from the River which
flows through the Countrey of the _Tapuyans_, causes (it he thinks fit)
to be publish’d through the whole Camp of the Enemy, whither he will go
the next Morning, and what he will do all the Day following, having
first consulted with his Council of Sorcerers. Before they march they
wash their Bodies in the River; rub themselves all over with Sand, and
afterwards wash it off again, then stretch themselves till all their
Joynts crack, run to the Fire, and when throughly warm, scratch their
Bodies with certain Fish-Teeth, insomuch that the Blood gushes out of
several places, all which they judge to be good against wearisomness.
About a Stones-cast from the King’s Tent lie two thick Logs, a large
Stride one from the other, against which the whole Multitude stand
divided into two Parties, each of whom chuse the strongest Man accounted
amongst them to carry the Log for a Wager, and when these two are tir’d,
they are releas’d by others, and he that comes last to the appointed
place with the Log, is laugh’d at by the Party to which he belong’d that
was there first, where they all stay for the Youths that bring their
Arms, which when they have deliver’d, they all fall to work, cutting
down Trees, breaking off the Boughs, sticking them in the Ground, and
tying them together on the top for Tents, which are built in rows one
against another, leaving a broad Path between. Mean while the Women and
Children coming with their Baggage, the Men run to Fish and Hunt, or to
seek Honey. The old Women dig up Roots, which stamp’d serve them for
Bread, whilest the young Women help one another to prepare the Meat in
the Huts. Moreover the Men spend their time in several Exercises, as
Wrestling and Running, of which two Women, appointed for that purpose,
are the Judges. When the Evening draws on upon them, then the Youths
dividing themselves into Companies, go Singing from one Tent to another,
and are follow’d by the Maids Dancing and Leaping, every one standing
behind him whom she loves best; and this is look’d upon as a singular
sign of affection. When a young Man is inclin’d to Marry, he carries
Honey and Venison to his Mistresses Father, who if he hath more than one
Daughter acquaints the Soothsayers with it, who inform the King
concerning it; he then causes all the young Men and Maids to be call’d
together out of the Camp, sends them into the Woods to Hunt out a wild
Beast, which they no sooner see, but they return and acquaint the
Multitude therewith, who immediately surrounding the Place, soon catch
the Beast, whose Entrails they pull out and throw to the Dogs, and give
the Flesh to the Women to roast, which when ready they make merry with,
Singing and Dancing after they have eaten; then if the Youth hath
behav’d himself well in pursuing of the wild Beast, the King grants him
the Maid which he desires for his Wife: Four days before the Wedding
they bore a Hole through each of the Bridegrooms Cheeks with a sharp
piece of Wood, which done they solemnize the Marriage; at which the King
himself distributes the Meat to every Guest as he thinks fit; after
Dinner they extol the Mothers Care, in preserving her Daughters
Virginity for the Bridegroom in strange Songs. If a Maid be
Marriageable, and no Suitor comes to her, then the Mother draws red
Strokes under her Eyes, and conducts her to the King, who sets the Maid
down by him on a Mat, warms his Hands against the Fire, then stroaks
himself and the Maid, and also blows Tobacco-Smoak on her and himself,
which done, he performs the part of a Husband with her. But their making
Holes through their Ears and Lips is done whilest they are Children,
after this manner: The Boys who undergo this Ceremony, come to the Place
appointed, where the whole Multitude Dance and Sing, and the Conjurers
(who are the onely Priests they have) sit in two rows opposite to one
another; one of them starting up, takes a Boy by the Head, ties him Hand
and Foot that he cannot stir at all; which done, a second Sorcerer comes
to his assistance, and with a sharp-pointed Stick bores Holes through
his Ears and Lips, whilest the Mother of the Boy makes a sad
Lamentation. Women refuse to have any familiarity with their Husbands as
soon as they perceive themselves to be with Child; and as soon as any
Woman is Deliver’d, she runs into a neighboring Wood, where with a Shell
she cuts off the Childs Navel, which boyling she eats with the
After-birth; then washes her self and the Child every Morning and
Evening in cold Water; as long as she gives Suck her Husband lies not
with her, unless it be a Man that hath but one Wife. If a Woman commit
Adultery, her Husband beats her out of his House, but if he takes her in
the Act, it is lawful for him to kill both. In the middle of the King’s
Tent stands a great _Calabash_ full of Stones call’d _Kehnturah_,
cover’d with the corner of a Mat, which none dares approach without the
King’s leave, unless it be to smoak the same with Tobacco, or to lay
Venison or Honey before it.”

[Sidenote: Strange manner of curing the Sick amongst the _Tapuyans_.]

It is also remarkable how the Sorcerers deal with their Sick; the
aforesaid _Jacob Rabbi_, in Eye-witness relates, That the King _Drarugh_
being extreamly troubled with pains in his Sides and Legs, and finding
no help amongst his Sorcerers, who pretended to be Physicians, went to
the neighboring King of the _Tapuyans_, where three undertook to cure
him, which they did after this manner: One of them blew Tobacco-smoak on
his Body, suck’d his Knees, roar’d like a Lyon, and after much ado
vomited a little Eel into his Hand, which he pretended had put the King
to so much pain; whilest the second suck’d his Belly, and also roar’d
exceedingly, and vomited forth at last a Stone, on which appear’d a
Rose; the third suck’d his left Side, till he vomited something like a
Root; after which the King is said immediately to have recover’d.

[Sidenote: Their Feasting in honor of the Stars.]

There is but little Ceremony of Religion to be found amongst the
_Tapuyans_, onely they shew Reverence to the Seven-stars when the Fruits
of the Field are ripe, after this manner: First they spend three days in
Dancing and Singing, then the Youths prepare themselves to Fight with
Lances and Clubs, tie tough Twigs about their Legs, pour Honey on their
Heads, tie their Hair behind in Knots after it is powder’d with red
Powder, Paint their Faces and Bodies with several Colours, stick a long
Feather in their Necks betwixt their Hair, and on their Heads set
Garlands of red Feathers pleited, down their Backs hang Bundles of
Branches like Tails, and have their Arms adorn’d with the Wings of the
Bird _Kosetug_; thus dress’d they fight three days, at the end whereof
the Conquerors shew great joy.

It deserves special observation what the Learned _Gerard Vossius_
relates of them from the Mouth of _Christopher Arcisseusky_, a _Polish_
Nobleman, famous for his heroick Exploits for the _United Netherlands_
in _Brasile_.

[Sidenote: _Arcisseusky_’s Relation of the Manners of the new Married.]

“The _Tapuyans_ (saith he) are a People that range up and down, never
staying long in one place, between _Siara_ and _Meranthon_, a vast Tract
of Land, and go almost naked, having onely a slight Covering about their
Middle. When the _Hollanders_ gave them Clothes, they admir’d the
strange Fashion thereof, and after two days return’d them again: In
their Lips, Nostrils, Ears and Cheeks they hung Ornamentals of Wood,
Bones, Feathers, or Stones; a great Club, and a strong Bowe made of hard
Wood serve them for Arms; Gold and Silver they esteem’d not, wherefore
they barter’d whole Chests full (buried there by the _Portuguese_ and
discover’d by them) with the _Hollanders_ for Greyhounds: They judge
themselves to be better than other Man-eaters, because they eat not the
Flesh of their Enemies, but of their own Relations, and those neither
kill’d in the Wars, nor dying a natural Death; by which they pretend to
express their exceeding love to the Deceased, who else would, say they,
be eaten by the Worms and rot, wherefore they rather chuse to eat them,
that they may receive the nourishment themselves.”

[Illustration]

The same Author relates also, That he saw a _Tapuyan_ yield up the Ghost
not far from the Castle _Rio Grande_, after which his nearest Relations
taking the Body, wash’d the same, together with the Entrails, and
cutting the Corps into several pieces, roasted the same on a Spit,
preserving the Fat that dropt from it in Pans, and eat the Flesh with a
greedy Appetite. None were admitted to this Feast but his chief
Relations; and that which they could not eat, as the Hair, Teeth, Nails,
and Bones, they burnt to Ashes, which gathering up they mix’d with their
Liquor till it was all drunk up.

[Sidenote: The Religion of the _Tapuyans_.]

The _Tapuyans_ acknowledge two Deities, the one good and the other bad;
to the good they shew no Reverence, because, say they, he is bountiful
of himself, and doth them no hurt; whereas on the contrary they
zealously call upon their Devil-Deity, because they think he destroys
all those who worship him not.

[Sidenote: Their foretelling of things to come.]

They never Travel nor go to War before they have consulted with their
angry God, and that not without great Ceremonies; whereupon they ascribe
to themselves the knowledge of future things; and indeed they often
foretel future things which are beyond humane apprehension; as a
testimony whereof that may serve which _Sapo Amama_, a _Friezland_
Gentleman, found by experience: for he keeping Guard before _Conjahu_
with a Troop of Horse against the _Portuguese_, had several _Tapuyans_
in his Service, who foretold, That the following day the Lieutenant
_Amama_ and a Trooper should be kill’d by a Shot from a great Gun;
which, though slighted, was confirm’d by the exact fulfilling of the
Prediction. The like Passages hapned daily, and amongst many
_Arcisseusky_ relates one very remarkable Accident, _viz._ He remov’d a
considerable number of Men of the Garrison _Rio Grande_, to surprize the
_Spanish_ Fort _Barra-Canium_, and nothing could more promote the Design
than secrecy; but fifty _Tapuyans_ having joyn’d with the _Hollanders_,
_Arcisseusky_ fear’d they might discover his Plot, wherefore he charg’d
them that they should not stir a foot from his Company, which they
accordingly promis’d, and having march’d three days through By-ways,
they daily perform’d their Devotion in open view, and _Arcisseusky_
desir’d that they would call him when their Devil appear’d, which they
granted, on promise that he should not do him any hurt: On the third day
the Army being sufficiently refresh’d, he being call’d, found the
_Tapuyans_ sitting in a Semi-Circle, with their Feet spread asunder;
opposite to them sat their Priest on the Ground, whom they ask’d
concerning all manner of Affairs, and he question’d them again, on which
they gave their several Answers, but could not be understood for want of
Interpreters, for those whom the _Hollanders_ us’d spake only two
Languages, one of which is us’d commonly by the _Brasilians_ along the
Sea-Coast, and the other by the _Portuguese_, in which they Interpreted
to the _Hollanders_ as much as possibly they could understand of what
the _Tapuyans_ said, whose Language differs very much from the vulgar
_Brasile_ Tongue, because they live up in the Inland, and are divided
into divers Tribes, so that the Interpreters could not understand the
_Tapuyans_, but judg’d their meaning more by nodding of the Head, and
the like signs: after the Assembly had done speaking, the Priest rose up
and went out of their sights into the Wood, where with a loud voice he
call’d three times upon the Devil; but he not answering, the Priest
return’d to his Company, who began their Questions and Answers afresh,
which could not be understood by the Interpreters; and soon after the
Priest (seeming to be commanded by the rest) went again to the Wood, but
calling still in vain, return’d; then going a third time, and calling as
before, was by a small, but shrill Voice, answer’d from the middle of
the Wood, from which the _Tapuyans_ concluded that their Business would
come to perfection, and that the Devil would soon appear to them: The
Priest hereupon going backwards and forwards three times one after
another to his Company, they began to talk as before; at last going into
the Wood again, they all spoke louder, and with more vehemency than
before, whilest the fore-mention’d shrill Voice approached nearer and
nearer, and at last the supposed _Dæmon_ came forth with the Priest, who
commanded him to sit opposite to the Congregation, which had a great
deal of Discourse, and sometimes the Priest speaking was answer’d by the
Devil in his shrill Voice; but some of the People calling aloud, catch’d
up their Arms, and threatned to beat the Devil, as they often us’d to do
upon the like occasions. At the departure of the _Dæmon_, the Multitude
conducted by the Priest into the Wood, cry’d out in so terrible a
manner, that they affrighted the _Hollanders_, who judg’d it rather to
be Lyons and Tygers that roar’d than Men. During these Transactions, a
_German_ Soldier in the Rere quitted his Arms and fled, but being miss’d
was pursu’d, found in a Hedge, and laid Hold on as a Person suspected to
carry Advice to the _Spaniards_, and being brought before _Arcisseusky_
and Examined, gave such ridiculous Answers as increas’d the suspicion,
insomuch that he was led to a Tree to be tortur’d; where as he stood
ty’d he solemnly declar’d, That the reason of his running away, was
because he had not Pray’d in ten years, so that he was exceedingly
afraid, lest when he saw the Devil amongst the _Tapuyans_, he would have
known him, and carry’d him away to the Place prepar’d for all such
Wretches.

[Sidenote: The Imposture.]

The Learned _Gerard Vossius_ made a particular Enquiry after this Story,
whether the Spirit’s appearance were a Reality, or an Imposture; and the
truth is it was no better than a subtile Cheat, and so it was
apprehended by _Arcisseusky_, who not long after, on a convenient time,
ask’d the _Tapuyans_ why they feign’d him to be a Devil that was a Man,
whom he had often seen before? which they denying, affirm’d that it was
a real Devil; but _Arcisseusky_ knew their pretended Friend, who spake
so shrill by reason of a Grass-blade which he held in his Mouth.
However, though the main of the Fable was acted by Man, yet the Devil
without doubt play’d his part with them, as appear’d by those
Predictions, which no Man could possibly know, _viz._ That the
_Portuguese_ Fort should with the loss but of three Men fall into the
_Hollanders_ hands; for so accordingly it hapned. But because the Devil
cannot foresee all things, therefore they often erre; for they said that
the _Hollanders_ should cross the Moat on Boards nail’d together in
stead of a Bridge, and that the Enemy should not perceive it; and indeed
_Arcisseusky_ had resolv’d so to do, but was discover’d by the
_Portuguese_, who defended themselves with great Guns, which so
affrighted the _Tapuyans_, not us’d to such a noise, that they ran away
and never return’d, so that by Morning the Fort was conquer’d, and all
things quieted.

[Sidenote: A pleasant Story between _Arcisseusky_ and a _Tapuyan_
           Priest.]

After this _Arcisseusky_ burnt several _Portuguese_ Ships in the River
_Monguoape_, and kept one, carrying ten Demi-Culverins, laden with Sugar
and _Spanish_ Wine; which to carry to a safe Harbor a short Way, he
requir’d the _Tapuyans_ assistance; but they refus’d to enter,
pretending the Ship would perish by some or other unfortunate Accident,
which accordingly hapned as they had said; for the Ship was split
against a Rock in the Mouth of a narrow Haven, insomuch that nothing of
it was sav’d; all which the _Tapuyans_ knew beforehand by the Devil’s
information, for they never go upon any Business of consequence before
they have consulted with him, and done him worship. Yet, it seems, they
cannot secure this Devil of theirs from the Stripes of a Mortal, as
appears by this pleasant Story: A _Tapuyan_ Priest was promis’d a Shirt
from _Arcisseusky_, upon condition the Devil should pull the same out of
his Hand and carry it up in the Air: The _Tapuyan_ liking the Proposal,
promis’d immediately to call the Devil; but when _Arcisseusky_ desir’d
leave to Drub him with a Stick which he had in his Hand, he could by no
means perswade the Priest to call for his _Dæmon_; at which every one
began to laugh: and to carry on the Mirth farther, _Arcisseusky_ Joking
with the Priest, said, _I will shew you that I am a greater Artist than
you, for to Morrow I will bring it about by my Art, that great Horns
shall grow on your Head, so big, that you shall not be able to pass
these Doors_; which so affrighted the _Tapuyans_, that all of them fled,
onely the Priest return’d the next day with an Interpreter to
_Arcisseusky_, desiring him that he would use him mercifully, and not
cause any Horns to grow on his Head.

At the time when _Jacob Rabbi_ convers’d amongst the _Tapuyans_, they
were Govern’d by _Janduy_, a Man of above a hundred years old, whose
chief Seat was on each side of the River _Otschunogh_, and round about
the Lake _Igtug_, in which none durst Swim, because of the many biting
Fishes in the same.

The King _Pritigaba_ having entred into a strict League with _Janduy_,
Warr’d continually against the Kings _Arygpoygh_, _Wanasewasug_,
_Tshering_, and _Dremenige_; and had not the _Portuguese_ taken the four
last into their Service to aid them against the _Hollanders_, they could
never have held out long against the Forces sent by _Janduy_, who
destroy’d Man, Beast, and Houses, sparing nothing they met with; for
they murther and destroy all things where e’re they come.

[Sidenote: _Brasile_ by whom possess’d at present.]

The several Nations that now possess _Brasile_, besides its native
Inhabitants, are _Portuguese_, _English_, _Hollanders_, _Germans_, and
_French_, which the _Brasilians_ by a general Name call _Ajuru-juba_;
otherwise they call all Strangers _Caraiba_ or _Pero_. But from the
commixing of several Nations proceeds a fifth sort, for one that is born
of _European_ Parents in _Brasile_ is call’d _Mozombo_; of an _European_
Father and _Brasilian_ Mother, _Mameluc_; of an _European_ Father and a
_Moor_, _Mulatto_; of a _Brasilian_ and _Moor_, _Curiboca_, or
_Cabocles_; of two _Negro_’s, _Criolo_. But above all others the
_Portuguese_ are the strongest along the Sea-Coast, who when first they
began to settle on _Brasile_, found great resistance; and had not the
Natives been at Wars amongst themselves, they could never have got so
much footing, but now they are sufficiently Masters; for they have
either slain all the old Inhabitants, or driven them up into the Inland:
However, the _Brasilians_ are so valiant, that they will Encounter a
great Army, being brought up in the Wars from their Cradle. When they
Engage one with another they shoot their Arrows exceeding thick,
Hooting, Hollowing, and Leaping from one side to the other to shun the
Arrows with a wonderful dexterity: The Conquerors spare none, but kill
all, and Feast on the slain Bodies; but some they hale away Prisoners
with a Rope about their Necks, to each of whom they allot a young Maid,
who cherishes and fattens them up for five Moneths, at the end of which
they make a great Feast, and drink to a pitch beyond Sense or Reason,
having first fill’d their Bellies with the Flesh of the slain Prisoners
roasted. If the Woman be got with Child by the Slain, they imagine that
they can take no greater revenge of their Enemy, than to devour the
Child as soon as it comes into the World; but it often happens, that the
Woman really loving her Husband the Prisoner, runs away with him, and so
bereaves her Friends of a Banquet.

                              St. Vincent.

[Sidenote: Places of note in the _Præfecture_ of _St. Vincent_.]

The continual Wars which the _Portuguese_ have maintain’d against the
_Brasilians_, have hindred them from Setling any where but along the
Sea-side, where their Residences are divided into thirteen _Præfectures_
or Lordships, by them call’d _Capitanias_; the Southermost whereof being
1. _St. Vincent_, hath a City of the same Denomination, which lies near
a River that coming out of the Ocean runs round in the Countrey, and so
returns into the Sea.

2. _Sanctos los Leyes_, which reckons four hundred Houses and three
Sugar-Mills. Here great Ships take in their Lading in the middle of the
City.

3. _Hitauhacin_, the most Southern, is inhabited by the _Portuguese_.
Twelve Leagues from thence up into the Countrey the _Jesuits_ have built
the Village _St. Paulo_, near the Gold-Mines that lie in the Mountains,
extending from East to West thirty Leagues. This Village, long since
containing eighty Houses, is inhabited by _Brasilians_ and a mix’d
People; the Way thither is troublesom, over rough Mountains, and Ways
overgrown with Brambles.

On the Island _Britioga_, at a sandy Inlet which makes a good Harbor,
lies a Fort for defence of the Haven _St. Vincent_: and since the
_English_, _Anno 1582._ sunk a Ship there, a second Fort hath been built
to prevent the coming in up the River; yet notwithstanding Captain
_Thomas Candish_ ran by both the Forts, and burnt _St. Vincent_, but
spar’d _Sanctos_.

Before the River which washes _St. Vincent_, appears the Island
_Sebastian_, pretty large, wooddy, and well stor’d with Venison; It hath
wholsom Water, good Herbage, and a secure Road for Ships against all
Winds.

Farther into the Sea appears the high and rocky Isles _Alcatraces_, as
also _Victorio des Busires_, _Porto des Castellanos_, _Monte de Frigo_,
_Muella_, and _Queimadas_.

[Sidenote: The Nature of the _Tupinikinsi_, Natives of _St. Vincent_.]

The Natives of _St. Vincent_, which are in League with the _Portuguese_,
are call’d _Tupinikinsi_, inhabiting the Mountains which extend above
twenty eight Leagues up into the Countrey: They maintain continual Wars
against the _Carioes_, a civiliz’d People, and white of Complexion, as
also against the _Cupin Imbas_ on the North, and a nameless People
bordering on _Peru_. Moreover, the _Miramumins_, a very wild People,
range all the Countrey over, but are much lessen’d since the
_Portugueses_ Arrival.


                               SECT. III.
                            Rio de Janeiro.

[Sidenote: First Discovery and Possession of _Rio de Janeiro_.]

The second Lordship _Rio de Janeiro_, formerly by the _French_ call’d
_Ganabara_, was discover’d _Anno 1515._ by _Juan Dias de Solis_; but the
_French_ first Setled themselves here forty years after _Dias de Solis_:
for setting Sail from _Havre de Grace_ with three well Mann’d Ships,
Commanded by _Nicholas Durandus Villegagnon_, they arriv’d at _Rio
Janeiro_ in _November_, and at the Entrance into the River, which is
about half a League broad, built a woodden Fort of a hundred Foot long,
and sixty broad, and giving it the Name of the _French_ Admiral
_Coligni_, put several Guns into the same to secure the Entrance,
inclos’d on each side by two steep Mountains. In the River, which is
very broad, lie several wooddy Isles, on one of which, near the Fort
_Coligni_, _Villegagnon_ Setling himself, suffer’d great Inconveniences
for want of Water, because he durst not Land on the Main, for fear of
being surpris’d by the Natives. Here he stay’d a year and a half in a
deplorable Condition, when _Philip Corguileray_ and _Du Pont_ set Sail
with three Ships from the Haven _Honfleurs_; but they also, though they
had many Men, yet were ill stor’d with Provisions, insomuch that Hunger
increas’d amongst them daily: wherefore _Villegagnon_ return’d home
without any farther Exploits.

[Sidenote: _Jean Leri_ his Description thereof.]

_Jean Leri_, who went with _Corguileray_, describes _Rio Janeiro_ after
this manner:

“The River (saith he) lies twenty three Degrees Southward of the
_Equinoctial Line_; the Inlet of the Sea, twenty four thousand Paces
broad, and in some places broader, is hemm’d in by hills; the Mouth of
the Inlet is somewhat dangerous, by reason of three rocky Isles; beyond
the large Bay is a narrow Channel, on the left-hand whereof there rises
a high Mountain, which the _French_ call’d _Le Pot de Beure_, because it
resembles a Butter-pot. Somewhat farther lies the Rock _Ratier_, where
_Villegagnon_ thought to build a Fort, but the Water in stormy Weather
washing over the Rock, he was forc’d to give over his Design. Half a
League farther is an Island a thousand Paces in length, and a hundred
and fifty in breadth, surrounded with Rocks, on which the _French_
resided: at each end of the Isle rises a Hill, and from the middle a
Rock sixty Foot high; on the Hill _Villegagnon_ pitcht his Tent till he
had built him a handsom House on a Rock; the other Houses were built in
the Valley. Three Leagues and a half farther lies a fruitful Isle nine
Miles in circumference, inhabited by a salvage People call’d
_Touoebinambauti_: there are several other Isles, on which breed good
Oysters with little Pearls, which stick so fast to great Stones, that
they can scarce be pluckt off. The River _Janeiro_ abounds with Fish.”

[Sidenote: Towns and Places of chief note.]

The _French_ once possess’d this Island, but were dispossess’d by
_Emanuel de Sa_, Governor of _Brasile_, for the _Portuguese_.

The City _Sebastian_, which contains three hundred Houses, is built on
the Southern Point of _Janeiro_; opposite to which, on the Northern
Point, lies the Fort; a large Church, the _Jesuits_ Cloyster, and two
Sugar-Mills, give no small lustre to the City, where the chief Trade
consists in _Brasile_ Wood and Cotton. The _French_ Storm’d this Town
_Anno 1581._ but march’d off without any success. _Dirk Ruiters_, an
Eye-witness, gives us this Description of _Sebastian_:

“The Town (says he) lies two Leagues up the River _Janeiro_, in a Bay,
about which it is built like a Semi-Circle in a sandy Soil along the
Water, and is about a Mile long; at each end rise steep Mountains,
besides which it hath neither Walls nor Gates; but its strength consists
of four Forts, the chiefest whereof stands towards the East on a Rock in
the Mouth of the River; the second towards the West, an Isle which on
the South-East rises with a Mountain resembling a Sugar-Loaf: the third
crowns a Rock South-East from the Town; and the fourth, in the
North-West, a high Mountain. The Natives, call’d _Tououpinambauti_, are
very serviceable to the _Portuguese_.”

Besides the fore-mention’d Towns _Coligni_ and _St. Sebastian_, some
make mention of another in this _Præfecture_, call’d _Angra de los
Reyes_, twelve Leagues distant from _St. Sebastian_ Westward.

The Burroughs of the Natives are populous, but neither strong by Nature,
nor fortifi’d, and so not by any one thought worthy the naming.


                               SECT. IV.
                           De Spirito Sancto.

[Sidenote: Description of the Lordship _De Spirito Sancto_.]

[Sidenote: Several strange sorts of Fish.]

Next to _Rio Janeiro_ lies the Lordship or County _De Spirito Sancto_,
exceeding fruitful, having divers Woods abounding with Venison. The
Rivers _Parayva_, _Manangea_, _Itapemeri_, _Iritibi_, and _Guarapari_,
are stor’d with all sorts of Fish, and amongst others the Fish
_Piratiapua_, which in the Winter Moneths lives in the Rivers, and
against the Summer returns to the Rocks wash’d by the Ocean. This Fish
hath a wide Mouth full of Teeth, a reddish Tongue, little Fins, except
those on their Backs, divers colour’d Scales, yet most of a dark Red,
and generally weighs fifty Pound.

Here is also the Fish _Paru_, full of yellow Scales like Half-Moons over
a black Skin; it hath long Fins near the Tail, and a little Head.

No less remarkable is the _Guebucu_, which hath a long Body, a sharp
bonie Snout, the upper Jaw reaching over the other, no Teeth, a Tail
divided in the middle, sharp Fins on the Back, and a Skin full of
Silver-colour’d Prickles. This Monster not onely devours great Fishes,
but also Men; when it is hungry it often runs its Snout through the side
of a Ship.

But there is no Fish more deform’d than the _Abacatuaja_, which being
oval and flat, hath two long Fins underneath, and one on the top, a
divided Tail, green Fins, a smooth Skin, and fiery Eyes; as soon as it
is taken it cries like a Hog.

[Sidenote: The Serpent _Boiguacu_.]

In this County stands a Town of the same Denomination, which contains
two hundred Houses, a Sugar-Mill, and a Cloyster of _Jesuits_, and
drives a great Trade in Cotton and _Brasile_ Wood. Before the City lies
an Inlet full of Isles, the Mouth of which is guarded by a Castle. The
Natives, call’d _Maigaias_, are in League with the _Portuguese_, but the
_Tapuyans_ and _Apiapetangas_ do them all the mischief they can
possibly; so that the _Portuguese_ travel in great danger of their
lives, when any Business calls them, through the Countrey of these
salvage People. But besides these People, the Way is pester’d with
strange wild Beasts, especially on the Mountain _Mestre Alvaro_, which
is seen at a great distance off at Sea; on which, amongst other
Creatures, breeds the terrible Serpent _Boiguacu_, whose length is
generally twenty four Foot; it is of an Ash colour, with great and small
black Spots, with a little white Speck in the middle; when hungry, it
leaps out of the Hedges, or from the tops of Trees, raises it self
upright on its Tail, and winding about either Man, Beast, or whate’re it
be, squeezes it to death, or puts its Tail, which ends in a sharp Point
or Sting, in at the Fundament in such a manner, that it kills the
Creature on which it seizeth in a moment, and then swallows it up. This
Serpent hath strong Ribs inwardly, and more than seventy bonie Joynts;
wherefore it turns it self with great ease; the Joynt-bones near the
Head are the biggest, and grow smaller and smaller towards the Tail: It
also feeds on Pismires.

[Sidenote: The Bird _Jabicu-guacu_.]

This County also breeds the Bird _Jabicu-guacu_, which exceeds the Crane
in bigness, and hath a long thick Bill, but no Tongue; on his Head
appears a white grisly Crest or Mitre; the Wings and Tail are short, and
the Feathers most of them white, except the Pinions, which shine like
Rubies; their Flesh is of a good rellish, but somewhat dry.

Near the River which washes the City _Spirito Sancto_, the _Paraibes_
dwell in Huts, not unlike Ovens.


                                SECT. V.
                             Porto Seguro.

[Sidenote: Description of _Porto Seguro_.]

Next to the fore-mention’d County borders _Porto Seguro_, discover’d by
_Pedro Alvares Capralis_, who gave this Countrey the Name of _Terra de
Santa Cruiz_, but afterwards chang’d it to _Porto Seguro_, because he
found a secure Harbor there. The Town, built on the top of a white Rock,
gives its Denomination to the whole Countrey, and harbor’d long since
two hundred and twenty Families, and hath five Sugar-Mills. The Land on
the North side of the Rock rises high, but Southwardly a smooth Coast
runs along the Ocean, from which two Leagues off at Sea lie several
Cliffs, against which the Waves break with a great force.

The Towns _Santa Cruiz_ and _Amaro_ are left desolate, because the
_Portuguese_ were continually Invaded by the salvage _Aymures_, whom
they were not able by any means to repress.

Southward from _Porto Seguro_ appear the Shoals _Abrolhos_, twenty six
Leagues from the Coast; they are of one breadth, but one is longer than
the other.

[Illustration]

[Sidenote: Remakable Wreck of the Ship _Batavia_.]

[Sidenote: _Corneliszoon_: his villainous Attempt.]

On this Coast the Ship _Batavia_ was cast away _Anno 1629._ which
Accident is the more remakable for the Murders committed by the Factor,
_Hieronymus Corneliszoon_, who with some Confederates resolv’d to run
away with the Ship, and to Sail to some _Spanish_ Haven, or _Dunkirk_,
and so to pillage the _Netherland_ Vessels; but their Design was
frustrated by the Ships running against the _Abrolhos_: _Francis
Pelsaert_, chief Commander, first caus’d the Sick, with the Women and
Children, to be put on an Island, or else on two Rocks about three
Leagues distant from the place where the Ship lay, in which remain’d
seventy Men, whom _Pelsaert_ in vain endeavor’d to carry away; for the
Sea was so rough that a Boat was not able to abide in the same, and also
the Storm beginning to increase, beat the Ship more and more against the
Sands, and the Seamen venturing towards the Isle on pieces of Timber,
were some drown’d, others by the Waves, were driven ashore, amongst whom
was _Hieronymus Corneliszoon_, who preserv’d his Life twenty four hours
on the Boltsprit after the Ship was stav’d; but not terrifi’d with such
an Accident, he continu’d in his fore-mention’d Resolution. On one of
the Cliffs were forty Persons with eighty Cans of Water, but on the
Island a hundred and eighty with much less; upon which _Pelsaert_, who
when the Storm ceas’d, thought to save somewhat more out of his Wrack,
was necessitated to seek for fresh Water on one of the said Cliffs, but
not finding enough, trimm’d up his Boat and set Sail homeward, from
thence to fetch a new supply of People: During which time
_Cornelisszoon_ perform’d his Vilany; for he chose _David_ of _Zeevang_,
_Gysbrecht Welderen_, _Coenraed Huissen_, _Cornelis Pieterszoon_,
_Rutger Frederickszoon_, and _Hans Heilwerk_, for his Assistants,
besides several others, and destroy’d all the People on the Island,
except five, who escap’d on pieces of Timber to the Rock where _Weyber
Hays_ resided with forty Men, who being inform’d what the aforesaid
Villains had done, prepar’d for resistance with sharp-pointed Sticks,
those People on the second Rock being also slain by _Zeevang_, who
spared onely some Women and seven Boys; after which _Hieronymus
Corneliszoon_ took _Lucretia Jans_ for his Wife; in like manner
_Huissen_ took _Judith Sebastiaens_; the remaining Women serv’d the rest
for Concubines. Not long after twenty of them going in Sloops, fell upon
_Weiber Hays_, who valiantly resisted them: but because _Hays_’s Life
was of great consequence, by reason he might give notice of their
Actions to the Ship which was expected from _Holland_, and which they
design’d to run away with, therefore they renew’d their Assault with
fifteen Men more, and were again beat off; wherefore they resolv’d to
make a Peace, which _Hieronymus Corneliszoon_ promis’d to ratifie the
next day; nevertheless this Peace was but feigned, for under pretence
thereof they deliver’d Letters to several _French_ Soldiers that were
under _Hays_’s Command, promising each six thousand _Guilders_ if they
would joyn with them; but they shew’d the Letters to _Hays_, who keeping
it secret, that he might draw on _Hieronymus Corneliszoon_, not
mistrusting the Discovery, to come thither at the appointed time, took
him Prisoner, and caus’d _Zeevang_, _Huissen_, _Welderen_, and _Cornelis
Pieterszoon_ to be put to death; but _Wouter Loos_ making his escape,
was chosen chief of the Rebels, who ventur’d a fourth Assault, but
returning without any effect left off making any farther Attempt. Mean
while _Pelsaert_ arriving with the _Sardam_ Frigat from _Holland_, sent
a Boat ashore, which by a little Skiff dispatcht by _Hays_, was inform’d
of all the Passages; whereupon the Boat returning, _Pelsaert_ as he was
putting himself into a posture of Defence, espy’d a Sloop coming about
the Southern Point of the Island, in which were eleven of the Rebels
clad in Scarlet with Silver Lace, which making directly towards the
Ship, as soon as they came up, were commanded to throw away their Arms
over-board; which having done, and coming aboard the Frigat, they were
all put in Irons, as also their remaining Party, and condemn’d to die.

Opposite to the _Abrolhos_ on the Main Coast, a plain Countrey extends
it self thirty Leagues in length, inhabited by the _Ouetacates_, a cruel
People, who continually either destroy one another, or else make sad
slaughters amongst their Neighbors.

The County _Porto Seguro_ belongs to the _Spanish_ Duke of _Avero_, but
is very much decay’d.

[Sidenote: The Beast _Capybara_.]

The Rivers _Moucuripe_, _Caruvelas_, and _Lucuru_, breed abundance of
Water-Hogs call’d _Capybara_, which have short Feet, Bristles and Ears,
a thick Body and Head, with a bearded Snout, besides two Tusks, and
twenty four lesser Teeth in each Jaw, but no Tail; they feed on Grass
and Bushes in whole Herds on the Shore, and make a terrible noise; and
though they cannot run fast, yet they dive and swim extraordinary quick.

[Sidenote: The _Tapiirete_.]

The _Tapiirete_ also resembles a Hog, especially in its Head and Feet,
but is as big as a Heifer of six Moneths old, hath a Snout hanging over
its under Lip, a Mouth full of Teeth, and on its Skin short and dark
colour’d Hair. This Beast is very libidinous, and in the Nights spoils
the Fruit-Trees, especially the Sugar-Canes, but in the Day-time it
sleeps in Thickets. The Flesh of a young _Tapiirete_ tastes like Beef.

Lastly, the Inhabitants of _Porto Seguro_ are plentifully supply’d with
Rabbets, and the more, because there being divers sorts of them, (some
say five) they are taken in great abundance, either in Traps, Snairs, or
Gins, or by discovering their Holes; for the Hunters stopping the
entrance of them, dig a Hole directly over the place where the Coneys
lodge, and so kill them with long Pike-staves in the Ground.

[Sidenote: Five sorts of Rabbets in _Brasile_.]

Of these five sorts of Rabbets in _Brasile_, the chiefest, call’d
_Paca_, hath a thick Head, little Ears, their fore-Feet bigger than
their hind-Feet, short, hard, and brown Hair, speckled grey on the
Sides, but no Tail: The Flesh of this sort of Rabbets is very delicate.

The second sort is the _Tupesi_, which being like a Hare amongst us, may
as well be accounted of that kind.

The _Aguti_ resembles our Rabbets, onely it hath harsh brown Hair, round
Ears, bald Feet, gruntles like a Hog, hath two Toes more on their
hind-Legs than on the foremost.

The _Cavia Cobaya_, though less than the _European_ Rabbets, excell them
in soft and divers-colour’d Hair, distinguish’d by white, red, and black
Spots; their Head and Teeth resemble those of a Rat, but it hath no
Tail: No Rabbets can be made tamer than these, and if carry’d to any
remote Countrey, breed as well there as in _Brasile_.

The last of all is the _Aparea_, which differs little in running from a
Hare, as also in respect of the Head and Beard, harbors more in rent
Cliffs than in sandy Ground.

[Sidenote: The Tree _Tucum_.]

The Soil of _Porto Seguro_ bears two sorts of Palm-Trees, _viz._ the
_Tucum_ and _Airi_; the _Tucum_ hath small Boughs full of prickly
Leaves, and a fruit not unlike the Damask Prune, hanging in Clusters of
three or four hundred together; and being excellent Food to fatten Hogs
and Apes; also when press’d yielding a clear Oyl, which is highly
esteem’d: the Fruit when ripe grows black without, and within hath a
white Kernel: of the Leaves the _Brasilians_ spin fine and strong Thred.

[Illustration]

The _Airi_ grows much higher than the _Tucum_, and hath also longer
Leaves, a Body full of sharp Thorns, and a round Fruit full of white and
oylie Pulp, but not eatable; the Wood hard, heavy and black, sinks in
the Water, and the _Brasilians_ make their Clubs of the same.

[Sidenote: The Bird _Cocoi_.]

Along the Rivers flie the Birds _Cocoi_, resembling Herons, though in
beauty they far exceed them; they have but little Flesh, long sharp
Bills, of a yellowish green colour, and curious Crests of Feathers on
their Heads, which fall back over their Necks; their Flesh when young is
delicate.

                              Los Isleos.

[Sidenote: Situation and Description of _Los Isleos_.]

Next _Porto Seguro_ borders the Countrey _Los Isleos_, so call’d from
its chief Town, which consists of a hundred and fifty Houses, (or
perhaps by this time many more) eight Sugar-Mills, a Cloyster for the
_Jesuits_, and a Church. The Inhabitants live by Tillage, and
Transporting of Provisions in little Barks to _Pernambuco_.

Seven Leagues farther in the Countrey, beyond the Town of _Isleos_, lies
a nameless Lake three Leagues long, as many broad, and above ten Fathom
deep, and full of the Fish _Manati_, which are very large and well
tasted, besides abundance of Crocodiles; and in windy Weather the Water
is as rough as if it were in the Ocean. Out of this Lake flows a River
by a Passage so narrow, that a Boat can scarce pass through the same.

Round about this River live the _Guaymures_, the most salvage People of
all _America_; they are of a Gigantick size, have white Skins, carry
exceeding great Bowes and Arrows, live without Houses like Beasts,
devour Mans-flesh like Tygers, never Fight in Companies or Armies, but
watch to surprize a single Man or Beast; they also eat their own
Children, and possess’d formerly all the Land from the River _St.
Francisco_ to the Promontory _Frio_; but beaten from thence by the
_Tupinambas_ and _Tupinachias_, they went to the County _Los Isleos_,
which they Invaded in such a manner, that the _Portuguese_ were not
onely forc’d to leave several Sugar-Mills, but also the whole Countrey.


                               SECT. VII.
                      Bahia de Todos los Sanctos.

[Sidenote: Situation and Description of _Todos los Sanctos_.]

Next to _Isleos_ borders _Bahia de Todos los Sanctos_, belonging to the
_Portuguese_. The Inlet which borrows its Denomination from all the
Saints, gives Name to this eminent County. The Bay great and wide, and
in the middle from twelve to eighteen Fathom deep, lies in thirteen
Degrees Southward of the _Equinoctial Line_. The Coast rises white along
the Sea side. The Current according to the course of the Sun runs six
Moneths towards the South, and as many towards the North. The opening of
the Inlet is on the South, but it flows up Northerly, and contains two
Leagues and a half in breadth; several fresh Rivers discharge their
Waters into the same: The utmost and biggest Island _Taperica_ breaks
off the Waves which come rowling in from the Ocean. Those that Sail into
the same must have the Island on their left Hand, and the Main Coast on
their right, which is known by a Promontory, on which the Fort
_Antonio_, and the old City _Villa Veja_ are built, near a little Bay
with a Foreland on the North, from which the Main Coast circling like a
Half-Moon ends near the Point _Tapagipe_, which juts out from _Bahia
Todos los Sanctos_. The Castle _Tapesiepe_ stands on the utmost Point,
where the Countrey winding towards the East makes the Inlet larger, from
whence a narrow Channel runs up into the Countrey, and there makes a
Lake which extends North and South: from the Mouth of the Lake the Coast
reaches Northward to the River _Pitanga_, which comes gliding out of the
East, and in its Passage receives several Streams, on whose Banks stand
divers Sugar-Mills. From _Pitanga_ the Coast extends a League Northward,
then Westerly with a crooked Elbow, in whose circumference lie two
nameless Isles close under the Shore; this Elbow ends in a blunt Point,
about half a League from which lies the Island _Mare_, a League long, in
the Mouth of the River _Pitanga_. To the Northward from hence a River
disembogues in the said Inlet. More Southerly appears _Monks-Isle_, from
whence the Coast extends it self Northerly, where several Islands appear
at an exact distance from the Coast; the first beyond the fore-mention’d
blunt Point, is _Birapebiara_; the next, which lies closer to the Shore,
_Porto Madero_; next comes in view a long Island in the Mouth of a
River, from whence the Countrey extends Westward, and fronts the Island
_De Fuentes_, as doth also the River _Tambaria_, which comes out of the
North, but empties it self with a crooked Arm near the rest; from hence
the Coast with two little Bays runs North-West to the Stream _Geresipe_,
in whose Mouth, which is pretty large, appear three Isles on a row, the
utmost whereof is call’d _Caraibe_, the middlemost _Pycca_, the
innermost hath no Name, but divides the River into two Channels; from
hence the Coast bends with several Inlets, into which fall divers
Rivulets towards the South, from the River _Cachoera_, full of little
Isles, opposite to which stand several Sugar-Mills. Against _Cachoera_
appears the Island _Meve_, and more Southerly _Taperica_, between the
sharp Point _Tapagipe_ and the Castle _Antonio_. Near the fore-mention’d
the City _St. Salvador_ was built by _Thomas de Sosa_, who weighing
Anchor from _Lisbon_, _Anno 1549._ Landed safely near _Villa Veja_, and
about half a League from thence pitch’d upon a Hill, and took order
forthwith for the erecting of his new City there, giving to each of his
Followers a place to build on: the _Jesuits_ chose the large Plain where
at present stands the Church Consecrated to the Virgin _Mary_; the Names
of the said _Jesuits_ were _Juan Azpilcueta_, _Antonio Pireo_, _Leonardo
Nonnio_, _Didaco Jacobeo_, _Vincentio Roderigo_, and _Emanuel Nobrega_;
whilest the common People set themselves to the building of
Dwelling-houses: But when _John_ the Third, King of _Portugal_, sent a
Priest thither to Teach in the new Church of _Maria_, the fore-mention’d
_Jesuits_ remov’d from thence to a high Hill, which they call’d _The
Mountain Calvarien_, whither divers _Brasilians_ came flocking, and
pitch’d their Tents about the Cloyster, admiring their strange
Neighbors.

[Illustration: SINUS OMNIUM SANCTORU]

When _Sosa_ Landed on the fore-mention’d Shore, the _Portuguese_ had but
little footing on _America_; for their Plantations at _Isleos_, _St.
Vincent_, _Pernambuco_, _Villa Veja_, _Itamaraca_, and _Porto Seguro_,
discover’d by _Pedro Alvares Capralis_, _Anno 1500._ were run all to
ruine.

Beside the City _St. Salvador_ and the decay’d Town _Villa Veja_, the
City _Paripe_ lies three Leagues farther into the Countrey, consisting
of three thousand Families, and eighteen Sugar-Mills: The Countrey about
the same produces plenty of Cotton.

The Island _Taperica_, which is pretty large, hath a fertile Soil for
the production of Tobacco, and Grass to fatten Cattel: The Inhabitants
boyl much Train-Oyl of the Whales, which come ashore there in
considerable numbers.

Twelve Leagues Southward from _St. Salvador_ appears the Village
_Cacocheira_, formerly belonging to a rich _Portuguese_, who took great
pains in reforming the salvage People _Guaymures_ to a civil Life; but
seeing he profited but little, he caus’d great Companies of them to be
remov’d to _Taperica_, that they might do less mischief, where the
unusual and unwholsom Air kill’d them all in a short time.

The Lordship _Bahia_ hath abundance of Sugar-Mills, which are either
turn’d by the Water, or drawn by Oxen.

[Illustration]

[Sidenote: The manner of Planting Sugar-Canes.]

[Sidenote: The Worm _Guirapeacopa_.]

[Sidenote: The manner of making Sugar in the Sugar-Mills.]

The Sugar-Canes, by the _Brasilians_ call’d _Viba_ or _Tacomaree_, grow
better in a clayie and fat Soil, over which the Rivers flowing leave
their Mud, than on High-lands, Hills, or Mountains; they are Planted
after this manner: They first plough their Fields, weed them, and make
Holes at an exact distance one from the other, into which they plant
their Canes in such a manner, that the tops touch one another. The Holes
before mention’d require more Earth to fill them in Summer than in
Winter, that the violent Heat of the Sun may not dry up the Root, and
that the Rain may the freelier come at them to moisten them, for the
more moisture they have, the better they grow; they attain to their full
ripeness in ten, or at most in twelve Moneths; _February_ and _March_
being the two last Winter Moneths, are accounted the best to Plant in,
because the Earth softned by Rains, suffers the Root to shoot forth the
better. The ripe Canes being cut off, are left in the Field till the
following Year; during which time new Canes growing, are often ground in
the Mill with the old ones; but if they stand two years, then the sweet
Liquor dries up, and the Cane withers. The young Plants carefully
planted in good Ground may last forty, nay fifty years; but in a barren
Soil they set new every five years. Sometimes in great Droughts and
extraordinary hot Seasons, the Canes are scorcht to nothing, which being
burnt in the Winter, the Ashes serve to Dung the Ground; and so in like
manner when the Water, overflowing the Fields, drowns the young Plants.
In moist Grounds the black-wing’d Worm, call’d _Guirapeacopa_, (by the
_Portuguese_ nam’d _Pao de Galeuba_) gnaws the Roots in such a manner,
that the Canes die; and sometimes it happens also that the Weeds choak
the young Plants; wherefore the Ground is to be weeded four times a
year, till such time as the Canes are strong enough to bear against the
Weeds: they cut off the ripe Canes at the lowermost Joynt, and, all the
Leaves being first pull’d off, tie them up in Bundles, and bring them to
the Mills, which consist of three great Iron Bars, between which the
Canes are squeez’d. The Water-Mills are turn’d by the force of the
Water, which in great Gutters led from high Mountains falls with
exceeding force into Pools made for that purpose; after which manner,
though they wind the Canes much faster, yet they get not so much Sugar
as when they grind them in the Mills turn’d by Cattel: The places
through which the Juice runs must be cleans’d twice in twenty four
hours; the Canes put in behind between the first Bar, are turn’d into
the second, and thence into the third, which successively squeezes out
all the remaining Juice: The Canes thus press’d, serve for Fewel to
burn; but they constantly keep such a great Fire both Night and Day,
that besides those press’d Canes, they burn forty Fathom of Wood in
twenty four hours, insomuch that whole Woods are consum’d in a short
time: The Liquor, nam’d _Caldo_, runs along woodden Gutters into great
Kettles, in which it is boyl’d, but if it happen to be over-boyl’d they
put Water amongst it, whereby it becomes excellent Food for Horses; then
they put the Liquor into a second Kettle, where it is boyl’d afresh, and
also scumm’d; and for the better cleansing of it, Lime-Juyce and other
things are put amongst it; then they strein it through Clothes, and give
the Dross which remains in the same to the Slaves, which work for half a
year together Night and Day like Horses. The Dross mix’d with Water
makes also good Wine. Out of the great Kettles, by the _Portuguese_
call’d _Caldero de Mellar_, the _Caldo_ runs into the lesser nam’d
_Tachas_, where it is boyl’d a third time, and continually stirr’d till
it comes to be thick like a Syrrup, and at last to the consistence of
Sugar: It may be accounted amongst the Mysteries of Nature, that while
the Sugar boyls in the _Tachas_, which are the little Kettles, they must
drop Oyl amongst the Liquor, which if they should do whilest it is in
the great Kettel, the Liquor would not turn to the consistence of Sugar;
as on the contrary, if they should put their Lye into the little Kettles
as they do into the great, the Liquor would be quite spoil’d. In their
Boyling-houses stand several hundreds of Earthen Pots one by another on
Planks full of Holes; which Pots they cover with moist clay, and after
fourteen days knocking it out of the Pots, they separate the brown Sugar
from the white, both which are laid to dry in the Sun, and put into
Chests.

                              SECT. VIII.
                              Pernambuco.

[Sidenote: Description of _Pernambuco_.]

Northward from _Bahia de Todos los Sanctos_ lies _Pernambuco_, which
extends along the Coast above seventy Leagues, between the River _St.
Francisco_ and the Countrey of _Hamaraca_.

_Pernambuco_, which signifies _Hells-Mouth_, is on the East wash’d by
the Northern Ocean; in which grows a Weed much like an Oaken Leaf, and
so thick, that unless it be cut to make their Way, impedes the Sailing
of Ships.

[Sidenote: Several sorts of Fish.]

The Sea is also very full of Fish, which in calm Weather are visible
sixty Fathom deep, and are taken in greater abundance than they are able
to spend; for they no sooner let down a Bait, cover’d with Feathers and
Tallow, but the Fish immediately swallowing the same, are taken.

Here are in the first place abundance of _Hays_, a Fish so rank and
oylie, that they are not eatable, but their Brains are accounted good
against the Stone.

There are also hereabouts a sort of flying Fish like Herrings, but not
so big; they have Wings like Bats, which carry them above Water whilest
they are wet; they swim in shoals, and are chased by all other Fishes,
which endeavoring to escape by flight out of the Water, they become a
prey to the Sea-pies.

The Sea-Breams are as well tasted as the flying Fish; the Mariners cover
them in Salt, or stuff them within full of Salt and Pepper, and so hang
them to dry in the Sun.

_Pernambuco_ it self lying in five Degrees Southward from the _Equinox_,
produces abundance of _Brasile_ Wood and Sugar-Canes, which last is no
proper _Brasilian_ Plant, for the first Plants thereof were by the
_Portuguese_ first transplanted thither from the _Canary_ Islands.

[Sidenote: First Discovery.]

This Countrey was first discover’d by _Americus Vesputius_, who being
sent thither by _Emanuel_, King of _Portugal_, to discover the Coast
between the Promontory before _Olinda_ and the Island _Itamaraca_, and
finding a split Rock and some _Brasilian_ Huts, Landed, and ask’d the
Denomination of the Coast, which he was inform’d was call’d
_Pernambuco_, which he found full of steep Mountains, inaccessible
Woods, and in some places Plains and pleasant Valleys; but the chiefest
thing he could find to lade his Ship with, was _Brasile_ Wood; but being
inform’d that the Soil would bear Sugar-Canes, he caus’d _Canary_
Sugar-Plants to be Set there.

[Sidenote: Chief Towns and Places of note.]

_Olinda_, formerly the chief City of _Pernambuco_, had (according to
_Lopez_) above three thousand Houses and seventy Sugar-Mills: It is
built on several Hills, which on the North-side are steep and overgrown
with Brambles; betwixt which in many places grow Orange-Trees. _John
Newhof_, who arriv’d at _Olinda_ Anno 1642. found a few _Netherlanders_
and _Spaniards_ there, who dwelt in the ruin’d Houses. The Land-side of
the City is strengthned by Hills overgrown with Brambles and Thorns, and
towards the Sea-side with Earthen Walls, fortifi’d by fourteen Bulwarks
and a Stone Castle, able to withstand a considerable force: The
Out-works towards the South were maintain’d by _Jews_, who from the
fore-mention’d Hills could see not onely a great way into the Ocean, but
also the River _Biberibi_, which hath a Stone Bridge leading to the
City, and Northerly and Westward the Way lies through great Woods and
Forrests. _Olinda_ it self is divided into twenty seven large Streets,
besides lesser Lanes and several Avenues, and five chief Churches,
_viz._ _Misericordia_, _Nostra Sennora del Emparo_, and _Nostra Sennora
de Guadalupe_, _San Salvador_, and _San Pedro_, besides two others of
lesser note. On the highest Hill stands the _Jesuits_ Cloyster, built
square and high, and surrounded with Walls, on which _Sebastian_ King of
_Portugal_, by the perswasion of his Uncle Cardinal _Henry_, spent a
great sum of Money, and endow’d it with annual Revenues, _Anno 1571._
The _Capuchins_ also built a stately Cloyster towards the East. The
_Franciscans_ moreover inhabited a magnificent Building, near which
stood the Governors Palace. The _Carmelites_ had also a stately Edifice,
whose former lustre still appears by the Ruines, where now Cattel graze;
from the Hills about which may be exactly discern’d _Reciffa_, the
Promontory of _St. Augustine_, and the Castle before the Road of
_Reciffa_: Along the Shore stood the _Dominican_ Cloyster, and in the
upper part of the City the Minster, Consecrated to _St. Bento_,
exceeding strong both by Nature and Art; near which stood _Conceptio de
nostra Sennora_. The Fort _Juan de Albuquerque_ stood on the South-side,
from whence a Way leads you along the Shore to _Reciffa_, where hard by
the Potter’s House stood a Beacon. But since _Olinda_ fell into the
hands of the _Netherland East-India_ Company, they built a strong
Fortress on the North near the Sea-side, where formerly a great Trade
was driven with Sugar, insomuch that forty Ships have been fraighted in
a day therewith from _Olinda_, and still as much more remain’d in the
Store-houses. The Sugar cannot be made without the help of _African_
Slaves, and that in great numbers; for _Angola_ alone provided fifteen
thousand four hundred and thirty _Moors_ for the Sugar-Mills about
_Olinda_.

[Sidenote: The Expedition of _Loncque_.]

[Sidenote: _Olinda_ taken by the _Hollanders_.]

[Sidenote: The Fort _St. George_ taken.]

In the Years 1601, 1602, and 1623. there was sent to surprize this City
_Henrick Loncque_, who a little before with _Peter Peterszoon Hein_ took
the _Spanish_ Plate-Fleet, and brought it away from _Matanca_. In the
middle of _June_, Anno 1629. _Loncque_ weighed Anchor from the _Goerean_
Road, and between great _Canary_ and _Teneriff_ he was Engag’d (having
but eight Sail) with forty _Spanish_ Ships, Commanded by _Frederick de
Toledo_, fought his way through the midst of them, and near _St.
Vincent_ (the rest of his Fleet being come up to him, which in all made
up twenty seven) he stay’d for a farther promis’d Supply of Ships to
assist him, and the longer, because the Men rais’d by the _Netherland
West-India_ Company were taken into the _States_ Service, to oppose the
_Spanish_ and Imperial Forces, who at that time had gain’d some
advantage upon them: But not long after _Hartogen-bosch_ being taken by
the _Hollanders_, the rest of the expected Fleet, with the promis’d Aid,
arriv’d at _St. Vincent_; from whence _Loncque_, after four Moneths
stay, set Sail with these additional Forces, his Fleet then consisting
of fifty Sail of Ships, which carry’d above seven thousand Soldiers,
besides Seamen; but he was forc’d to lie a considerable time under the
_Line_, being either becalm’d or beaten back by contrary Winds, insomuch
that many of his Men perish’d, or were disabled with the Scurvey: At
last his Fleet being come to an Anchor upon the Coast of _Pernambuco_,
the first that Landed about two Leagues Northward of _Olinda_, was
Colonel _Diederik van Waerdenberg_, who by Day-break divided his Men
into three Divisions, the Forlorn-Hope consisting of nine hundred and
thirty four Men, march’d towards _Olinda_ along the Shore, led by _Adolf
van der Eltz_; the second being a thousand and forty nine, by _Stein
Callenfels_; the third, consisting of nine hundred and sixty five, was
led by _Fouke Honx_: thus drawn out, and marching on, they met with no
resistance till they came to the River _Dolce_, where eight hundred
_Portuguese_ Charg’d on them from behind a new Sconce; but _Waerdenberg_
wading up to the Middle through the River with two Field-Pieces, the
Enemy left his Works and ran into the Wood; the Forlorn-Hope approaching
the City, march’d up towards the right side, up a Way through the Woods,
Scal’d the Walls, near which the _Jesuits_ Cloyster stood, over which he
got after some resistance. The second Party march’d in a narrow Path
along the Shore, and broke into the City between the _Franciscans_ and
_Jesuits_ Cloyster, towards the Cathedral _Salvador_, from whence they
discharg’d several Guns, as also from the Castle, which they had taken,
whilest _Fouke Honx_ Storm’d the Battlements towards the South; but
_Stein Callenfels_ and _Eltz_ being already Masters of _Olinda_, the
Defendants surrendred all. Mean while the Colonel’s Skiff brought five
hundred Men more ashore, with which he march’d without any hinderance
into the City, where the Conquerors, faint with excessive Heat and want
of Water, found but little Booty, because the Inhabitants having notice
of the _Hollanders_ coming, had convey’d all their Goods and Wealth to
_Reciffa_, which the Governor _Matthias Albuquerque_ (Brother to the
Lord _Duarte Albuquerque_, to whom _Pernambuco_ properly belong’d) burnt
with all the Store-houses, partly out of revenge to the Inhabitants, who
fled contrary to his Commands, and partly because he would not enrich
the _Hollanders_. The _Portuguese_ Captain, _Correa de Castel Blanco_,
in his Letter to the King of _Spain_, values the loss at twenty hundred
thousand _Ducats_. But still the _Portuguese_ had possession of several
Forts about the Countrey, whereof the most considerable was _St.
George_, whither _Stein Callenfels_ march’d in the Night with six
hundred Men, but his Ladders being too short, and the Hand-Granado’s not
easily taking fire, he was forc’d to Retreat; whereupon judging it most
convenient to besiege the Castle, he digg’d Trenches about the same; nor
was it long ere the Besieged desir’d Quarter, which being granted, they
march’d from thence with ninety Men. The Water Castle surrendring in
like manner, they found fifteen Brass Guns therein; and in that of _St.
George_ four thousand pound of Gun-powder, and twenty four Iron Guns.

When the _Netherland_ Forces Landed on _Pernambuco_, the _Portuguese_
inhabited eleven Towns, the chiefest whereof being _Olinda_, was
generally Garrison’d by four Companies of Armed Citizens, each
containing a hundred Men and three Companies of Soldiers: Amongst the
Citizens were two hundred Merchants, some of whom were judg’d to be
worth fifty thousand _Crusados_.

Southward from _Olinda_, between the River _Biberibe_ and the Ocean, was
a narrow Cawsey, at the end of which lay the populous Village _Reciffa_,
where the Ships lade and unlade. About the middle of the Cliff, being a
League long, is the Anchoring place for great Ships, call’d _Pozo_. At
the end of the fore-mention’d Cawsey against _Pozo_, appear’d a round
Tower of Fre-stone.

[Sidenote: The memorable Exploits of the _English_ under Captain _James
           Lancaster_.]

The Journal kept by the _English_ Fleet that came hither under the
Command of Captain _James Lancaster_, Anno 1595. makes mention of a Fort
which lay at the Mouth of the Haven before _Reciffa_, which the
_English_ valiantly Storm’d, notwithstanding six hundred Men and seven
Brass Guns might easily have made it invincible: But they conquering the
same, march’d up to _Olinda_, took the Suburb, consisting of a hundred
Houses, without any resistance, as also a great Booty, and the greater,
because the Goods of a rich _Carak_ which had some few days before
suffer’d Shipwrack, were kept there; they also took fifteen laden Ships,
and for thirty days kept the whole Countrey about _Olinda_ restless with
continual Alarms. Since this Invasion the _Portuguese_ built a third
Fort on _Reciffa_, so that the Ships must pass in between two Forts,
where the Channel is also full of Rocks, and consequently the more
dangerous.

From _Reciffa_ the Goods are sent in Barques or Lighters to _Olinda_,
between which and _St. Salvador_ run the two great Rivers _Francisco_
and _Real_, the first whereof retains its freshness twenty Leagues into
the Ocean.

Along the River _Popitinga_ stand many Sugar-Mills; and five Leagues
farther Northward beyond _Olinda_ the _Portuguese_ inhabit these
Villages, _viz._ _Garasu_, _Reciffa_, _Moribeca_, _Antonio de Cabo_,
_Miguel de Poyuca_, _Gonsalvo de Una_, _Povacon de Porto Calvo_, _Alagoa
del Nort_, and _Alagoa del Zur_, besides other _Brasilian_ Hamlets, and
above seventy Sugar-Mills.

[Sidenote: The nature of the Soil in _Pernambuco_.]

The County of _Pernambuco_ hath for the most part a good Soil, several
Plains, low Hills, and fruitful Valleys, abounding with fair Canes,
which also grow on the Mountains _Masurepe_, _Zebaatan_, _Poyuca_, and
_Moribeque_.

The Wilds of _El Gran Matto_, afford the best Wood, with which they
drive the greatest Trade in the Village _Laurenzo_. Whilest _Matthias
Albuquerque_ Intrench’d himself a League and a half Westward from
_Olinda_, by the Sugar-Mills belonging to _Francisco Montero_, with a
hundred _Portuguese_, and three times as many Armed _Brasilians_,
_Loncque_ finding that he could not long keep the City _Olinda_ against
the Enemy, caus’d the same to be pull’d down and burnt.

[Sidenote: _Sergippo del Rey._]

Between the Rivers _Francisco_ and _Real_, lies the Town _Sergippo del
Rey_, up in the Countrey near a small Rivulet, which at Spring-Tydes
hath fourteen Foot Water. The Woods round about feed wild Cattel, and
the Mountains contain Mines of Gold and Silver.

The first Plantation in _Brasile_ was in the Island _Itamaraca_, three
Leagues long and two broad, but extends its Jurisdiction along the Main
Coast, from which it is separated by a narrow River, which runs betwixt
both thirty five Leagues. The Countrey is eminent for twenty
Sugar-Mills, and abundance of _Brasile_ Wood.

[Sidenote: _Villa de Conception._]

The chief Town of this Island is call’d _Villa de Conception_ near the
Sea, which round about the Island is full of Rocks. The _French_
settling themselves here at first, were driven from thence by the
_Portuguese_. The Town it self, built on a Rock, hath a strong Castle on
the one side, erected near a shrubby Moor; to the Northward of which
_Stein Callenfels_ found a little Isle, scarce a Musquet-shot long,
which at High-water is overflown, and being full of small Trees makes a
Receptacle for Sea-Fowl, which flock thither about six a Clock in the
Evening to Roost on the Boughs, from which, when once setled to take
their repose, they will not stir till six of the Clock the next Morning,
though you discharge Guns at them all Night; but since _Stein
Callenfels_ cut down the Wood to make Pallisado’s for the new Fort
against the Town _Conception_, they were never seen afterwards.

                                Parayba.

[Sidenote: Description of _Parayba_.]

Northward from _Itamaraca_ borders the County of _Parayba_, whence the
_French_ Ships carry’d yearly several Ladings of _Brasile_ Wood, till
_Anno 1585._ the _Portuguese_ General _Martin Leytam_ drove them from
all places, since when they never recover’d any part thereof.

[Illustration: OSTIUM FLUMINES PARAYBÆ]

This Territory of _Parayba_ borrows its Denomination from the chief
Town, lying five Leagues from the North Sea near the River _Parayba_,
which in the Summer Season hath but little Water, but in the Winter
Season increases to that heighth, that it oftentimes on a sudden
overflowing the Countrey sweeps away both People, Cattel, and Houses.
The City it self, though small, yet hath several fair Buildings, amongst
which three Churches and as many Cloysters, inhabited by _Franciscans_,
_Carmelites_, and _Benedictins_, are none of the meanest. The Countrey
thereabouts indifferently fruitful, hath twenty Sugar-Mills. The
Mountain _Cupaguao_, formerly very populous with Natives, being
exceeding fertile, produces all manner of Fruit; at present it lies
desolate, the _Brasilians_ being all destroy’d by the _Portuguese_.
These Mountains produce also curious green Stones, which the Inhabitants
wore in their Lips for an Ornament, and which also cures the Griping of
the Guts, by being laid upon the Belly.

[Sidenote: The Silver-Mine _Copaoba_.]

The _French_ under the Command of Captain _Dourmigas_, discover’d ninety
years ago the Silver-Mine _Copaoba_, and for considerable time carry’d
Silver and _Brasile_ Wood from hence, till the _Portuguese_ made
themselves absolute Masters.

Moreover, on the North-side of _Parayba_, the Salvages call’d
_Petiguars_ inhabit sixteen Villages.

[Sidenote: Strange Birds.]

Amongst the Birds of prey which breed here, are the _Ouyaourassou_,
twice as big as a Crane, with curious Feathers, and so bold and strong,
that it devours not onely Sheep, but Deer and Men.

The Bird _Mayton_ is no way inferior in beauty to the Peacock, his whole
Body being cover’d with white and black Feathers; on his Head grows a
Tuft; the Flesh is also very pleasant to the taste.

The _Toucan_, another Bird, resembles a Turtle-Dove in all parts, except
the Bill and Breast; for the Belly is ten Inches long and three broad,
the Breast of an Orange colour, mix’d with Crimson Spots; the remaining
part is white, the Back red, and the Tail and Wings Coal-black.

[Sidenote: The Plant _Yarammacarou_.]

The Plant call’d _Yarammacarou_ deserves also a peculiar observation,
_viz._ It is thicker than a Man’s Thigh, grows twelve Foot high, with
three Branches of equal length and thickness, which you may easily
break; it is green without, white within, and without Leaves, leaving
red Blossoms streak’d with blue, from whence grows a Fruit about the
bigness of an Apple, crimson without and white within, and tasting like
a Mulberry.

[Sidenote: The _Guara-tereba_, with other strange Fish.]

The River _Parayba_ produces amongst many other Fishes the
_Guara-tereba_, which hath a thick Body, flat Head, crooked Back, split
Tail, and triangular Scales, which laid in the Sun, shine like polish’d
Gold.

The Sea also hereabouts affords a strange Fish with a very long and thin
Tail, the Females whereof Lay every day Eggs like Hens: they are full of
poysonous Prickles, and divided into several sorts, amongst which the
chiefest are accounted the _Naainari_ and _Jabebara_.


[Sidenote: Description of the Sea Coast of _Brasile_.]

[Sidenote: Strange Tree.]

The Sea-Coast of _Brasile_ from _St. Vincent_ to _Spirito Santo_ appears
as followeth: Before the Coast of _St. Vincent_ lie the four little
Isles _Queimadas_, and on one side the _Alcatraces_ and _Busios_; East
North-East from which bears the Island _Sebastian_: Before the Inlet
_Ubatuba_ lies the Isle _Dos Porcos_, close under a high Shore, where
the Haven runs far up in the Countrey. Fourteen Leagues farther the
Island _Grande_, stor’d with fresh Water, with Fish-ponds, Woods, and
two good Havens. Before the Road of _Garatuba_ appear several broken
Isles, the chiefest whereof is _Morambaya_. The Ships Sailing along the
_Brasilian_ Coast view next the Mouth of the wide River _Jenero_,
without fear of Rocks or Shoals. Moreover, a sandy Ground extends from
the Western Point to _Cape Frio_, which rises out of the Sea like a
Rock, with white Streaks, and crack’d on the top, between both which the
high Island before _Frio_ makes a safe Harbor. Nine Leagues beyond
_Frio_ to the Northward, _St. Salvador_ opens a large Bay, hemm’d in on
the South by divers nameless Isles. Lastly, the several Salt-pans along
this Coast are very remarkable, as also the Promontory _St.Thoma_ and
_Parayba_, the Inlets _Manangea_ and _Itapemeri_, and the River
_Guarapari_, famous for the Mountain _Pero Cam_ towards the North, and
_Guapel_ to the South. The Island _Salvago_, round and mountainous, lies
before the Mouth of the River _Guarapari_, where the Main Coast grows
uneven and Hilly. On the North-East Point of _Spirito Santo_ a long
ridge of Rocks appears above the Sea; and near the Inlet rises three
black Hills on the South, and two Leagues up in the Countrey the broken
Mountain _Mestre Alvaro_, which extends along the Sea-Coast. The River
_Des Reyos Magos_ encompasses three Mountains severally, and makes three
Isles. The Coast on each side of the River _Dolce_ is very plain and
even, but _Cricare_ hath a mixture of high and low Lands. In the Mouth
of the River _Maranipe_ lies a great company of white Shelves near
together, appearing afar off as if all one. _Parairepe_ is remarkable by
the high Trees growing on it. The Mouth of the River _Caruvelas_ lies
full of Sand-plats. Near the Beacon _Tauhaen_ rises a red Cliff from
which a sandy Point reaches to the River _Curubabo_. Before _Porto
Seguro_ lie several dangerous Rocks in the Sea, to the Southward of
which rises the High-land _Cape Pasqual_. Not far from hence _Santa
Cruiz_ a good Haven for small Vessels, from whence the Coast extends
North North-East, and South South-West, to _Rio Grande_, where the
Shoals call’d _Baxos de St. Antonio_, making a dangerous Entry, force
the Ships for the most part to keep three Leagues from the Shore. Beyond
the Arm of _Rio Grande_ appear three high Mountains cover’d with Trees;
from whence to _Ilheos_ is a safe Passage free from Shelves. Eight
Leagues farther, the River _Dos Contas_ runs between two broken Cliffs
into the Sea: in the Mouth of it rises a Rock resembling a high Island.
Between _Ilheos_ and _Contas_ the Coast rises also, but falls low again
in a Bay, where white Sugar-Mills, formerly belonging to _Lucas
Giraldes_, are seen at a great distance. The Countrey on each side of
the River _Camanu_ is plain; the Stream it self hath a wide Mouth, and
respects with its Northern Shore the Isle _Cayepa_, dangerous for the
many Shelves which are about the same. The River _Tinhare_ is known by
the Mountain _Morro de Santo Paulo_, which rises like a Galley on the
Southern Shore. Twelve Leagues farther opens the Bay of _Todos los
Sanctos_, on whose Eastern Point stands the Castle _Antonio_, and before
the Northern Shore the Island _Topoam_, to the East and South-East low
and strong. The River _Das Pedras_ falls with a wide Mouth into the
Ocean. Next you pass by the Streams _Tapicuru_, _Real Vasabaris_ and
_Francisco_, known by a low Promontory. The Rivers _Miguel_, _Antonio_,
_Camaragili_, _Porto Calvo_, _Formoso_, and _Serinhaem_, disembogue also
into the Sea. Next the Stream _Das Pedras_ rises the Promontory _St.
Augustine_, all overgrown with Bushes and Brambles. Five Leagues
Southward lies the small Isle _Alexo_. The Coast from _St. Augustine_ to
_Pernambuco_ extends North and by East, and South and by West. The
Island _Tamaraca_ lies in the Mouth of the Stream _Gajana_; and fifteen
Leagues farther appears _Parayba_; between which two the Shelf _Pedra
Furada_ extends three Leagues along the Coast, and another from the
Shore of the Promontory _Blanco_, where the Road _Porto de Franeses_
affords Seamen secure Anchorage for Shipping. Next to _Parayba_ follow
the Havens _Treicaon_, _Pipa_, and _Basios_, the Stream _Siara_ and
_Maragnan_, which washes the Western part of _Brasile_, and is taken for
the Boundary between the _Spanish Indies_ and the _Portuguese_,
according to the Division by Pope _Alexander_ the Sixth, _Anno 1502._
Lastly, there belongs to _Brasile_ the Island _Fernando de Noronho_, in
three Degrees of Southern Latitude. The Capuchin, _Claude de Abbeville_,
going thither, found the same to be six Leagues in circumference, and
extraordinary fruitful; besides good fresh Water, Pease, Beans, _Maiz_,
Potato’s, Melons, Cotton, Cattel, wild Goats, and all sorts of Poultrey,
which this Island affords; but it chiefly abounds with great variety of
a sort of Birds which suffer themselves to be caught with the Hand.
There grows likewise a nameless Tree, not unlike the Laurel, being of a
strange Nature, for who e’re touches the Leaves, and afterwards rubs his
Eyes, loses his Sight for four hours, with exceeding pain; which pain
nevertheless another Tree growing in the same Island cures immediately.
The _French_, who Landed on _Noronho_ Anno 1613. found a _Portuguese_
there, with eighteen _Brasilians_, Men, Women, and Children, banish’d
thither from _Pernambuco_, whom Baptizing, they carry’d to _Maragnan_.
Near _Noronho_ lies the Isle _De Feu_.


                                SECT. X.
                               Maragnan.

[Sidenote: Situation.]

_Maragnan_, forty five Leagues in circumference, lies in two Degrees of
Southern Latitude, and a considerable distance from the Bay, which
appears between the Rivers _Aperegha_ and _Comajamu_.

The Eastern Entrance into this Bay hath before the Promontory _Arbres
Secs_, the Isle _St. Anna_, by the _Brasilians_ call’d _Upaonmiri_.

Opposite to _Maragnan_, about half way from the said Inlet, fall three
Rivers into the Sea, the most Easterly call’d _Mounin_, hath a Mouth a
Mile wide, and discharges its Water into the Sea; the middlemost
_Taboucourou_, is five hundred Leagues long, and ends with two Mouths,
half a League distant one from the other; the most Westerly, call’d
_Miary_, is about six Leagues broad, so falling into the Sea.

The Stream _Maracou_ falls into the _Pinare_, and thus united they joyn
both with the _Miary_, which runs exceeding swift into the Sea.

Between the Capes _Arbres Secs_ and _De la Tortue_, the Coast lies full
of sandy Banks, some of which extend a League into the Ocean.

On the other side of the Promontory _Tapoytapere_ near _Maragnan_,
towards the River of _Amazones_, lie so many Isles along the Sea-shore,
that no Ship is able to approach the same, because the Spaces between
the Isles are overgrown with Trees call’d _Apparituriers_, whose Boughs
shooting down and rooting in the Sea, produce other Trees, which grow so
close together, that they seem one entire Tree with many Branches.
Besides this Inconvenience there is abundance of drift Sand when the
Wind sits from the Shore, which oftentimes swallows the Ships which lie
upon the same.

Beyond _Maragnan_ lie two Roads, the first between the Promontory
_Arbres_ and the Isle _St. Anna_, but dangerous; the other, discover’d
some years since, reaches to the Fort of _Maragnan_, and is as dangerous
as the first.

This Island hath twenty seven Villages, by the Natives call’d _Oc_ or
_Tave_, each Village consisting of four Houses made of great Stakes, and
cover’d with Palm-tree Leaves against the Rain, each House being thirty
Foot broad, and from two hundred to five hundred Paces long, according
to the greater or lesser number of Inhabitants. The first Village,
opposite to _St. Anna_, is call’d _Timbohu_; the second, well known for
two eminent Fishing-places, is _Itapara_; but the two biggest are
_Juniparan_ and _Eussaouap_, each having about five or six hundred
Inhabitants.

This Island of _Maragnan_ lies under a temperate Climate, being seldom
troubled with excessive Colds, Droughts, pestilential Vapors, Wind,
Hail, or Thunder, only it Lightens Morning and Evening in serene
Weather. When the Sun returns from the _Tropick_ of _Capricorn_ to the
North, then it Rains for six Weeks together; but when he declines from
_Cancer_ towards the Southern _Solstice_, the _Trade_-Wind, or Eastern
Breezes rise at seven of the Clock in the Morning, but grow fainter
towards Sun-setting.

[Sidenote: Fruitful Soil and rich Coast of _Maragnan_.]

The Soil of _Maragnan_ is exceeding fruitful, producing abundance of
_Brasile_ Wood, Sugar, Cotton, the red Colour _Roucou_, Tobacco, Balsam
not inferior to the _Arabian_, Pepper, and all manner of Fruits. On the
Coast is often found excellent Amber-greece and Jasper Stones, which the
Inhabitants wore in their Lips. In some places along the Sea-shore
appear Rocks of red and white Stone _Diaphanous_, like Crystal, which
(some say) are as hard as Diamonds, and call’d _Allencon_. The Woods
produce Timber, and the Shore Stones and Shells, of which they make
Mortar. There are also several pleasant Fields and Hills, whose Feet are
wash’d by delightful Brooks, along which they pass in _Canoos_ from one
Village to another. The Woods consist most of Palm-Trees, amongst which
breed all sorts of Fowls and Beasts.

[Sidenote: Fruit-Trees.]

The chiefest of the Fruit-Trees which grow here is the _Accayou_, which
being much bigger than our Pomewaters, hath Leaves not unlike those of
an Oak: and also a Nut resembling a Sheeps Kidney, cover’d with a hard
Shell, which incloses an oylie Pith. Out of these the Islanders press a
very wholsom and pleasant Liquor; as also out of the _Pacoeira_ and
_Bannanas_, both excellent Plants, which will grow in any Ground. This
Plant they pluck up by the Roots wild as soon as it hath put forth three
Leaves; which Leaves being rowl’d up hard together like a Twig, are
again Set, and then sprout up each with ten green Leaves, which when
mov’d by the Wind, rattle like Parchment, and tear very easily: the
Stalk is an Inch thick, from which spread several lesser Branches; under
the Leaves hang yellowish Flowers of a pleasant smell, at whose Stalks
are lesser Leaves resembling little Scoups, full of Juice, in taste like
Honey, and in colour like the White of an Egg: after the Flower follows
the Fruit, very like a Cucumber, onely they are three square, and have a
hardish Shell, which incloses a well tasted and wholsom Pulp, which
commonly grows in Clusters. This Plant, when the Fruit is ripe, is
pluck’d up, from whence another springs up immediately, which bears the
like Fruit the next year; so that this Plant lives as it were by
propagation continually.

The _Bannanas_ bear Leaves of a Fathom long and two Foot broad; the
Fruit is very like that of the _Pacoeira_.

The _Mangaa_ is very like the Apricock both in taste and form.

The Tree _Jaracaha_ hath a spread Crown, leaves like those of a
Fig-Tree, yellow Flowers, and Pears with Shells, and full of Kernels.

The _Ouaieroua_ is an exceeding sweet-smelling Tree, bears a Fruit much
bigger than the greatest Melons.

The _Junipap_, which is much taller, hath Apples, which whilest they are
green are best, yielding a Juice which Dyes Coal-black, and therefore is
us’d by the Natives to paint their Bodies with: The Apples when ripe are
yellow within and without, very well tasted, and melting in the Mouth.

Besides these fore-mention’d Fruit-Trees there are several others that
grow on this Island, amongst which is the _Vua-pirup_, eminent for its
Blossom, which is yellow, blue, and red, and bears delicate Apples,
which ripen best in the rainy Season.

Lastly, the _Pekey_, which three Men cannot Fathom, bears a Fruit of two
handfuls bigness, having a hard thick Shell, and within four Kidney-like
Kernels, each concealing a prickly Stone, which hurts the Mouths of
unwary Eaters.

The Plant _Carouata_ hath Leaves an Ell long, and two Inches broad; they
are very thick and thistly from the middle, and about two Foot from the
Ground grows an exceeding pleasant Fruit, yellow without and within,
three square, a Finger long, and hanging oftentimes sixty in a Cluster.

_Vua_, a sort of Melons, green without, and within full of white Pulp
and black Kernels, and hath a pleasant Juice, dissolves to Water, if cut
in the middle, sweeter than Sugar, and very refreshing.

_Manioch_, a thick Root of the Plant _Manicup_, Leav’d like a Fig-Tree;
being ground to Meal, it serves in stead of Bread.

Besides these already mention’d, there are several other Plants, the
most usual are the great flat Beans call’d _Commanda-ouassou_, and the
long Pease _Commanda-miry_.

[Sidenote: Strange Birds.]

Here are variety of Birds of several sorts, especially of Parrots, which
flye in great Companies, most beautiful to the Eye, and very docible to
speak, and also good for Food.

The Partridges _Nanbououassou_, in bigness no way inferior to a Capon,
have blue Feathers, and also Lay blue Eggs.

The _Ourou_, resembling a Partridge, hath a Combe like a Cock, but mix’d
with three Colours, _viz._ red, black, and white.

The Bats, nam’d _Andheura_, have a mournful Note in the Night, often
biting those they find asleep, and suck their Blood so hard that it can
hardly be stopt.

The Ostriches here call’d _Yandou_, being as tall as a middle-siz’d Man,
cannot flye, but run as swift as a Greyhound.

Their Fowl call’d _Falian_, with long Bills and Cranes Legs, flies very
low, but runs so swift that a Horse can scarce overtake them.

[Sidenote: Strange sorts of Fish.]

The Ocean about _Maragnan_ produces abundance of all sorts of Fish, and
amongst others the _Pyraon_, six Foot long, thicker than a Barrel, and
cover’d with black Scales of a hand-breadth.

The Fish _Camouroupouy_ differs not much from the _Pyraon_, onely in
having fewer Scales.

The _Ougry_, four Foot long, hath a broad Head, and two sharp Fins on
the Back, which wound terribly. This Fish also swimming in the River,
smells of Musk whilest it stays therein.

The like length hath also the _Camboury Ouassou_, whose Hog-like Head,
and yellow scal’d Tail, makes it seem like a Monster.

The _Yauebouyre_ is a Foot in thickness, in length two Fathom, and a
Fathom in breadth, and hath a Tail of half a Fathom long, out of the
middle of which flicks a sharp and great Bone, which makes such
dangerous Wounds, that if any part of a Man’s Body be touch’d therewith,
it must be cut off.

The _Narinnary_, which is much lesser, wounds with its Sting very
dangerously.

The flat Fish _Acaraiou_ hath the length of a Foot, a green Head, thick
Scales, a yellow Back, and white Belly.

The _Araououa_ hath a hard Skin, is eight times bigger than the
_Acaraiou_ and hath a three-pointed Sword, with which it kills other
Fish.

Another sort of Sword-fish is the _Panapans_, whose Sword is a Foot less
than that of the _Araououa_.

The _Picamo_ and _Caramourou_ resemble the Pilchard, and are taken in
great abundance near the Rocks.

The Rivers and Brooks on _Maragnan_ are also very full of Fish, amongst
which the _Pourake_, four Foot long, full of green, blue, red and white
Specks and Streaks, the Skin so hard that no Sword can penetrate it;
wherefore it regards not a blow, but if it moves, it causes such a pain
on the Arm of him that strikes, that he falls down on the Ground.

The _Caurimata_, which is very like a Carp, is the most delicious Fish
that ever was tasted.

The _Pyrain_, without Scales, colour’d red and yellow, hath sharp Teeth,
which cut sloapingly; as also the _Opean_, _Tarehure_, _Paraty_, and
_Jerou_.

The red Crabs _Oussa_, with hairy Legs, breed about the Roots of the
fore-mention’d Trees that grow in the Water.

The white Crabs _Aouara-oussa_ carry the Amber-greece, cast on the
Shores to their Holes.

They have also good Mussles, and well rellish’d Oysters sticking on the
Boughs of the said Trees.

During the rainy Season there are generally standing Pools, in which
yearly breed many Fishes, which are taken up by the Inhabitants when the
Pools begin to dry.

[Sidenote: Divers kinds of strange Beasts.]

Moreover, this Island feeds abundance of four-footed Beasts, amongst
which their wild Deer, Rabbets and Hares, differ little from the
_European_. They have also wild Swine call’d _Taiassou_, who seem to
have Navels on their Backs, which cast a sweet Musky smell; besides
another sort of Swine, not inferior to the former, but of a stranger
shape, being Mouth’d like a Hare, with two long Tusks in their upper
Jaws, and two beneath; their Ears like a Mans; the foremost Feet white,
and hoof’d like an Ass; the hindermost part of their Body like a Bear,
and full of Bristles, half white and half black, three handfuls long:
when they creep in their Holes their staring Bristles fall; they keep
much amongst Brambles, feed on Apples and Roots; In the Winter Season
they Stye themselves up in their Holes.

Here are also Pismire-eaters, call’d _Tamandua_, with a Boars Head, Dogs
Ears, sharp Snout, Horses Hair, and Ox Feet.

The _Tapiyre-ete_ differ little from wild Cows, onely they have shorter
Legs and Tails, and wanting Horns, are Arm’d in stead thereof with
Teeth; in their Heads are often found a Stone like the _Bezoar_ Stone.

Several sorts of _Armadillo_’s here differ much in form each from the
other.

The wild Cats _Margaia_ are caught for their curious Skin.

The Foxes _Janovare_, and Leopards _Sovassovaran_, both curiously
mark’d, are very ravenous.

Here is also a deform’d slow creeping Beast call’d _Ai_, whose Head is
like a Mans, and cover’d with rough and grey Hair, on each Foot three
Claws close together, and at least a Finger long, sharp Teeth, a smooth
high black Nose, little drowsie Eyes, no Ears, a Tail small above and
broad at the bottom, long Ash-colour’d Hair over all the Body; and being
about the bigness of a Fox, it climbs slowly up the Trees, and comes not
down before it hath eaten off all the Leaves; it feeds also on Earth,
and sometimes sits on a high Bough without Meat twenty days together; it
goes so softly, that it will hardly clear fifty Paces in twenty four
hours.

On this Island are likewise all sorts of Apes and Monkies, amongst which
is one most remarkable, call’d _The Zimme Cayon_, hairy all over, with a
long white Beard, an old Mans Face, bald Ears, black Eyes and long Tail,
which they wind about a Bough, and so hanging, swing themselves from one
Tree to another; they are very fierce as well as subtile, for being
wounded with an Arrow, they set upon their Enemy without the least fear;
when they climb up the Trees, they carry their Mouths and Hands full of
Stones to throw at Travellers; and if any one of them chance to be
wounded, all the rest that are near come to help him, and stop the Wound
with Leaves, and the like; the young ones hang upon the Backs of their
Dams, who run very swift with them, and leap from one Tree to another.

[Illustration]

_Juan Ardenois_ relates, That the _Coyons_ play at certain Games with
the Natives for Money, and spend what they win in publick Houses.

_Joseph de Acosta_ tells us, That one of these kind of Creatures being
sent to a Tavern for Wine, would not part with his Money before his Pot
was fill’d, which he defended from the Boys that offer’d to take it from
him, by throwing Stones at them; and though it lov’d Wine very well, yet
brought it always home without tasting.

It is no less wonderful what _Peter Martyr_ relates of one of these
Creatures, _viz._ That observing one ready to fire a Gun at him, before
he could discharge, it leap’d from the Tree and snatch’d up a Child,
which he held as a Buckler before him.

[Sidenote: The _Sagovin_.]

The _Sagovin_ resembles a Lyon in the fore-part of the Body, with shaggy
Hair; they are exceeding dainty and tender, yet so stubborn and sullen,
that they take pet at the least affront, and often pine themselves away
and die with hunger.

[Sidenote: The _Boyete_, and other sorts of Serpents.]

The Serpent _Boy-ete_, two Fathoms long, without Legs, having a bright
speckled Skin and four sharp Teeth, wounds also mortally with its Tail;
but is the less dangerous, because at the end of the Tail grows a
Bladder, which moving rattles as if there were Pease in it, which gives
notice to the Traveller, though unwary, by which means he makes his
escape.

The other Serpents call’d _Jouboy_, _Tara-gouyboy_, and _Tarehuboy_,
serve the Natives for a great Delicacy; as also the great Toads or
Frogs, call’d _Tourourou_.

They have also a sort of Flies call’d _Ton_, which exceedingly molest
them, against which their chiefest Medicine is Palm-tree Oyl, and the
_Roucou_, with which they colour their Skins.

The Natives of this Island of _Maragnan_, driven out of the pleasant
Countrey _Cayete_ by the _Portuguese_, are a sort of the _Toupinambas_,
who Setled here about a hundred and fifty years ago. The time of their
first coming hither us’d formerly to be solemniz’d with the great Feast
call’d _Caoven_; but because a Woman boldly set upon a Commander in his
Cups, there arose a great Tumult amongst them, and ever since the Island
hath been divided, one Party calling the other _Tobaiares_, that is, _We
are Enemies_: They are so inveterate against one another, that who e’re
they take Prisoners they unmercifully devour: Both are of a middle
Stature, have flat Noses, which the Midwives make at the Birth of the
Child, they are generally a strong People, and many of them living a
hundred years, without being grey, bald, or sick; they live temperate,
and under a wholsom Climate: Some of their Women bear Children (as they
say) till they are eighty years of age, which being born white, turn to
be of a Tawny colour, by being anointed with Suet call’d _Roucon_, and
Oyl; otherwise they are well proportion’d. The Men pluck out all the
Hair of their Foreheads, but suffer it to hang pretty long over their
Ears, and behind. The Women let their Hair hang down to their Middle,
and wear woodden Ear-rings, but the Men hang green Beads in their Lips,
and thrust little Bones through their Noses. They go all stark naked,
their Legs are colour’d black with the Juice of the Herb _Junipap_, and
upon the other parts of their Body appear Figures of several
Representations. Those that will manifest their Valor, and be accounted
hardy, gash their Bodies all over with Wounds, which they heal in such a
manner, that the Scars may more plainly appear. They never come to their
usual Feasts, but dress’d up in various colour’d Feathers; upon the
Crown of their Heads they wear Caps stuck with Plumes, which they call
_Acangoap_, or Coronets, call’d _Acangerar_; about their Necks, the
Necklaces _Aiouacava_; over their Shoulders, the Mantles _Assoyave_;
their Garters they call _Tabacoura_, at which they hang hollow Nutshells
full of little Stones, which gingle and rattle as they go, and about
their Arms Armlets call’d _Mapouyh-couaychovare_; all which are
curiously checker’d with various colour’d Feathers.

The _Maragnans_ live not much up in the Countrey, but rather on the
Sea-Coast, because of their Fishing, removing every sixth year, calling
the Village where they Settle, by the former Name.

They take every Man as many Wives as he pleaseth, but the Women must
stick each to one Man, unless she be Divorc’d from him, which often
happens upon small occasions.

Their Cotton Hammocks call’d _Yu_, on which they sleep, hang between two
Stakes, in which they lie.

Singular Friends and Relations Feast one another daily; but they are
cruel and revengeful against their neighboring Enemies, whom, when they
take any of them, they fatten, kill, and eat. The least affront done
them, or injurious word spoken to them, or against their Predecessors,
makes them take up Arms, which consist of Bowes and Arrows, which they
call _Ouyrapar_ and _Oune_.

Here the _French_ have built the Fort _St. Lovis_ on an Island, from
whence Westward may be seen the Cape _Tapouytapere_, which at High-water
seems like an Island, and lies four Leagues from thence; at Low-water
they can walk over the Sands from the same to the Main Land.

This fruitful Countrey hath twenty populous Villages.

Westward lies _Comma_, which gives Denomination to the chief Village,
the River, and the rest of that Countrey, wherein are sixteen more
handsom Villages, better built, and more populous than _Maragnan_ or
_Tapouytapere_.

Concerning the building of the fore-mention’d Fort on _Maragnan_, it
hapned as followeth:

[Sidenote: The occasion of building the Fort _Maragnan_.]

[Sidenote: A Colony of _French_ sent over into the Island of
           _Maragnan_.]

[Sidenote: Driven out by the _Portuguese_.]

[Illustration: I TAMARACA]

[Illustration: FL VIUS GRANDIS]

[Illustration: SIARA]

The _French_ Captain _Riffaut_, upon the Advice of _Ouyrapive_, who bore
a great sway amongst his _Maragnan_ Subjects, fitted out three Ships;
but because of a Contention between the Sea-men, and the loss of his
chiefest Vessel, he was forc’d to Sail to _France_, and leave some of
his Men on _Maragnan_, under the Command of a young Gentleman call’d _De
Vaux_, who carry’d himself so discreetly amongst the Islanders, that
they promis’d to embrace the _Christian_ Religion, if new Supplies came
from _France_ to assist them against their Enemies; of which _De Vaux_
advis’d the _French_ King _Henry_ the Fourth, who approv’d of it, and
sent Monsieur _De la Ravardiere_ to _Maragnan_, to make a farther
Enquiry into the whole Matter, where he spent six Moneths; after which
returning he found the King murder’d, wherefore the Business lay dead
for a while; but at length _Ravardiere_ took with him the Lord
_Rosilly_, and the Baron of _Sansi_, desiring some _Capuchins_ of the
Queen-Mother, for the promulgating of the _Christian_ Religion in
_Maragnan_; which being granted, they set Sail with three Ships _Anno
1612._ with which arriving safely there, and Landing, he built next the
chiefest Haven the Fort _St. Lewis_ on a Hill, by whose foot two Rivers
glide into the Ocean. After which this new Plantation went on for a
considerable time, till the _Portuguese_ overpowering them, drove them
out of this their new Field, making themselves absolute Masters of the
Fort, and also of the great Mountain _Ibouyapap_, four Leagues high,
plain on the top, twenty four Leagues long, and little less in breadth.
No Champain under the Sun is more pleasant and fruitful than this; for
in some places it is shaded with Trees, in others hath brave Pastures,
lies under a wholsom Climate, and abounds with fresh Springs, from
whence are deriv’d store of Brooks, and Rivulets full of Fish.


                               SECT. XI.
          The Lordships Tamarica, Rio Grande, Siara, and Para.

[Sidenote: Description of the Lordship of _Tamarica_.]

The _Præfecture_ of _Tamarica_, not above three Leagues in length and
two in breadth, so call’d from a little Island lying before it, and part
of its Precinct, is counted the first, that is, the most ancient
Lordship of _Brasile_, having otherwise nothing in it that is very
considerable, save onely a good Haven or Port, with a Castle for the
Security or Command of it, held to be impregnable, and so found by the
_Dutch_, who under _Peter Heyn_ and _Stein Callenfels_ in vain attempted
the taking of it, as shall be mention’d hereafter more particularly, but
made it useless to the _Portuguese_, by making a Bulwark at the Mouth of
the Haven, and so blocking it up.

This _Capatania_ yielded formerly a Rent of thirty thousand _Ducats_ to
the Earls of _Montesanto_, whose Right it was.


[Sidenote: Description of the Lordship of _Rio Grande_.]

The _Præfecture_ of _Rio Grande_, a small Precinct, so denominated, as
lying on the South-side of that great River which the _Portuguese_ call
_Rio Grande_, and the Natives _Potingi_, where it falls into the Sea,
was once possess’d by the _French_ about the Year 1597. who were outed
by the _Portuguese_, and the Place fortifi’d both against them and the
Salvages, (of whom they slew and took Prisoners very great numbers) with
a Castle, which the _Dutch_ in the Year 1631. found an impregnable
piece, and too hard for them to take.


[Sidenote: Description of the Lordship of _Siara_.]

The _Præfecture_ of _Siara_, so denominated from the Haven; it hath long
been in the possession of the _Portuguese_, but they have therein no
Towns of note, onely a Castle, and some few Houses for those that attend
the gathering of Cotton-Wool, and Manuring of the Sugar-Canes, which are
here in great abundance, also the Countrey is said to afford some
Crystal and other Precious Stones.


[Sidenote: Description of the Lordship of _Para_.]

Lastly, the _Præfecture_ of _Para_ is the most Northerly part of
_Brasile_, bordering upon _Guiana_, so call’d from the River _Para_,
which runneth through the midst of it, upon which, in a convenient
place, and upon rais’d Ground, the _Portuguese_ have built a very strong
Castle, well Wall’d on all sides, save onely towards the River, where it
is planted with Ordnance: It is built in a quadrangular form, and hath
at least three hundred Persons of the _Portuguese_ Nation (besides the
Garrison Soldiers) belonging to it, who have all Employment enough about
the Cotton-Wool, Sugar-Canes, and Tobacco, which the Countrey is said to
afford in great plenty.


 _A Relation of the Proceedings of the_ Netherland West-India _Company
                    in_ Brasile _to the Year 1658_.

The chief Disturbers of the _Portuguese_ in the possession of the
Countrey of _Brasile_, were the _United Netherlanders_; for they having
had good success with their first Fleet, under the Command of _John
Molenaer_, _John Dignumszoon_, _John Schelinger_, _Simon Mau_, and the
Merchants _Cornelis Woodman_, _Gerard Beveningen_, and _Heinier van
Hel_, Anno 1595. in the _East-Indies_, where they got such footing, that
they took whole Kingdoms, to the great enriching of the Eastern World,
where they spread their Trade over the whole Countrey, were thereupon
emboldned to venture also to the West, that thereby they might cut off
the Sinews of the King of _Spain_’s Wars, he being continually supply’d
with Treasures from _America_.

[Sidenote: A _West-India_ Company erected by the _United States_.]

[Sidenote: _St. Salvador_ set upon by the _Dutch_ under _Peterszoon_ and
           _Willekens_.]

[Sidenote: _St. Salvador_ taken by the _Dutch_.]

The grand Promoters of this Design were the Company of Merchants, who
hitherto had Traded to _Guinee_; and the rather, because _Guinee_
brought them but little Profit. But to set upon the _Spanish_ Power, was
a Business of no small Consequence; nevertheless they undertaking it,
obtain’d Letters Patents from the _States_ of the _United Netherlands_,
Anno 1621. for erecting of a _West-India_ Company, in which it was
declar’d, That none without the said Companies leave should drive any
Trade to _Africa_ from the Northern _Tropick_, to the Cape _Bonne
Esperance_; nor to _America_ from _Terre-Neuf_ to the _Straights_ of
_Magellan_, or _Le Maire_; nor in the South Sea to _Anian_; which if any
attempted, they should forfeit Ship and Goods; besides several other
Priviledges and Immunities granted towards the promoting and
establishing of the said Company. After a long Consultation which way to
steer their Course, it was concluded upon in the Council for the Affairs
of the Company, to Invade _St. Salvador_ in the Inlet _Todos los
Sanctos_, whether they sent twenty Men of War and three Ketches,
Commanded by _Jacob Willekens_, and _Peter Peterszoon Hein_; the Land
Forces being under the Command of Colonel _John van Dorth_. In the
beginning of the Year 1624. the Fleet set Sail out of the _Texel_ and
the _Maes_, and in five Moneths arriv’d at _St. Salvador_. As soon as
the _Portugueses_ discover’d the _Dutch_ Fleet, they shot without
ceasing from the Fort _Philippo_ with three Brass Guns, as also from the
Castle _Tapagipe_, with four Demi-Canons, but chiefly from the
Battlement rais’d threesquare out of the Water before _St. Salvador_,
from whence they play’d at them with twelve great Guns, whilest the
Vice-Admiral ran within Musquet-shot of the said Battlement with three
Ships, and found fifteen _Portuguese_ Vessels lying near the Shore not
far from the Castle _Philippo_, where there began a sharp Conflict, to
the no small advantage of _Peter Hein_; who thereupon ventur’d with
three Boats to Board the fifteen Ships: which resolute Attempt of the
_Dutch_ Seamen so amaz’d the _Portuguese_, that they set their biggest
Ships on Fire, and fled ashore: Those Ships that escap’d, being in all
ten, the _Hollanders_ took and brought them to the Fleet. This flight of
the _Portuguese_ encouraging _Peter Hein_, he went with fourteen Boats,
each Mann’d with two hundred Arm’d Men upon the very Mouths of the
Cannons to the fore-mention’d Battlement and took the same,
notwithstanding the Stone Wall rose eight Foot out of the Water, and
above a hundred _Portuguese_ defended it, whilest the Admiral
_Willekens_ sent twelve hundred Soldiers, and two hundred and forty
Seamen ashore with Field-Pieces. The Forlorn-Hope consisted of sixty
Musquetteers, led by Captain _Helmond_, who was seconded by Lieutenant
_La Main_, all the Seamen following with Spades and Pick-axes; the
Reserve was brought up by Captain _Kyf_, _Ysenach_, and _William
Schouten_; thus drawn out, they were led towards the City by the Guides
_Dirk Colver_ and _Dirk de Ruiter_, along a narrow Way, which the
_Portuguese_ might have guarded with a few Men, had they not been all
struck with a pannick fear, and making use of the dark Night, fled into
the Woods. The _Dutch_ found in the City an incredible Booty, because
the Governor _Diego Mendoza de Furtado_ had forbid the carrying away of
any Goods, that so the Citizens might be the easier perswaded to defend
the City; which they might well have done, had they not been surpris’d
with the suddenness of the Action; for when _Willekens_ Anchor’d here,
there were above sixteen hundred Soldiers, besides a considerable number
of Arm’d Citizens in _St. Salvador_; besides, in the Forts about the
City on the Walls lay twenty three Brass, and twenty six Iron Guns.

[Illustration: Urba SALVADOR]

This Victory was scarce obtain’d, when Colonel _Dorth_, who had lost the
Fleet at _Point Vincent_, arriv’d here after all was done, and caus’d
Edicts to be publish’d, in which the fled Citizens were promis’d greater
Priviledges under the _Netherlanders_ Protection, than ever they had
under the King of _Spain_. Whereupon a few _Portuguese_ return’d to the
City; but the greatest part of them, and those the most considerable,
were partly kept back by Command of the Bishop _Teixera_, who laid the
fault concerning the loss of the City on the Governor _Furtado_, and
partly because they judg’d the _Netherlanders_ unable to defend them
against the _Spanish_ Power.

About the same time several rich laden Vessels arriv’d there from
_Lisbon_, _Janeiro_, _Spirito Santo_, _Angola_ and other Places, all
ignorant of the Conquest of _St. Salvador_.

[Sidenote: Col. _Dorth_ kill’d by an Ambuscade.]

Whilest _Dorth_ and _Willekens_ were ordering all things within the
City, the outstaying _Portuguese_ at last taking courage, Storm’d the
City from Midnight till the next day in the Afternoon, but fearing they
should be set upon behind unawares, Retreated; after which _Dorth_
thinking he had been free from all fear of Enemies, and with a small
Guard riding out of the City to take a view of the adjacent Countrey,
was scarce got a Bowe-shot from the Walls, when a great Body of
_Brasilians_ rush’d forth unexpectedly from an Ambuscade, and wounded
him so mortally, that he fell dead from his Horse, and had his Head
suddenly chopt off, and his Body mangled very terribly.

_Allart Schouten_ being chosen Governor in _Dorth_’s stead, took no care
to fortifie the City; and after his Decease his Brother _William
Schouten_ succeeding him, regarded it less, so that all things went to
ruine, every one striving onely to enrich themselves. Amongst other
Booties, they took the rich laden Vessel which _Francisco de Sarmiento_,
Governor of _Chili_, brought to _St. Salvador_, with fifty eight
thousand _Guilders_, and a much greater sum of Gold and Pearls, all
which was imbezled away.

[Sidenote: Description of _St. Salvador_.]

This City _St. Salvador_, built by _Thomas de Sosa_ along the Sea-side,
runs up broad at the Suburb _Carmo_, hath four Market-places, into the
biggest whereof, being of a long square, run nine Streets, the chief of
which being very broad, hath many stately Houses. The second
Market-place is of like form, onely it winds a little towards the Right,
and at the Entrance stands a strong Prison. The Cloyster _St. Francis_,
inhabited by _Jesuits_, stands in a Park near the Wall by which the Moat
runs. Towards the Sea-side they have a second Structure, much statelier
than the _Franciscan_ Cloyster. Near the Prison stands the Armory, and
somewhat farther the great Church, which _Anno 1624._ was not quite
finish’d. The Church dedicated to the Virgin _Mary_ appears with a high
Spire near the Gate _Bento_, without which the great Cloyster _Bento_ is
built; but the chief Church is _St. Salvador_. On the utmost Point
towards the South-West of the City lies the Fort _Antonio_, between
which and the City stands a very neat Pleasure-house, belonging to the
Bishop. Besides _Antonio_ there are four other considerable Forts,
_viz._ _Diego_, _St. Maria_, _De Gracia_, and _Vittoria_. About half way
between _Vittoria_ and the Cloyster _Bento_, stands the Castle with four
Bulwarks; but on the North-side the City is guarded by the Forts _St.
Peter_, _Philippo_, and _Tapecipe_.

[Sidenote: A great Fleet set out by the King of _Spain_ for the recovery
           of _St. Salvador_.]

The _Spanish_ King seeming exceedingly concern’d at the loss of so
eminent a Place, fitted out a great Fleet for the recovery of what had
been taken from him; but the _Netherland West-India_ Company having
notice of it, put themselves into a posture of Defence, and in a short
time made ready eighteen Men of War and seven Ketches, Mann’d with a
thousand six hundred and ninety Seamen, and a thousand three hundred and
fifty Land-Soldiers, _John Dirkszoon Lam_ being Admiral: But news coming
day after day of the extraordinary Preparations in _Spain_, it was
judg’d convenient to strengthen the Fleet with fourteen Ships and two
Ketches more, carrying a thousand four hundred and thirty Seamen, and
five hundred eighty Soldiers, under the Command of General _Boudewyn
Henrickszoon_, and Admiral _Andries Veron_. Moreover, the _West-India_
Company fitted out a third Fleet, consisting of four Frigats and three
Ketches, Commanded by _Henry Kat_, with Orders to Cruise along the
_Spanish_ Coast.

In the beginning of the Year 1625. _Frederick de Toledo_ weighed Anchor
from _Cales_ with one and thirty Gallions, four Pinnaces, three Tartans,
and a Carvel, all carrying seventy five hundred Men. The Soldiers were
divided into three Regiments, Commanded by the Colonels _Pedro Osorio_,
_Juan Orellana_, and the Marquess _De Torreclusa_.

[Sidenote: _St. Salvador_ re-taken by the _Spaniards_ from the
           _Hollanders_.]

Near _St. Jago_ at the _African_ Cape _Verde_, _Toledo_ joyn’d with the
_Portuguese_ Fleet, consisting of twenty one Gallions and fourteen
Carvels and Barques, Mann’d with four thousand Seamen, two Regiments of
Soldiers, Commanded by _Antonio Nunnez Barreio_, and _Francisco de
Almeida_; but the chief Commander of this Fleet was _Emanuel Meneses_.
Which great Fleet being arriv’d at _St. Salvador_, _Toledo_ himself
Landed at the Fort _Antonio_, leaving the Command of the Fleet to _Juan
Fajardo_: The first thing he did, was to set upon the Cloyster _Bento_;
which having gain’d, he left Serjeant _Troppani_ with two Regiments in
the same, whilest he went and Storm’d the _Carmelites_ Minster, and at
last took it; but in the mean time four hundred _Hollanders_ Sallying
out, made a furious Onset upon the two Regiments, who had possession of
the Cloyster _Bento_, where the _Spaniards_ sustain’d considerable
damage; for besides the wounding of three Captains, and the loss of a
great number of Soldiers, there were slain the Commanders _Emanuel
Aquitara_, _Alonso de Gana_, _Pedro San Stevan_, _Diego Espinosa_, and
Colonel _Pedro Osorio_; But _Toledo_ no whit dismay’d hereat, but taking
fresh courage, brought twenty nine Demi-Culverins ashore, which fir’d so
vehemently out of the _Carmelites_ and _Bento_’s Cloysters, on the
seventeen _Dutch_ Ships that lay near the Shore, that several of them
were sunk, and others shatter’d beyond hopes of ever being repair’d.
After this the _Spanish_ Army was divided into three several Parties,
which continually fir’d on the City from three new rais’d Works; the
chiefest Party, which was in the _Carmelites_ Minster, had twenty three
Brass Guns; the second, plac’d on the great Wall of the Cloyster
_Bento_, fir’d Night and Day with eight Demy-Cannons on the City, in
which all things were in a confusion, whilest the Governor _William
Schouten_ went unconcern’d from one Tavern to another railing at the
Soldiers, who thereupon mutinying and deposing him, chose Serjeant _Hans
Ernst Kyf_ in his room, who, as he was calling a Council of War,
receiv’d a Summons from _Toledo_ to deliver up the City; at which _Kyf_
being much surpris’d, sent a Drummer with a Letter to _Toledo_, desiring
him to grant the Besieged three Weeks time to repair and make fit their
batter’d Vessels to carry them back for _Holland_; and also that they
might, according to Martial Custom, march out with lighted Matches,
flying Colours, Bullets in their Mouths, and with Bag and Baggage. To
which _Toledo_ return’d Answer, That he was now in his own Countrey, and
had gotten possession of four Fortifications about _St. Salvador_, on
which he had planted thirty seven Cannons, and therefore saw no such
necessity to grant the Besieged (who could not possibly expect any fresh
Supplies) such advantageous and bold Demands; and onely promis’d them
their Lives should be at his discretion. Yet at last _William Stoop_,
_Hugh Antoniszoon_, and _Francis du Chesne_ being sent to the
_Carmelites_ Cloyster, agreed with _Toledo_ on these Conditions: _That
the_ Hollanders _should surrender_ St. Salvador _in the Condition it was
then in, march out unarm’d, but with Baggage, and have a free Passage
with Provisions and all things necessary allow’d them for their
Transportation for_ Holland. Whereupon on the first of _May_ the City
was deliver’d up to the _Spaniards_ in such disorder, that some of them
had taken possession of the Gate _Bento_, before those on the other side
of the City knew of any Agreement that was made between _Toledo_ and
Colonel _Kyf_. And thus the Place which had a whole year been under the
Jurisdiction of the _Netherlanders_, fell again under the possession of
the _Spanish_ Crown, onely through the indiscreet management of the
Commanders; for otherwise it was sufficiently strong, and well stor’d
with Ammunition and Men, being able to make out two thousand. Moreover,
the Ketch _De Haes_, was set out before from the _Holland_ Fleet, and
brought news of the Forces that were sent from the _Netherland_ Havens
to their assistance: But the Ships under Admiral _Lam_, as also those
under _Boudewyn Henriczoon_, were stay’d a considerable time in their
Harbors by contrary Winds, and at last reaching the _Line_ were
becalm’d, and through the excessive heat of the Climate many Men lost by
raging and mortal Distempers, insomuch that they reach’d not the Bay
_Todos los Sanctos_ before the twenty sixth of _May_, on which they saw
the _Spanish_ Flag streaming from the Walls of _St. Salvador_, and fifty
great Ships riding at an Anchor near the Shore.

[Sidenote: The City _Porto Rico_ surpriz’d by _Henrickszoon_.]

[Sidenote: Capt. _Uzeel_ slain.]

The _Netherland_ Fleet, divided into four Squadrons, consisted of thirty
four Sail, amongst which _Lam_ carry’d the Flag on the Main-top, the
Vice-Admiral _Adrian Cheszoon_ on the Fore-top, the Rere-Admiral
_Andries Veron_ on the Main-mast, and the Commander of the fourth
Squadron on the Mizne-top: All of them seeing the _Spaniards_ absolute
Masters, judg’d it most convenient to put to Sea; but standing a pretty
while to the South, they found that the strong Current drove them to the
Shelves on the West-side of the Inlet; wherefore Tacking about, they
made towards the Enemy, who at first seem’d to meet them with twenty
eight great Ships, but returning towards the City, the _Hollanders_ also
stood to Sea again, Steering Southerly, though without making much
advantage in their Way, the Sea going very hollow, and the strong
Current setting them towards the Shore, by which means they were in no
small danger before the River _Francisco_, where many of the Men dy’d
for want of fresh Provisions, and the number of the Sick increas’d
daily, insomuch that some of the Ships were like to perish for want of
Men to guide them: It was also judg’d dangerous to lie longer with such
a great Fleet near a Lea-Shore, therefore they put into the Inlet
_Trayciaon_, which lies a League to the Northward of the River
_Monguapigape_, from whence a ridge of Rocks extends to _Trayciaon_, and
being overflow’d at High-water, hath three Openings or Entrances, two
for great Ships, and one, the most Northern, for small Vessels to pass
through: The Sea also breaking against this Cliff never molests the
Ships whatever Winds blow. The Countrey is overgrown with Brambles, and
hath a Lake two Leagues long, and a quarter broad, on the opposite Shore
of which stood a Village, inhabited by _Portugueses_ and _Brasilians_;
but the _Portugueses_ flying from thence left the _Brasilians_ in
absolute possession: The _Hollanders_ going thither found thirty Chests
of Sugar in one Hut; after which the Admiral _Lam_ caus’d his sick Men
to be brought ashore, whilest the Captains _Boshuisen_, _Swart_, _Dyke_,
_Stapels_, and _Uzeel_, march’d up into the Countrey, where they got
plenty of Oranges and Cattel. In the mean time the Ketch _Vosken_,
Mann’d with thirty six Seamen, Cruising along the Sea-Coast of
_Brasile_, took three Ships, one out of the Inlet _Todos los Sanctos_,
laden with Sugar and Tobacco, another with the same Merchandise from
_Pernambuco_, and the third laden with Wines from _Madera_. On the first
of _August_ the Fleet set Sail again, to the great sorrow of the
_Brasilians_, who out of hopes of being protected by them against the
_Portuguese_, had joyn’d their Forces with theirs; but now being
forsaken, they expected nothing but utter Ruine; which to escape, many
of them desir’d to be admitted to go along with the Fleet, which had
been granted them, had not the _Hollanders_ wanted Provisions for
themselves. The Fleet getting off at Sea, the Admiral _Veron_ ran with
twelve Sail to the Coast of _Africa_; and _Boudewyn Henrickszoon_ kept
eighteen Ships under his Command, the rest returning home with Admiral
_Lam_: and thus the Fleet left the unfortunate Haven _Trayciaon_, where
above seven hundred _Dutch_ Seamen were bury’d. _Boudewyn Henrickszoon_
refreshing at _Cape St. Vincent_, steer’d Westerly, when a Storm (which
in twenty four hours blew from all Points of the Compass) surprising
him, broke his Main-mast, separated the whole Fleet, and sunk the
_Flushing_ Frigat; at last getting beyond the Isle _Virgin Gorda_, the
Fleet meeting again, got to _Juan de Porto Rico_ about the latter end of
_September_; into whose Haven _Henrickszoon_ Sail’d with great courage,
notwithstanding the narrow Mouth thereof was guarded by a strong Fort
full of Brass Guns, which fir’d very fiercely upon him, who on the other
side was not idle in discharging his Guns on the Fort; and had not the
shallow Water before the City prevented his Landing that day, he had
gotten a far greater Booty than afterwards he met with; for the
Inhabitants had, during the Low-water, remov’d all their best Goods: but
the next Morning before Sun-rising, the Admiral Landed with eight
hundred Men, march’d into the City without any resistance, pitch’d the
_States_ Flag on the Governor’s House, guarded all Avenues, unhoop’d all
the Wine-Casks which he found there, for fear his Men should make
themselves Drunk therewith, and so neglect their Duty, fir’d from the
Land-side towards the Castle with three Brass Guns, gain’d the Redoubt,
built for the security of the Bridge, which unites the small Isle on
which _Porto Rico_ is built with the great, rais’d a Platform, from
whence he fir’d Day and Night with six Cannons, guarded by Captain
_Thyene_, whilest the Commander _Uzeel_ kept Watch near the Fort; but
his Men being most of them sick, he could not do any great Exploits,
especially since the _Spaniards_ Sallying out, as they did daily, kill’d
many of the _Hollanders_, and amongst them Captain _Uzeel_, after he had
shot down two Turrets from the Castle, which damage the Enemy repair’d
by taking several of the _Hollanders_ Boats; by which means they could
not prevent fresh Supplies from going to the Castle; the Besiegers in
the mean time beginning daily to be in greater want for Ammunition and
Provisions: whereupon _Henrickszoon_ judg’d it convenient to sound a
Retreat, after he had set the Ships belonging to the City _Porto Rico_
on fire in four places. In which Retreat he receiv’d so many farewel
Shots from the Fort, that they were forc’d to go to the Leeward to stop
their Leaks, and leave one of their Ships to the Enemy, in lieu whereof
the _West-Capel_ Frigat took a Barque with four Brass Guns, in the
little Haven _Sierra Gorda_; from whence the Fleet ran into the Western
Bay of the Island _Porto Rico_, where whilest they repair’d and took in
fresh Provisions, _Henrickszoon_ sent the Ships _Hester_ and _Jonas_
richly laden for _Holland_; the remaining part of the Fleet meeting with
strong contrary Tydes at _Porto Rico_, were necessitated to put into the
Inlet _Francisco_, where they made several Marches up into the Countrey,
to the loss of many of their Men, which were kill’d by the _Spaniards_,
lying in Ambuscade amongst the Brambles that grew along by the Ways.

[Sidenote: The Fort of _Margarita_ taken by _Henrickszoon_.]

[Sidenote: _Henrickszoon_ dying, is succeeded by _Adrian Cheszoon_.]

In the middle of _January_, Anno 1626. _Henrickszoon_ Sailing about the
North of _Porto Rico_, steer’d to _Dominico_, and from thence along the
Isles _Martinigo_, _Luzia_, and the Promontory _De tres Puntas_, towards
the Island _Margarita_, where Landing, and Storming the Castle on the
Land-side with fifteen Men, he gain’d the first Breastworks; but the
_Spaniards_ stopping up the Way along which they were to return, they
had without doubt been all slain, had not the Captains _Stapel_ and
_Estienne_ come to their assistance; for the _Spaniards_ seeing them
climbing up the Bulwarks, betook them to their Heels, after they had
kill’d nine of the fore-mention’d fifteen, amongst whom were the
Captains _Urk_ and _Molkman_: of those that leap’d over into the Ditch
most part escap’d; those few that were taken inform’d the _Hollanders_,
That the Way towards the Village, inhabited by _Spaniards_, was every
where stopt up with Barricado’s, through which none were able to pass.
_Henrickszoon_ thus become Master of the Fort, sent the Booty which he
had gotten there, together with three Brass, and five Iron Guns, aboard
of his Ship, blew up the Fort, burnt all the Houses, and ran into the
Haven _Muchina_, to which he gave the Denomination of _Port Maurice_;
where, besides a great number of dry’d Fish, he took forty Tun of Salt
out of one Salt-pit. After this he taking in fresh Provisions at _St.
Fe_, discover’d _Aves_, a low Isle full of high Trees, took above two
hundred Sheep, and abundance of red Wood on _Bonaire_, and before the
Coast a _Spanish_ Frigat richly laden, made Inspections into the Havens
of _Hispaniola_ and _Jamaica_; from whence he fell back on the Coast of
_Porto Rico_, about the Island _Mona_, where discovering four _Spanish_
Ships, he took three of them, and burnt the fourth; he also got
abundance of Tortoises and Crocodiles on the great _Caiman_, and took a
new Ship between the little sandy Isles _Caios_, as also before _Cuba_ a
Barque, which inform’d him, That the Fleet from the _Honduras_, as also
that from _New Spain_, was daily expected at _Havana_: Thence Sailing
into the Haven _Cabannas_, he took a new Vessel of a hundred Tun, and
abundance of Timber and Carpenters Tools on the Shore; he Landed also
with seven hundred Men on the East-side of the Haven, from whence he
march’d along a narrow Path a League up into the Countrey, where he
found a running Stream, Pastures full of Cattel, and a Village, the
Inhabitants whereof being warn’d by the Barking of their Dogs, fled, and
left all manner of fresh Provisions to the _Hollanders_, viz. above two
thousand Oranges, abundance of Lemmons, _Bananas_, Hogs, Calves, and
Bacon; all which having sent aboard, they burnt the Village: After this
they took a _Spanish_ Barque before _Havana_, as also a Ship laden with
Timber, another Barque with Poultry, _Cochenile_, Money, and
Haberdashery Ware, one Vessel with live Tortoises, and another, full of
Salt, dry’d Fish, and some Merchandise. While the Fleet was thus
Cruising up and down before _Havana_, the Admiral _Henrickszoon_ dy’d; a
Man of most approv’d Valor, and of great Conduct: After which _Adrian
Cheszoon_ carry’d the Flag; but the Men mutinying about the dividing of
the Provisions, which began to grow very scarce, all things fell into
great disorder; the Seamen rebell’d against their Commanders, saying,
_That they had been out long enough, and that they would not stay
waiting any longer for the Fleet from_ New Spain _or_ Honduras:
Wherefore steering Home, they all arriv’d safe at the _Texel_ and other
places in _Holland_.

In our foregoing Relation we have given you an Account of the Fleet
which came to assist the City of _St. Salvador_, divided into two
Squadrons; eighteen Sail _Boudewyn Henrickszoon_ kept under his Command,
and twelve Sail remain’d in the Admiral _Veron_’s Squadron, who Sail’d
to the Inlet _Serre Leona_, where he found the Admiral _John Dirkszoon
Lam_ with three Ships, which had lay’n there above two Moneths, by
reason of the Sickness amongst the Seamen.

[Sidenote: A strange kind of Baboon.]

_Frambore_, King of this Place, granted _Lam_ and _Veron_ free liberty
to Hunt, and to gather as many Oranges and Lemmons as they pleas’d, with
which the Seamen were so refresh’d, that they set Sail again, and
amongst many other things carry’d a Baboon with them from _Sierra
Leona_, which so exactly resembled a Man, that it was wonderful to
behold, having a Body, Hands, Eyes, Ears, Feet, and Actions like a Man,
smoak’d Tobacco amongst the Seamen, made a noise like a Child when
beaten. The Inhabitants of _Sierra Leona_, where these Monsters run in
great Companies through the Woods, believe that the Souls of the
Deceased reside in them.

_John de Laet_, in his annual Journal of the Transactions of the
_West-India_ Company, affirms, That he saw a Female of these monstrous
Creatures, which usually had her monethly Flowers.

[Sidenote: The _Hollanders_ ill success before the Castle _Del Mine_.]

The Fleet, as is before mention’d, Sailing from _Sierra Leona_, came to
an Anchor at _Commany_, and Landed twelve hundred Men at _Poquena_,
besides a hundred and fifty _Negro_’s; which Regiment _Andries Veron_
and _Arend Jacobszoon_ carry’d to the Castle _Del Mine_, whither they
before sent a Company, Commanded by _Hans Gryf_, to prevent the Sallies
of the Enemy. The _Hollanders_ tir’d and thirsty, Encamp’d themselves
near the Fort, and whilest some of the Men were seeking for Water,
others smoaking Tobacco, and lying without their Arms and in disorder on
the Ground, and the Commanders were taking a view of the Fort from a
neighboring Hill, two hundred _Negro_’s fell upon the scatter’d Army
with great rage and fury, and so much the greater, in regard the
_Portuguese_ had promis’d them great sums of Money for every _Hollander_
they kill’d: never any Army was in such a distraction, they being
dispers’d and kill’d like so many Sheep, the Admiral _Veron_ and all the
Officers slain, and in a short time four hundred and forty Men cut off;
and had not Captain _Arend Jacobszoon_ been in League with the
Inhabitants of _Commany_, whither the routed Regiments fled, not one Man
had escap’d that bloody Slaughter: Nor was it to much purpose to Besiege
the Castle _Del Mine_, because the Bullets hitting against the Walls of
the Castle, built all of Rock-stones, did no Execution. But the four
Ships inform’d of this miserable destruction, fell down to _Commany_, to
fetch those that were left alive, and return’d home with the other
eleven.

During the unfortunate Expedition of this Fleet, the _West-India
Company_ fitted out nine great Ships and five Ketches in the beginning
of the Year 1626. under the Command of _Peter Peterszoon Hein_, to
Cruise for the _Spanish_ Ships that were expected from _New Spain_ and
_Honduras_.

The _Fox_ Frigat being sent before to inform _Henrickszoon_ of _Heyn_’s
coming, reach’d about the latter end of _May_ beyond the Isles
_Dominico_, _Guadalupa_, _Mevis_, _St. Christophers_, and by _Santa
Crux_; there not finding a Harbor on the South-side, because of the
Rocks, she Sail’d from _Mona_ over to the Main Coast, where seven
Leagues Westward of _Carakess_, he discover’d a high broken Land, whose
Mountains seem’d to reach to the Clouds; from thence she steer’d to the
Promontory _Caldera_, the Isles _Margareta_ and _Coche_, on which last
he took abundance of Goats, not without the loss of forty six Men,
kill’d by the _Spaniards_ and _Indians_.

Mean while the Admiral _Peter Heyn_, in the beginning of _June_, Sail’d
to the Southward of _Barbados_, an Island pretty mountainous, as hath
been formerly mention’d, and full of Woods, and by _Martinino_, whose
Hills are very high and overgrown with Trees. Here _Peter Heyn_ could
get nothing else but sweet Water, and a Fruit resembling a green Grape,
which grew on a round Leav’d Tree, whose Juice cur’d the Scurvey.
Sailing from hence, and Landing on _Guadalupa_, he found a _Canoo_ seven
Fathom long and one broad, and cut out of one Tree. The Inhabitants, a
well timber’d People, went stark naked, and desir’d to be excus’d, that
they could not furnish the _Hollanders_ with more Provisions, because
the _French_ and _English_, Inhabitants of _St. Christophers_, had
pillag’d them.

[Sidenote: Success of the _Dutch_ against the _Portuguese_ Fleet.]

Near _Mona_ the _Fox_ Frigat joyn’d with the Fleet, with information,
that he could hear no tydings of _Henrickszoon_; wherefore _Peter Heyn_
judg’d it convenient to Sail along the South-Coast of _Hispaniola_ with
a separated Fleet, which was to joyn again near the great _Caiman_. Near
_Cape de Corientes_ the _Dutch_ took a _Spanish_ Ship laden with
_Sarsaparilla_; after that another with Salt and Fish, and on the
Shelves before _Coche_ before the Promontory _Antonio_, a Fly-boat with
Tallow and Hides, and at the same places two Vessels more with Ballast,
the Men whereof inform’d him, that the Fleet from _New Spain_ had about
a Moneth before weigh’d Anchor from the Haven _Juan de Ulva_, and set
Sail to _Havana_, so that without doubt they were arrived there;
wherefore _Peter Heyn_ steer’d towards _Tortugos_, in hopes, if he
could, to overtake some of the heavy Sailers. Before the Promontory _De
Florida_ he discover’d seven Sail, and coming up nearer, above thirty,
which, had _Henrickszoon_ been united with _Peter Heyn_, had without
doubt fallen into the hands of the _Netherlanders_; but it being judg’d
a madness to set upon so great a Fleet with so small a number of Ships,
they Sail’d away undisturb’d. _Peter Heyn_ steer’d his Course along
_Florida_, where he met three _Canoos_ with strange Men in them, who
came aboard of him, their Bodies being naked, were painted with several
colours, onely Mats of Rushes about their Middle, and on their Backs
long Tassels hanging down: their Merchandise consisted of a sort of Gum
of little value. The _Netherlanders_ in this Place took also a Vessel
with _Sina_ Leaves, and some pounds of Ambergreece: but the Scurvey
increasing daily amongst them, they Tack’d about, and ran to an Anchor
at _Sierra Leona_, where they stay’d till the latter end of _January
1627._ and then set Sail to _Brasile_, and overtook a Vessel from
_Madera_ laden with a hundred and fifty Pipes of Wine, and other rich
Goods, and ran into the Inlet _Todos los Sanctos_ with undaunted
courage, not regarding the Guns that were fir’d from the Fort and
Battlements of the City _St. Salvador_, near which lay thirty Sail of
Ships, to which he making up, steer’d between the _Portuguese_ Admiral
and Rere-Admiral, whom sinking, he forc’d the Admiral to surrender,
whilest the _Hollandia_ and _Gelria_ Frigats fell upon the rest, which
were forsaken by the Seamen, who leap’d over-board; then several Mann’d
Boats of the _Hollanders_ (notwithstanding the Enemy’s continual firing)
went and fetch’d off twenty two Sail of the _Portuguese_ Vessels; all
which they did in three hours time, onely with the loss of fifty Men,
besides some that were wounded, amongst whom was the Admiral, being shot
with a Bullet through the Arm, and wounded in the Legs with a Splinter;
his Ship also was, with the _Gelria_ Frigat, driven with the Spring-Tide
on a Bank, whence, after the _Gelria_ had receiv’d above sixty Shot from
the Enemy, they both got off at last; but the Admiral’s Frigat being
shot in a manner to a Wreck, was set on fire, which Misfortune ended not
there, for the _Orange-tree_ Frigat blew up, with sixty Men, fourteen
whereof, though miserably scorch’d, had their Lives sav’d. Soon after
which the Admiral sent into _Holland_ the Ship _St. Peter_, the _Hoop_,
_Nostra Sennora de la Vittoria_, and the _Black-Lyon_, which besides
their Lading of Hides, Silver, Gold, and Precious Stones, were most of
them full of Sugar; which safely arriving, did not a little encourage
the _West-India_ Company. After this _Heyn_ took two Ships with Slaves
from _Angola_, which because the Governor of _St. Salvador_ would not
redeem, were put ashore on _Taperica_. On the last of _March_ he set
Sail from the Inlet _Todos los Sanctos_, pass’d by _Morro Pablo_, and on
_Easter_ Eve with a strong Gale by the _Abrolhos_: before the Highland
between _Cape Frio_ and the River _De Jenero_, he discover’d two Sail,
one whereof being laden with Sugar was taken, but the other escap’d in
the Night; then Sailing on to the meandring Stream _Spirito Sancto_, he
digg’d Pits on some of the River-Isles to get fresh Water, because it
was not safe to Land on the Continent on each side, because the
Inhabitants shot frequent showers of Arrows from the Thickets, in which
they lay ambuscaded. Moreover the Town _Spirito Sancto_ sent off several
Fire-ships at the time of Flood, but they being easily quench’d did no
harm. Here also a Vessel laden at _Lisbon_ with Wines and Piece-Goods,
was taken by _Heyn_, who setting Sail again divided the Fleet into three
Squadrons, the Vice-Admiral _Cornelis Oole_ keeping three Ships to
Cruise withal before the River _La Plata_, _Henrick Best_ had one
Frigat, a Ketch, and a Carvel, to guard the Mouth of the Stream
_Jenero_, whilest the Admiral himself Sail’d with four Frigats, three
Ketches, and a Barque, towards the Inlet _Todos los Sanctos_, where two
Ships riding near the Shore by the Fort _Tapecipe_, were by him set on
fire. Also taking a Barque he was inform’d, that six laden Vessels lay
in the River _Tapecipe_, whither he sending some Boats to explore the
truth, they found a great Ship without Men in the Mouth of the Stream,
and half a League farther six _Portuguese_ Vessels lying near the Shore;
bringing back news thereof to the Admiral, he went aboard of the _Fox_
Ketch the next Morning, and taking two Ketches and several Boats with
him, Sail’d up the River, and perceiv’d that the fore-mention’d six
Ships were gotten up higher, and were Mann’d with a hundred and fifty
Soldiers, Commanded by Captain _Padilha_; the _Portuguese_ Admiral lying
in Ambuscade, no sooner perceiv’d the _Netherlanders_ Boats, but he let
flie a whole Volley of small Shot at them, insomuch that it made them
Retreat, and their whole Design had been fruitless, had not _Heyn_
animated his Men to board the Vice-Admiral; which encouragement prov’d
so successful that they master’d the same, killing all those that fell
into their hands; which so amaz’d the two Vessels that lay by, that all
the Men swam ashore, and left their rich Lading to the disposal of the
_Hollanders_, besides which the vanquish’d Party lost above a hundred
and fifty Men, and the Conquerors but fifteen. Somewhat farther up lay
three Ships more, but the River being dry there at Low-water, and so
narrow that the Trees on each Shore could touch one another, _Heyn_
judg’d it convenient to prosecute the Design no farther, but to return
with the three fore-mention’d Prizes, which he did not without great
difficulty; for the _Portuguese_ had rais’d Battlements on each side of
the Mouth of the River _Tapecipe_, and stopt the same with a sunk
Vessel, which _Heyn_ himself set on fire at Low-water, and return’d
untouch’d through thick Volleys of Shot, which flew about his Ears to
the Fleet, leaving the three Ships to be fetcht off afterwards; to which
end he commanded that they should hang some of the taken Hides about the
_Fox_ Ketch’s Pinnace, the Carvel and Boats, that so the Men which were
in them might stand secure from the small Shot, and the rather, because
the Ships could not be got out of the shallow and narrow River but by
Toeing. Mean while the Governor of _St. Salvador_ lay with a
considerable number of Citizens and Soldiers behind the fore-mention’d
Battlements, not doubting but to take revenge for the Losses sustain’d
by _Heyn_; who nevertheless coming down thither Toed out the three
Prize-ships with Boats hung about with Hides, firing into the Enemies
Battlements with his great Guns, which he had put aboard of the _Fox_
Ketch. About the middle of _June_ he took in the Prize-goods in view of
the City _St. Salvador_, where seven _Netherland_ Ships from several
places lay at an Anchor. Setting Sail from hence on the fourteenth of
_July_, and reaching _Noronho_, known by a Mountain which appears like a
Steeple, he met with _Cornelis Oole_’s Fleet, (who had been Cruising
before _La Plata_) with whom he arriv’d safe in the _Texel_, having in
their Way thither from _Noronho_ taken a Prize, laden with Sugar,
Tobacco, and _Brasile_ Wood.

[Sidenote: _Thomas Sickes_ his Expedition.]

[Sidenote: _Henrick Lucifer_ set out by the _West-India_ Company.]

During _Peter Heyn_’s Expedition _Thomas Sickes_, fitted out by the
_West-India_ Company, weighed Anchor out of the _Texel_ with two Sail,
and coming to _St. Vincent_ he found a _Spanish_ Vessel burnt down to
the Hulk, took a _Portuguese_ Pink with Slaves from _Angola_: Near the
Inlet _Todos los Sanctos_ he sunk a Barque, having first taken several
Pots of Oyl and Packs of Linnen out of the same: Before _Pernambuco_ he
took a Carvel with a hundred and eighty Pipes of Wine, and a Vessel with
Sugar and Hides, and drove another ashore against the Promontory _St.
Augustine_. But _Sickes_ being supply’d and strengthned by three Ships
from the _Texel_, and four taken Vessels, ran with four to _Todos los
Sanctos_, sent two to Cruise about _Cape St. Augustine_, and two more to
the North of _Pernambuco_; At the Isle _Noronho_ they were order’d to
stay a Moneth one for another, from whence, after much hardship, they
return’d home with so many rich Prizes, that they pay’d their Charges
ten times double; which so encourag’d the Adventurers, that the Chamber
of the _West-India_ Company in _Zealand_ fitted out three Sail under the
Command of _Henrick Lucifer_, who weighing Anchor from _Flushing_ Anno
1627. steer’d along the Coast of _Africa_ to the _Amazone_ River, and
from thence North North-West to the Stream _Wiapoco_, to settle a Colony
there; to which purpose Rowing up the River with Sloops, they came in
the Night to two empty Houses, built at a place call’d _Wacogenive_,
which they judg’d fit for their purpose; wherefore they carry’d all
things ashore which they had brought out of _Zealand_ with them for the
new Planters, who while they were all busie building of Huts, a _Negro_
was taken Prisoner, who being ask’d why the Inhabitants fled? reply’d,
That it was occasion’d from a guilty Conscience; for two years before a
Barque and two Sloops with _Christians_ coming thither from the
_Amazone_ River, had stay’d thirty days on _Wacogenive_, when unawares
they were set upon by the Natives, and all kill’d except three, who were
yet living. Upon which _Lucifer_, having four _Indians_, three Men and
one Woman, aboard of his Vessel, threatned to put them all to the Sword,
unless they would produce the three foremention’d _Christians_:
Whereupon the next day a _German_ came to the Water side, of whom they
could get little Information, he having in a manner forgot his native
Tongue; but at length the other two coming thither, the eldest of them,
nam’d _John Hendricszoon_, related to him, That the _Portuguese_ in
great numbers fell upon the Plantations near the _Amazone_ River,
Govern’d by Captain _Oudaen_, who after he had fought valiantly a whole
day, being overpower’d by number, retreated to his Barque, and Sail’d
into the Creek inhabited by the _English_, whither the _Portuguese_
following in _Canoos_, cut off not onely _Oudaen_, but the _English_
also, forty six Men onely escaping in a Barque under the Command of
Lieutenant _Peter de Bruine_ to the River _Wiapoco_; where they had
stay’d about three days, when Sergeant _Matruit_ treacherously shot
Lieutenant _Bruine_: after which the forty six divided themselves into
four Parties; but the Inhabitants to rid themselves of these Strangers,
under the shew of great friendship, made them Drunk with the Liquor
call’d _Pernau_, and then murder’d them all, except himself and two
_Germans_. Which villanous act _Lucifer_ judg’d worthy of punishment;
but his Orders being to shew Kindness and Civility to the Inhabitants,
he suffer’d the Murder to go unpunish’d, but built a triangular Fort
near the River _Wiapoco_, on a Hill eight Fathom above the Shore, to
prevent the passing by of Sloops; which done, he went to visit the
Island _Blanco_, where he caught three hundred Goats. From thence he
went to the Bay of _Honda_, the Inhabitants whereof are a valiant
People, tall of Stature, having long Beards, and wearing Copper Rings
through their Ears. Near the Sea-side is a Salt-pan, of which the
Inhabitants make great benefit. _Lucifer_ setting Sail again from hence,
met with three Ketches sent out by the _West-India_ Company at
_Amsterdam_, before _Corientes_. The Commander _Dirk Simonszoon van
Uitgeest_, steering his Course towards the Promontory _St. Anton_, took
a Frigat laden with Meal, Silk, and other rich Goods, and within view of
_Cuba_ near the River _Poros_, descrying two brave Gallions from
_Honduras_, bore up to them with his three Ketches; one of which, call’d
_The Lyon_, being got betwixt both the Gallions, was in no small danger,
the _Netherlanders_ not being able to get up out of their little Vessel
into the high Gallions, in which the _Spaniards_ stood pushing them down
with their Pikes; but no sooner did the _Netherlanders_ throw their
Hand-Granado’s amongst them, but _Uitgeest_ got aboard of the Gallion,
and carry’d her off, whilest the other by nimble Sailing got away. With
this Prize _Uitgeest_ thinking himself sufficiently enrich’d, steer’d
homewards.

_Joost Johnson_ and _Claes Henrickszoon_, Commanding each of them a
Ketch, took a Ship coming from _Lisbon_ before _Pernambuco_, laden with
Meal, Salt, Wine, and thirty Monks; and not long after a Pink with six
hundred _Negro_’s, a Barque with Salt and Iron, a Ketch with Wine, and a
Frigat with _Brasile_ Wood, Sugar and Tobacco: Before _Itamerica_ they
took two Prizes more; with all which they return’d to the _Texel_.

[Sidenote: _Peter Adrianszoon_’s Expedition.]

The _West-India_ Company thus enrich’d by the Spoil taken from their
Enemies, fitted out twelve Ships again under the Command of _Peter
Adrianszoon Ita_, which set Sail in the beginning of the Year 1628. and
anchor’d first before _Blanca_, an Isle abounding with Goats, the Ground
stonie, and in some places Rocky, and having a small, but very
convenient Haven, from whence _Ita_ ran beyond _Porto Rico_, where he
took a Vessel with seven thousand weight of Ginger, and Landed opposite
to _Hispaniola_ on the stonie Isle _Catalina_, where he took in fresh
Water, and then Cruis’d to and again before _Cuba_, took six Barques,
the Prisoners whereof inform’d him, That the _Honduras_ Traders were on
their Way coming thither, and that they had two small Men of War for
their Convoy: Not long after _Ita_ discover’d them Sailing along the
Shore towards the Haven of _Havana_, but before they could get in,
Captain _John Peters_, whose Ketch carry’d two Brass, and fourteen Iron
Guns, boarded the Vice-Admiral, but having no Graplings to take hold
with, the _Spanish_ Ship ran aground, as likewise _John Peterszoon_ in
the pursuit of him; which the Admiral seeing, came to assist his
Vice-Admiral, and ran aground on one side of _John Peters_, which drove
the _Netherlanders_ Ketch in great danger, she not being able to do
Execution with her small Guns, whilest the _Spaniards_ with their
Demy-Cannon play’d vehemently upon her; neither was _Ita_, by reason of
calmness and contrary Tide, able to come up with them, but was forc’d to
stand Northerly, that so he might get an Easterly Wind, which about Noon
always blows fresh here, and so by degrees got near the _Spanish_ Fleet,
till at last coming up with the Vice-Admiral, call’d _St. Jago_, he
threw Fire-pots into her, and presently after boarding her, enter’d with
that Valor, that of three hundred _Spaniards_ above a hundred and fifty
were slain; for those that leapt over-board were kill’d in the Water,
whilest _Joachim Guyszoon_, _John Braems_, and _Anthony Gonde_ fell upon
the Admiral _Sennora de los Remedios_, and took her. In both these Ships
_Ita_ took Two thousand five hundred Chests of Indigo, above Six
thousand Hides, Two thousand five hundred Packs of _Sarsaparilla_,
several Pots of Balsam Oyl, Seventy thousand Pound of Ginger, One and
twenty Bars of Silver, Twelve Brass, and Twenty eight Iron Guns; all
which having taken out, he set fire in both the Ships.

A little before this Victory, the _Fortune_ Frigat weighed Anchor from
_Flushing_, with sixty three Men of War, to be Landed on the Island
_Tabago_. At _St. Vincent_ they found two Men that were left of seven,
who having setled along the River _Wiapow_, under Captain _John Van
Ryen_, were forc’d by the salvage Natives to remove, two whereof dyed by
the way, the remaining five landing on the Isle _Trinidad_, had three of
their Companions kill’d by the _Indians of Granada_, they being
_French-men_, to whom the Natives bore an inveterate Hatred, so that
they left onely the two _Hollanders_ alive. The _Fortune_ assisted by
the _South-star_ Ketch, took a rich Barque near the _Isles des
Virgines_.

[Sidenote: _Vitgeest_’s Exploits.]

Not long after the _West-India_ Company set out twelve Ships more, under
the Command of _Derick Simonszon Uitgeest_, (who had the year before
brought home the two fore-mention’d great Prizes,) who setting Sayl and
getting into the large Bay of the Rocky Island _Vincent_, catch’d
several Goats and Tortels. Before the Coast of _Brasile_ he took two
rich _Carvels_, one from _Pernambuco_, and another from the Inlet _Todos
los Sanctos_; which Prizes having sent home with three Ketches, he
sayl’d towards _Sierra Leona_, known by high and thick Woods, which grow
on a high Coast; from whence returning again to _Pernambuco_, he took
six rich laden Vessels, amongst which was one Gallioon from _Goa_, with
a great Treasure of Diamonds.

[Sidenote: _Peter Hein_’s Expedition.]

[Sidenote: He gives chace to the _Spanish_ Plate-Fleet, & takes several
           of them.]

These successful Expeditions of the Fleets set out from time to time by
the _West-India_ Company, enabled and encourag’d them to undertake
Matters of greater consequence, _viz._ They fitted out one and thirty
Sail, which carryed four thousand Men, one hundred and thirty Brass
Guns, and five hundred fifty eight Iron Guns; of which _Peter Peterszoon
Hein_ being Admiral, took near the Soundings of _Tortuga_, two Barques
from _Havana_, the Men whereof inform’d him, that the Plate-Fleet was
not yet arriv’d there, nor that from _Terra Firma_, but were both
expected every day. The strong Current drove _Peter Hein_ farther
Eastward beyond _Havana_ than he expected, insomuch that he got sight of
_Matanca_, where he overtook a Barque sent out by _Landronce de
Cabrera_, Governor of _Havana_, to give notice to the Plate Fleet of the
_Hollanders_ Ships, which he had seen from the Castle _Morro_ before
_Havana_: Mean while _John Van Hoorn_ took a Vessel which was sent out
before by the Plate Fleet, the Men whereof inform’d him that the Fleet
it self was near at hand; which _Peter Hein_ found to be true, when the
next Morning before Sun-rising he descry’d ten Sayl, of which some had
ignorantly sayled to Leeward, and others to Windward of the _Dutch_
Fleet; nine of them which were Laden with Hides, Meal, Campeche-Wood,
Cochinele, Indigo, and other rich Goods, were taken by several Mann’d
Sloops, because the Ships were not able to come up to them by reason of
the Calm. About Noon _Peter Hein_ discovering nine Gallions more, made
sudden Chace after them; which they perceiving, made toward the Shore,
and about Twilight in the Evening they ran aground in the Bay of
_Matanca_, where the Commanders Landing saved themselves, each carrying
with him what Jewels they could. About Break of Day _Peter Hein_ made
all the Sayl he could possible to come up with them, and seeing them
fast aground, leapt into a Boat and Rowed up to the Admiral, who fired
eight Guns, whilest his Men got ashore: _Hein_ approaching the Gallioon,
saw no way to get up, till at last one of his Men spying a Rope, climb’d
up the same, and made fast other Ropes for his Companions to get up by,
the _Spaniards_ standing still gaping upon him, as if their feet and
hands had been ty’d, which made _Peter Hein_ grant them their Lives;
which the other Gallions seeing, surrender’d themselves upon promise of
Quarter; by which the _Spanish_ Crown lost, besides the Musk, Bezoar,
Ambergreece, and the Cargo of two Gallioons and a rich Prize, above One
hundred and fifty Tun of Gold.

The Night succeeding this great Victory being somewhat Tempestuous,
drove the Gallioons from the Bank on which they stuck the Day before,
into deeper Water: Five Days they spent in unlading of the taken
Vessels, after which _Peter Hein_ set Sayl with four Gallioons, a new
_Spanish_ Merchant-Man, and his own Fleet, out of the Bay of _Matanca_,
on the Seventh of September, _Anno 1628._ for _Holland_, where in a
short time he safely arriv’d.

[Sidenote: The Expedition of _Lucas Pol_.]

The _Tyger_ Frigat sent from _Zealand_, and Commanded by _Lucas Pol_,
Anchor’d before _Blanca_, where he brought away above five hundred
Goats: This Island which is six Leagues in circumference, hath on the
West a Sandy Inlet, fit for great Ships to Ride at Anchor; Moreover, it
is deep and Rocky, in the Valleys the Grass grows above half a Mans
length. The Woods are overgrown with Thorns; the Soyl also would produce
much more fruit, did not the Rats, _Leguanes_, Hedge-hogs, and other
Animals, devour and spoil the Plants.

_Pol_ leaving this Island ran to _Tortuga_, a low Isle, except on the
West side; it produces _Guaiacum_, or Pock-wood, in great abundance, and
nourishes great Flocks of Goats, and hath an eminent Salt-Pan; in all
which things it is parallel’d with the Island _Orchilla_, known by its
high Mountains on the East and West; the other part thereof not being
above six Foot above the Water: _Pol_ Landing here, carry’d off above
two hundred Goats near the Western Shore, whose bryny Soil produces
neither Grain, nor Grass. The Trees which are on the same are so dry and
weak, that they may be pusht down with one hand; Neither are there any
Birds to be found here, except Owls; nor Beasts, except Goats and great
Hedge-hogs. _Pol_ sayling from hence, steer’d by the nine Wooddy Isles
call’d _Roccas_, and the three call’d _Aves_, to _Bonaire_, a pretty
large rising Isle, which on the North-West hath a convenient Road, a
fresh Water-spring, store of Sheep, on which the _Spaniards_ live;
Pock-wood, and Cotton Trees: Then steering to the Isle _Mona_, he found
the same to be surrounded with Rocks, and full of Horned Cattel
difficult to be catch’d because of the thick Woods, in which grow
exceeding good Oranges. _Pol_ leaving this Isle, set sayl and steer’d
for _Flushing_, where he safely arriv’d without having perform’d any
remarkable Exploits.

[Sidenote: _Adrian Pater_ his Expedition.]

Mean while the _West-India_ Company fitted out twelve Sayl more, under
the Command of _Adrian Johnzon Pater_, who set sayl in the middle of
_August_, and Cruised in vain about the _Flemmish_ Isles for _Spanish_
Ships: About the beginning of the Year 1629. he sent away three Ships
under the Command of _Martin Landrode_, from the Island of _St.
Vincent_, whilest he himself ran with the rest of the Fleet into the
Inlet _Todos los Sanctos_, within a League from the City _Salvador_,
where there lay onely seven Barques near the Shore, which he judging not
worth the while to hazard his Ships and Men for, steer’d to
_Pernambuco_, took a rich Laden Barque in his Voyage, and was inform’d
by a _Brasilian_ that came aboard of him on floating Pieces of Timber,
that three Sayl of Ships full of Goods were return’d to _Reciffa_, so
soon as they heard of the _Dutch_ Fleet: But _Pater_ judging no good to
be done there, return’d back to the _Caribbee Islands_, where near
_Granada_ he found three _Dutch_ Vessels, which had likewise Cruis’d in
vain before the Coast of _Brasile_. Moreover, the _Pegasus_, _Raven_,
and _Hart_ Frigats, parted from the Fleet to Cruise about _Monges_,
touching at _Blanca_, they took above a thousand Goats, and between the
Cliffs of the little Isles _Monges_, abundance of Fish; but descrying no
_Spanish_ Ships, they Sail’d to the Island _De Vacca_, which hath a
brave Harbor, delightful Woods, pleasant Pastures, fresh-water Brooks,
and abundance of wild Horses, Hogs, and Lyons, of which the Sea-men took
an infinite number. Before the low Promontory _Corientes_, overgrown
with Trees, they got two Prizes laden with _Campeche_ Wood.

These three fore-mention’d Frigats, as also the _Walcheren_ and
_South-star_ from _Zealand_, joyn’d with _Pater_’s Fleet, when he
receiv’d Information, that a considerable number of _Spanish_ Ships were
suddenly expected from _Campeche_: Whereupon _Paters_ divided his Fleet
into three Squadrons, whereof the Forlorn consisted of three Sail, the
Reserve of the like number, and the Admiral kept five under his own
Command: Thus divided, they stood to and again before _Cape Corientes_,
when Captain _John Stapel_ brought three, and _John van Hoorn_ four
_Netherland_ Ships to their assistance.

[Sidenote: _Hoorn_’s Expedition.]

_Hoorn_ having set Sail from the _Texel_ about the latter end of
_April_, was beaten off from _Granada_ with poyson’d Arrows, and took a
Prize before the Promontory _St. Anthony_, the Men whereof inform’d him,
that the Governor _Gabriel de Chaves Osorio_, an old Soldier, had great
trouble in repairing the Walls, Forts and Houses in the City, which two
years before had been blown down by a great Storm, and that six great
Ships were lading to go for _Carthagena_ with the Gallions for _Spain_,
because they durst not Steer by _Porto Rico_ for fear of the
_Netherlanders_; moreover, that abundance of Ginger was spoyl’d for want
of Vessels to carry it away; and that the Citizens were in great want
for Stuffs, none having come in a long time from _Spain_; in like manner
there went none but Copper Coin, so that nothing was to be got there.
The Silver and Gold Mines were not look’d after, the _Spaniards_ not
caring to work, and the old Natives were long since cut off, insomuch
that if the Imperial Court was not kept in _St. Domingo_, to which
belong’d _Cumana_ and _Coro_, that City and Island, and _Hispaniola_ it
self, would soon be left desolate. _Hoorn_ therefore Sail’d by the
Promontory _St. Cruiz_, being a low Point overgrown with Trees, into the
Bay, twenty Leagues from the Mouth whereof lie the Isles _Jardin de la
Reyna_. Before _Corientes_ he took a Barque with three hundred and six
Guns, sent from _Havana_, the Men whereof inform’d him, That the
Governor of _Havana_, call’d _Laurence de Cabrera_, having Intelligence
of the _Dutch_ Fleets approach, rais’d many Men, and gave notice to the
Ships in all the Harbors thereabouts; after which he took another rich
Prize, and joyn’d at last with _Paters_ Fleet, which now consisted of
twenty Sail, with which he Steer’d for the Soundings of _Tortugas_,
where the Fleet met with a dreadful Tempest, wherein a Thunderbolt
splitting the Main-Yard of the _Hunter_ Frigat, fell down by the Mast,
and rowl’d out at one of the Port-holes, kill’d the Purser, and wounded
two more in the Head: great showers of Rain fell daily, when _Samuel
Lucas_ and Captain _Outger Minne_ brought seven Sail of Ships more to
the Fleet, with which _Paters_ put in for fresh Provisions into the
spacious and secure Haven _De Cabannas_, where several Isles lie,
formerly inhabited by Shepherds and Carpenters.

From hence _Paters_ Sail’d by _Havana_, mended the Port-holes of his
lower Deck, and took off the Top-gallant Masts, because in _September_
the usual Storms begin here; and seeing that he could not do any Exploit
with so great a Fleet, he sent nine Ships home, and with the rest went
to _Barbados_, where at that time there were about fifteen hundred
_English_ that Planted Tobacco.

_Paters_ Sailing from hence, ran to the Main Continent of _America_,
inspected the River _Oronoque_, where he quenched the Town _St. Thomas_,
that had been set on fire by the fled Inhabitants, and brought aboard
all what they had left.

[Sidenote: _Henrick Lonque_’s Expedition.]

[Sidenote: Takes _Olinda_.]

During his fruitless Expedition, the _West-India_ Company Rigg’d out
twenty seven Sail under the Command of _Henrick Lonque_, _Peter Ita_,
and _Joost Bankart_; the Land-Soldiers being Commanded by _Diederick Van
Waerdenberg_. _Lonque_ coming to _St. Vincent_, stay’d a long time at
Anchor there; for in regard the _Spaniard_ in the _Low Countreys_ rang’d
on the _Veluwe_, and had taken _Amersfoort_, the _States_ of the _United
Netherlands_ were forc’d to keep those Men in their Service which the
_West-India_ Company had rais’d; but so soon as _Wesel_ was re-taken,
and the _Hartogen-Bosch_ won by _Frederick Henrick_, Prince of _Orange_,
thirty six Sail were sent to _Lonque_’s assistance; of which some came
sooner to him than others at _St. Vincent_, where he had stay’d four
Moneths without doing any remarkable Exploit. On _St. Steven_’s Day he
set Sail with fifty two Ships, thirteen Sloops, and two Prizes, all
Mann’d with seven thousand Men, which meeting with contrary Winds and
Calms, lay a great while under the _Line_, the Scurvey began to encrease
amongst them daily, insomuch that above twelve hundred lay sick, and
three hundred dy’d since they set Sail from _St. Vincent_; yet at last
_Lonque_ getting sight of _Olinda_, sent _Waerdenberg_ on the fourth of
_February_ with sixteen Ships, carrying three thousand Men to _Pavo
Morello_, a Wood, lying two Leagues Northward from _Olinda_, where he
suddenly Landed, notwithstanding the _Portuguese_ guarded the Shore with
two thousand Men, whom _Waerdenberg_, after a short Skirmish, putting to
flight, was the whole Night in Arms, and the next day became Master of
_Olinda_, by breaking in on the North at the same time, when Colonel
_Schutte_ Storm’d on the South. Moreover, the Enemy surrendred the two
Forts on _Reciffa_, and forsook the Island.

About the middle of _March_ nine Ships which were wanting to make up
_Lonque_’s Fleet, came to an Anchor by him, having brought him above six
hundred Soldiers, many Guns, all manner of Ammunition under the Command
of Lieutenant Colonel _Alexander Seton_, and the three Adjutants _John
de Bruine_, _Philip Serooskerken_, and _Horatius Calandryn_, who
immediately order’d the Cloyster on _Antonio Vaes_ to be fortifi’d, and
built a Fort with four Bulwarks at the Entrance of _Pozo_ in the
Countrey _Reciffa_. _Seton_ also set fire on the Suburbs of _Olinda_, in
which the Enemy had Lodg’d the Night before, and endeavor’d to poyson
the fresh Water on _Antonio Vaes_, when on a sudden the _Netherlanders_
fell upon them; two which drank of the Water dy’d, and others fell into
great Fits of Sicknesses, and it wanted little but that the Admiral
_Lonque_, with a Company of fifty Musquetteers, had been kill’d
returning from _Reciffa_ to _Olinda_, he being unawares set upon by two
Companies of _Portugueses_ and _Brasilians_, who kill’d above thirty six
of his Men, and dangerously wounded six more, so that he brought off but
eight Men unhurt. The like Misfortune befell the Wood-cutters on
_Antonio Vaes_, surpris’d by the _Portuguese_ from an Ambuscade.

Whilest Affairs stood thus about _Olinda_, there first arriv’d two Ships
from the _United Netherlands_ at _Reciffa_, not long after four more,
Commanded by _John Walbeek_, and eight more under the Admiral _Dirik Van
Uitgeest_, who was follow’d by the _Noahs Ark_.

About the same time _Dirk de Ruiter_ set Sail with six Ships, and _Peter
Ita_ with ten, to Cruise at Sea.

[Sidenote: _Ita_ being set upon by the Enemy, escapes very narrowly.]

About the beginning of _February_, _Lonque_ having put all things in
good order, prepar’d to return home, and weigh’d Anchor with nine Ships.
But _Ita_ going from _Reciffa_ to _Olinda_, to take his leave of the
Council there, was suddenly surpris’d after a strange manner; he had
ninety Musquetteers for his Guard, whose Matches were all put out, and
their Arms all wet by a great shower of Rain, which they perceiving from
their Ambuscades, immediately got cross the River, and kill’d thirty of
the _Netherlanders_, the rest running away, left _Ita_ to defend
himself, which he did for some time with his Sword, but had absolutely
been slain, had he not receiv’d Aid from _Olinda_.

Because the _Portuguese_ made several Attempts upon the _Netherlanders_,
not without damage on both sides, the _West-India_ Company often sent
Ships to their assistance; and likewise many _Brasilians_ deserting the
_Portuguese_, joyn’d with the _Netherlanders_, who built a five-corner’d
Fort with Bulwarks about the Cloyster on _Antonio Vaes_; which to
prevent, the _Portuguese_ ventur’d many a Sally, though not without
considerable loss on their part. They also reported, that _Frederick de
Toledo_ was making thither with a great Fleet, to drive the
_Netherlanders_ out of _Brasile_; at which they taking the Alarm, put
themselves all into a posture of Defence, rais’d new Works about the
Castle on _Reciffa_, whilest the Ships which Cruis’d on that Coast
brought in several Prizes.

_John Walbeek_ being chosen General by the _West-India_ Company over
_Brasile_, had a Design on the Promontory _St. Augustine_; but it came
to no effect, because the Sea beat so vehemently against the Shore.

[Sidenote: Great Supplies sent to _Brasile_ by the _Netherland
           West-India_ Company.]

The Report of the great preparation of a Fleet which was making ready in
_Spain_, mov’d the _West-India_ Company to raise more Men, and to send
out Admiral _Paters_ with seventeen Ships, which all arriv’d safe,
except the _Black Lyon_ Frigat, which carrying the Lieutenant-Colonel
_Eltz_ and Captain _Uitgeest_, was never heard of.

_Joost Bankart_ was also sent out in _March_ with eight Ships to _St.
Helena_, to Cruise there for the rich _Carraks_ which us’d to Water
there; but though he stay’d till _August_ before this fruitful Island,
yet saw not one Ship at Sea, nor a Man on the Island, but great numbers
of Sea-pies, which are so tame, that they suffer themselves to be taken
up with the Hand, or knock’d on the Head with Sticks.

Near this Isle _Ita_ took a Ketch Prize, and rallying his whole Fleet
together, Steer’d for the _Caimans_; the most Eastern Isle whereof being
about three Leagues long, is full of Rocks, with a high Point on the
East; the other part thereof is plain. Then dividing his Fleet into
seven Squadrons, he made them all ready for an Engagement, when he was
inform’d by an _English_-man before _Corientes_, that _Frederick de
Toledo_ had set Sail with eighty Ships from _Havana_ to _Spain_, of
which he had sent back eight Gallions to _Carthagena_: Hereupon bending
his Course near _Havana_, he put the whole Countrey to an Alarm, burnt a
rich laden Vessel, and another that carry’d a Flag on the Fore-top, and
a third laden with Ballast.

_Joachim Guysen_ being made Commander of the _Dolphin_ Frigat, and sent
to joyn with Admiral _Pater_’s Squadron, was driven below _Jamaica_, and
at last strook against the great _Caiman_, where his Vessel was all
shatter’d to pieces; but all his Men and Goods being sav’d, he spent
sixteen Weeks in making a Ketch of the pieces of the _Dolphin_, and
brought a hundred and twenty Men, four Brass, and two Iron Guns to the
Fleet, having buried the rest on _Caiman_.

Five Leagues beyond _Havana_, a _Spanish_ Ship laden with _Campeche_
Wood and _Sarsaparilla_, being chased against the Shore, was set on fire
by her own Men, which the _Hollanders_ attempted twice in vain to put
out.

After this _Ita_’s Fleet lay long upon the Coast of _Cuba_, but finding
no _Spanish_ Vessels, and their Provisions growing scarce, return’d back
to the _Texel_, where they arriv’d without doing any farther Exploits.

[Sidenote: _St. Martha_ taken by the _Dutch_.]

In the mean while _Pater_ lying before _Punta del Gallo_, intending to
Invade the City built on the Shore of the Island _Trinidad_; but the
Fort built at the Mouth of the River, and contrary Current preventing
his Design, he ran through the middlemost Hole of _Boccas_ to _Blanca_,
where he caught two thousand Goats and a _Bonaire_, set several Towns on
fire, whilest the _Spaniards_ made a Smother of dry Stubble all along
the Fields, through which the _Hollanders_ were to return, that so they
might be choak’d with the Smoak; which their Invention had prov’d
successful, had not the _Hollanders_ forc’d a Way through a Wood. At
last the Fleet leaving _Hispaniola_, Steer’d for _St. Martha_, a Town
built on the Main Coast between _Carthagena_, and the River _La Hacha_,
being instigated thereto by a Letter (taken by the _Hollanders_ in a
Prize) writ by the Governor _Hieronymo de Quero_ to the _Spanish_ King;
which Letter set forth the present Condition of _St. Martha_, whereby
they conceiv’d great hopes of a possibility of taking it, and of the
Advantages that would accrue thereby: nor did it happen contrary to
their expectation; for the Admiral Landing his Men, took the City
without the least resistance; and though the great Fort fir’d some Guns,
yet it soon surrendred on promise of Quarter; the City also was sav’d
from being burn’d, by paying fifty five hundred Pieces of Eight, after
they had plunder’d the same, and carry’d away whatsoe’re they thought
good. Mean while the Provisions growing scarce in the Fleet, _Pater_
judg’d it convenient to return home, where he arriv’d safely with all
his Prizes.

[Sidenote: The valiant Exploit of _John Lichthart_.]

Notable Exploits were perform’d by _John Lichthart_, one of which,
amongst others ought not to be omitted, _viz._ he setting Sail homewards
from _Reciffa_ about the beginning of _October_ _Anno 1630._ chanc’d to
fall with his Ship, the _Over-yzel_, amongst five _Biscayan_ Pyrats,
Cruising between the _French_ and _English_ Coast, which thought to clap
him aboard on a sudden; but they seeing him bear up to them, were afraid
to venture, and Tack’d about: after which he was set upon about three
Leagues to the Northward of the _Lizard_, by three Frigats belonging to
_Dunkirk_, the biggest whereof carry’d thirty six Guns, the second
twenty eight, and the last twelve; with which three he maintain’d a
Fight eight hours, in which he had fourteen Men kill’d, and thirty two
wounded; his Ship resembled a Wreck, the Main-mast being shot overboard,
the Rudder hung by pieces at the Stern, and the Tackling all shatter’d
and torn, besides seven Shot under Water, and not less than four hundred
through the sides above, but not without sufficient marks of retribution
on the _Dunkirkers_ side; but _Lichthart_ getting into _Plymouth_,
mended his Ship, and from thence Sail’d to _Amsterdam_, where he was
Presented with a Gold Chain in recompence of his Valor.

[Sidenote: The Expedition of the _Brown-Fish_ Frigat.]

The Expedition of the _Brown-Fish_ Frigat is also remarkable, which
Sailing beyond _Cape de Verd_, Steer’d by _Cape Roxo_ along the Shore to
the River _Catchieu_, at whose Mouth lie two Shelves, and between them
ran a Channel through which the Ships pass’d. The _Brown-Fish_ Sailing
about a League up the River, which is a Mile in breadth, took a
_Portuguese_ Barque. The Seamen also Landing on the Isle _Bissis_, spake
_Portuguese_ with the Natives, who are Coal-black, and have strong
Bodies, go Arm’d with Darts, Bowes, Arrows, Symiters, and were Baptiz’d
by a Priest sent thither from _Portugal_, who with a few Countrey-men
had built a Chappel and some Houses there.

From hence the _Brown-Fish_ Sail’d to the most Northern Isle _Bisegos_,
which is continually at Wars with _Bissis_. The King of this Isle
receiving some Presents from the _Netherlanders_, gave leave to his
Subjects, shie at first, to go aboard of them.

Steering from hence to _Noronho_, they found the Inhabitants carry’d
away, and their Gardens and Houses ruin’d, so that they could get
nothing but wild Pumpions to refresh themselves with; therefore leaving
the Isle they anchor’d at _Reciffa_.

In the interim, whilest these Expeditions were carry’d on as hath been
related, Captain _John Boon-eter_ (who parted from the Admiral _Ita_’s
Fleet with eight Sail of Ships) Cruis’d to and again before _Hispaniola_
till _May_ Anno 1631. near _Mona_ he took a rich Vessel coming from
_Porto Rico_, another before the Island _Vacca_, and a third full of
Ginger, with which he Steer’d to the _Tortugas_, being seven in number,
resembling rather sandy Flats than Isles. Before _Havana_ he also chased
several Vessels, but lost sight of them in the Night. Mean while their
Provisions growing short, the Seamen were desirous to return; which
_Boon-eter_ would no way yield to, because the time began to approach in
which the _Spanish_ Ships came from all places to _Havana_; but the Men
mutinying forc’d him to Steer to the _Texel_, where they arriv’d without
doing any considerable Exploit advantageous to the _West-India_ Company.

[Sidenote: The Fort of _Tamarica_ assault’d by the _Dutch_ in vain.]

But at the same time fourteen Ships, three Sloops, and seven great
Pinnaces, weighed Anchor from _Reciffa_ with a thousand two hundred and
sixty Men, divided into twelve Companies, under the Command of _Hartman
Godefrid_ and _Stein Callenfels_; who Landing on the Island _Tamarica_,
march’d along a bad and narrow Path, partly craggy and partly sandy, to
a Fort built on a high Ascent overgrown with Brambles in such a manner,
that it was impossible for them to break through, whilest they in the
Fort fir’d continually upon _Stein Callenfels_, who judg’d it convenient
to draw off, and Storm the Castle on another side.

The Admiral _Pater_ newly come from the _Texel_ to _Olinda_, sent three
Ketches, a Sloop, and two Pinnaces, beyond the Town _Tamarica_, to
prevent the Enemies crossing over to the Main, and keep off their
Fire-ships. They also receiv’d Information from three _Portuguese_ and
five _Brasilian_ Prisoners, That the Castle, surrounded with Fens and
Brambles, had sixteen Guns; and that _Albuquerque_ had sent eight
hundred Men to assist the three hundred that lay in Garrison there
before. The Captains _Le Grand_ and _Arcisseusky_ found two other Ways
that led to the Fort, but altogether unfit to march along with their Men
and Guns. _Pater_ also Row’d round the Island with Sloops, and fathom’d
the Water, whilest _Arcisseusky_ Sailing up the River to _Garasi_,
suppos’d that he had found a much better place to make an Onset on the
Castle in, than had been found out yet; but the Council of _Olinda_ and
_Stein Callenfels_ look’d upon it as too great a hazard to Storm a Fort,
to which the Ways lay so much to the Enemy’s advantage, a small number
in the same being able to beat off a considerable Party; therefore it
was judg’d best, and concluded upon, to build a Fort on a little Isle
near _Tamarica_, at the Mouth of the River; to which purpose the
Engineer _Buuren_ contriv’d a square Castle with a long Horn-work, which
was call’d _Orange_; in which the Captains _Arcisseusky_, _Mellingen_,
and _Beyer_, were left in Garrison with their Companies, whilest the
rest of the Regiment return’d to _Reciffa_.

Mean while _Antonio de Oquendo_ brought a great Fleet to _St. Salvador_;
and _Callenfels_ drew four Companies of Musquetteers, and a great
company of Seamen with Pick-axes and Spades out of the Fort _Frederick
Henrick_ into the Field, and marching Southward along private Ways, he
found the River strongly fortifi’d near the Forts _Affogados_, having
above and below a row of strong Pallisado’s; yet the _Portuguese_ that
guarded these Works after a small resistance fled, and left all: But
because a general Alarm drew many People in Arms out of _Real_, and
several other places, _Callenfels_ drew off in good order, and was
inform’d by a Prisoner call’d _Peter Alves_, that the Fort _Affogados_
receiv’d that Denomination from the River on which it was built; that
there lay generally a hundred and fifty Men in Garrison there; that
about a Mile farther was the Fort _Pirange_. that _Peter de Acunha_ bore
the chief Command next to _Albuquerque_ over the _Militia_, who us’d few
Musquets but what had Fire-locks; and that they wanted no Ammunition,
for six great Carvels loaden with the same had not long since stor’d
them with great plenty thereof. The _Netherlanders_ also understanding
by Letters which they had taken, that the _Tapuyans_ were very much
incens’d against the _Portuguese_, who stood in great fear of these
salvage People, it was judg’d convenient by the Council at _Olinda_, to
invite the _Tapuyans_ to be their Friends.

[Sidenote: Fight between the _Dutch_ and _Spanish_ Fleet.]

[Sidenote: Admiral _Pater_ drown’d.]

On the eleventh of _September_ Anno 1631. Admiral _Pater_ and
Vice-Admiral _Martin Thyszoon_, whose joint Forces were fifteen Men of
War and three Ketches, carrying nine Companies of Foot, Commanded by
Captain _Engelbert Schutte_, descrying the _Spanish_ Fleet about an hour
before Sun-set, animated all the Officers and Captains to regard their
Honor and Oath which they had taken; telling them, That on this
Engagement would depend the Welfare or Ruine of the _West-India_
Company. But his Men were not so much heartned by his Speech, as daunted
at the sight of the _Spanish_ Fleet, which consisted of twelve
_Castilian_ and five _Portuguese_ Gallions, and twenty six other
Vessels, as Pinks, Fly-boats and Carvels, all well Mann’d and full of
Guns, the Gallions carrying whole and Demi-Cannons; the Admiral, call’d
_Antonio de Oquendo_, carrying forty eight great Guns in his Gallion,
call’d _St. Jago_; whereas they had receiv’d Information but of four
Gallions and eighteen lesser Vessels; nevertheless _Pater_ no whit
discourag’d, boarded him about ten a Clock the next Morning, whilest
Captain _John Mast_ boarded him on the other side, which occasion’d a
bloody Engagement; and it would have prov’d fatal to the _Spaniard_, had
not _Pater_’s Stern taken fire, which he endeavoring in vain to put out,
and none coming to his assistance, after he had hung a good while by a
Rope at the _Spanish_ Admiral’s Bowe, he was forc’d through faintness to
let go and fall into the Water, whilest his Ship was blown up, a few of
his Men onely being sav’d by _Oquendo_. In the mean time _Martin
Thyszoon_ boarded the Gallion _Antonio de Padua_, Commanded by the
Vice-Admiral _Francisco de Vallezilla_ on one side, and the _Utrecht_
Frigat on the other, which after half an hours Engagement lost her
Main-mast, and after a sharp Fight of four hours the Fire took hold of
her Sails; which the _Netherlanders_ not being able to quench, leap’d
desperately over into the _Spanish_ Vice-Admiral; but he having two
hundred and sixty Men aboard, beat them off, forcing them to leap into
the Water, or sell their Lives at a dear rate. But Captain _Thyszoon_
had better success, for he not onely sunk the Vice-Admiral, but took the
_Bonaventura_ Gallion, and likewise gave the Gallion _John Baptista_ so
many shot under Water, that she sunk likewise. The Night approaching
ended this bloody Engagement; and the _Netherlanders_ Fleet much
damnifi’d stood Northwards, with intention to return to _Reciffa_. The
next Morning _Oquendo_ had lost sight of them, but descry’d them again
on the fifteenth of _September_, and kept in view of them the six
following days, five Leagues from him to the East, or East South-East,
_Martin Thyszoon_ coming to an Anchor before _Reciffa_ on the twenty
second of _September_.

About the same time the _Amsterdam_ Frigat set Sail from thence for _St.
Salvador_, with intention to joyn with _Pater_’s Fleet there, but not
finding the Admiral, return’d, and near _Cape St. Augustine_ discover’d
the _Spanish_ Fleet; wherefore running close behind them she receiv’d
four Guns from _Oquendo_, which she answer’d, and kept at a distance
from them the whole Night, in hopes to meet with one single Vessel or
other belonging to the Fleet; but the _Spanish_ Vice-Admiral bearing
little Sail, guarded the Rere, and fir’d continually at the _Amsterdam_
Frigat, who fearing an unlucky Bullet, made all the Sail she could
possible, and brought news of the approach of the _Spanish_ Fleet to
_Reciffa_. Soon after which the _Elephant_ came from the _Dutch_ Fleet
thither, with a full Account of the fore-mention’d Engagement, _viz._
That besides the Admiral _Pater_, there were slain Captain _Thomas
Sickes_, _Cormillion_, and Lieutenant _Steenbergen_, also that two
Ships, the _Prince William_ and the _Province of Utrecht_, were sunk: In
lieu of which they had taken the Gallion call’d _The Bonaventura_, with
twenty six Brass Guns, weighing above sixty four thousand Pound, two
hundred and forty _Castilians_, and a great parcel of Sugar and Tobacco;
Amongst the Prisoners was one call’d _Francisco de Fuentes_, who being
Examin’d, gave this Information, _viz._ That the Fleet carry’d two
Regiments of _Spaniards_ and one of _Italians_; in which three Regiments
were four thousand Men, under the Command of _Conde del Bangniola_; and
that upon the setting out of _Ferdinand_, the King’s Brother, to the
_Netherlands_, all the chiefest Gallions and _Dunkirk_ Ships were sent
for, and _English_ Vessels hir’d, to convey him safe to the _Flemmish_
Coast, which made _Oquenda_ set Sail with so much the lesser number to
_St. Salvador_; that the sunk Gallion, call’d _Antonio de Padua_, had
fourteen Brass Guns in her Hold, besides twenty six that were mounted.

[Sidenote: Two _Tapuyan_ Kings offer their Service to the _Hollanders_.]

Soon after a _Brasilian_ that had pass’d by _Albuquerque_’s Army to
_Olinda_, brought Information, That he was sent by _Jandui_ and
_Oquenou_, two Kings belonging to the _Tapuyans_, to enquire if the
_Topatingas_ (for so they call’d the _Netherlanders_ that belong’d to
the _West-India_ Company) did yet reside in _Pernambuco_, with Proffers
to assist them with their Forces. Moreover, he inform’d them, That since
his departure from _Boudewyn Henrickszoon_, a great many of the
_Tapuyans Petivares_ were kill’d by the _Portuguese_ near the River
_Grande_ and Inlet _Trajiciaon_, because they had assisted
_Henrickszoon_, who had left them helpless at his departure. He added
also, That if the _West-India_ Company would give the other _Brasilians_
any assurance to assist the _Tapuyans_, it would be necessary to Consult
about it near the River _Grande_.

This Proposal was found to be of so weighty a Concern, that _Ellert
Smient_ being sent with the Ship call’d _The New Netherland_, and a
great Sloop, to _Siara_, to make farther enquiry into the Business, was
accompanied by a Renegado _Portuguese_ call’d _Samuel Cochin_, and
several _Brasilians_ (whom _Henrickszoon_ upon their Request carry’d
with him from the Inlet _Trajiciaon_ to _Holland_) who went, under
pretence of visiting their Relations at the River _Grande_ and _Siara_,
to invite their Countrey-men to joyn with the _Netherlanders_.

[Sidenote: _Olinda_ deserted and demolish’d by the _Hollanders_.]

During _Smient_’s absence many Consultations were held about the
demolishing or defending of the City _Olinda_, about which there had
formerly been many Contests; but at last the Voices carry’d it, which
were for the demolishing thereof, in regard it was of little
Consequence; and could not be kept without many Men and great Charges,
because of its bad Situation, whenas their Men might do greater Service
in other places: Wherefore they began to carry all things necessary from
_Olinda_ to _Reciffa_, and on the twenty fourth of _November_ the City
was set on fire with Barrels of Pitch and Tar, being in a light flame at
every corner, whilest _Stein Callenfels_ drew off the Garrison in good
order to _Reciffa_; and immediately sixteen hundred Men under his
Command were put aboard of sixteen Vessels, with intention to go to
_Parayba_; but the Enemy having a fortnight before had notice of this
Design, had fortifi’d himself all along the River. _Callenfels_
approaching, espy’d twelve _Portuguese_ Standards, and the Men ready on
the Breast-works to prevent his Landing; yet nevertheless he not
regarding their Bullets, press’d in amongst them, and forc’d the Enemy
from his Works.

Near the Water stood a Stone Castle, and on one side of it a large
Store-house; on the Mountain near the City appear’d the _Franciscan_
Cloyster; the Fort rais’d of Earth had four Bulwarks, and twenty six
Guns, according to the Information of the Eye-witnesses _Drevis_ and
_Berster_, who were sent thither as Spies.

[Sidenote: _Callenfels_ attempts to take the City, but without success.]

_Callenfels_ Landed not so carefully but that he lost forty Men, either
kill’d from behind the Breastworks, or out of a neighboring Wood. Being
inform’d by a _Portuguese_ Prisoner, of the ill Condition of the Town,
and how slenderly it was provided, he immediately rais’d a Sconce, two
Watch-houses, and a Pallisado, from which he fir’d with two Guns on the
Castle, and made several Trenches; but the Besieged were stronger in
People and Guns than the Besiegers, who being scarce able, by reason of
their small number, to keep Guards in all places, were also tir’d out
under a hot Climate, and fainted for want of Provisions, insomuch that
in two days there dy’d and fell sick above two hundred; wherefore
_Callenfels_ judg’d it best to draw off in time; which that they might
do securely, they made a Redoubt, and the six Companies Commanded by the
Captains _Redincheven_, _Meppelen_, _Cloppenburg_, _Schenk_, _Byma_, and
_Cook_, resolv’d upon a desperate Attempt, as followeth: Marching
privately through a Wood behind the Enemy’s Works, they fell in at one
side upon the _Portuguese_ Trenches, from whence they drove them after a
small resistance, and forc’d them to flie towards the Fort, whither they
were pursu’d with such eagerness, that those who were in the Fort, lest
the _Hollanders_ might get in with them, lock’d up the Avenues against
their own Men; at which they were so amaz’d, that some of them climb’d
up by the Walls of the Fort, but were either kill’d by the Assailants,
or knock’d on the Head by their own People, because several _Hollanders_
went to climb up amongst the _Portuguese_; the rest running about the
Fort, fell into the midst of the _Netherlanders_, where they were all
cut off, being in number above a hundred. The _Hollanders_ also in this
resolute Design, had about twenty Men kill’d, and fifty wounded; after
which they put lighted Matches on Sticks in their Enemy’s Works, as if
they had never made any Attempt on the City _Parayba_.

Whilest this Expedition fell out so unfortunately, _Smient_ performing
his Voyage, found in the Inlet _Trajiciaon_ a _Portuguese_ Vessel hal’d
near the Shore under the protection of two Pallisado’s; wherefore
supposing it best not to make any Attempt on the same, he ran to an
Anchor before _Ubranduba_, twenty Leagues below the River _Grande_;
where the Natives _Marcial_, _Tacou_, _Ararova_, and _Matauwe_, who had
been in _Holland_, Landing, went to see, and speak with their
Countrey-men to joyn with the _Netherland West-India_ Company: and some
days after the Seamen Landing again in the same place, met with _Tacou_,
together with eight more stout Men, and seventeen Women and Children,
who carry’d a slain _Portuguese_ call’d _Juan Perera_, to the River
_Grande_, about whom they had found Letters containing the whole
Condition of _Siara_; which the _Brasilians_ imparting to _Smient_, he
sent a Ketch thither before, and follow’d after himself; they Steer’d
along the Shore beyond the Shelves _Guamare_, by the Mountains
_Sailinas_ and _Porto de Mel_, the Haven _De Onces_, and River
_Juaguarive_, to the _White Point_, where the _Brasilians_ Landing spake
with their People, and towards the Evening brought good tydings, and
desir’d that they might be Landed at _Siara_, where they would put their
Design in practice: _Smient_ following their Advice, receiv’d them
aboard the _New Netherland_, and Sail’d along by the square Fort _Siara_
towards a smooth Shore on each side, hedg’d in by thick Woods, where the
_Brasilians_ intended to Land; but the _Portuguese_, and _Brasilians_
belonging to their Party, being gotten into the Wood before, fir’d so
vehemently, that they were forc’d to Retreat, and Sail five Leagues
farther beyond the Cape _Opese_, made dangerous by the many blind Cliffs
that lie about the same. _Smient_ anchoring here, Landed the
_Brasilians_, on promise that they would return in two days; but the
Seamen seeing sometimes ten, sometimes fifteen Arm’d _Portugueses_
ashore, judg’d that the _Brasilians_ had been slain by them, and
therefore weighed Anchor to the great dislike of the _West-India_
Company.

Since this unsuccessful Design on _Parayba_, the Council at _Reciffa_
were no whit discourag’d, but resolv’d to make an Attempt on the River
_Grande_ with twelve Ships and two Sloops, carrying ten Companies of
Soldiers, besides Seamen; but by reason of the difficulty of Landing
(because the Coast being very Rocky, makes the Sea go very hollow), the
strength of the Place, both in respect of its Fortification and number
of Defendants, and the joyning of the _Brasilians_ with them, they were
forc’d to return without effecting their Design.

[Sidenote: The Expedition of _Nekker_, _Houte-been_, and others.]

[Sidenote: The Marquess _Salinas_ murther’d for his Jewels.]

About the same time eight Sail arriv’d at _Reciffa_ from _Holland_, and
_Jonathan de Nekker_, _Cornelis Corneliszoon_, alias _Houte-been_, and
_Reinier Peterszoon_, set out with three Frigats from the _Texel_ to the
Isle _Vacca_, where with Hunting, Fishing, and gathering of Fruit, they
refresh’d themselves, and afterwards Steer’d to the River _Magdalena_,
discernable at three Leagues distance by the thick yellow Water it
discharges into the Sea through three Mouths. Between the Western and
middlemost Mouth lies an Isle in the middle of the River, behind which
_Houte-been_ came to an Anchor, whilest _Nekker_ and _Peterszoon_ kept
Guard near _Punto Verde_; where though the Wind blew very fresh in the
Night, yet the Water remain’d smooth: About Day-break _Nekker_
discovering a Sail, made chase after the same, but not able to come up
with her, lost her the following Night, and in the Morning saw a Barque,
which running ashore was set on fire by _Peterszoon_; after which
_Nekker_ chased two other Ships, which likewise getting from him, he
stood off at Sea out of sight of the Isles _Zamba_, which are low on the
West, and Hilly at the East-end, where the Sea beats vehemently against
a Promontory, and chased a Barque ashore, whither he sent a Boat with
eight Men; which being beaten to pieces by the Waves, drowned four of
them, and the rest getting ashore were kill’d by the _Spaniards_. Soon
after which four _Spanish_ Ships set Sail after _Nekker_ and
_Peterszoon_, and had not the Night favor’d them they had been but in a
bad Condition; for they were not able to get their Sea-men aboard, who
having taken some Wine ashore, had made themselves Drunk; about
Day-break they descry’d the four _Spanish_ Vessels, which were gotten so
far from them, that they could but just discern them from the Main-top.
Not long after they took two Barques, and came to an Anchor behind
_Zamba_ by _Houte-been_, who being driven by a Storm out of the River
_Magdalena_ to _Jamaica_, had chased a Barque ashore there, and a Ship
with four hundred _Negro_’s against _St. Martha_, and since took a rich
laden Barque near the River _Magdalena_. In like manner _Nekker_ and
_Peterszoon_ took a Ship coming from _Caraques_, leaving _Houte-been_
alone before _Magdalena_, who not long after discover’d eighteen
_Spanish_ Ships near the High-land _St. Martha_, which were Steering to
_Carthagena_; one whereof belonging to _Carthagena_ he made Prize of,
but was forc’d to forsake her in a great Storm; after the ceasing of
which he took another Frigat, the Men whereof inform’d him, That the
Admiral _Thomas de Caspure_ was going with eleven Ships from _Cape
Antonio_ to _Porto Belo_, to lade the _Peruvian_ Silver there. The Ship
with _Angolan Negro_’s, taken by _Houte-been_, he set free, but kept a
Frigat laden with Tallow, Hides, Tobacco, and Flesh, which he had taken
just before the Coast of _Rio Grande_; and thus he went Privateering up
and down, when the Plate-Fleet from _New Spain_ weighed Anchor from
_Juan de Lua_, the like of which in Riches had never set Sail before,
for it carry’d 2169340 _Ryals_ of _Eight_ for the Merchants, an
unvaluable Treasure for the King, besides many rich Commodities which
several bought upon their own Accounts, that were not entred in the
Custom-house: all which Treasure, laden in nine Gallions, besides a
considerable number of Frigats and small Vessels, was committed to the
Charge of _Miguel de Echacareta_; but he dying before the Fleet set
Sail, _Manuel Serano de Ribera_ was chosen Admiral; but a dreadful Storm
arising as they were Sailing before the Coast of _Campeche_ in their Way
to _Havana_, the whole Fleet was in a manner utterly destroy’d, with a
most unvaluable Treasure: The Admiral, Vice-Admiral, Gallion _Teresia_,
and several other Gallions, sunk, with at least two thousand Men, a
great number of Persons of Quality, and amongst the rest the Marquess
_Salinas_, who was most treacherously slain by thirty Persons, who made
themselves Masters of a Sloop, into which he went for safety out of the
sinking Admiral _Juseppe_: That which instigated them to this horrid
Act, was the sight of a small Trunk of Jewels which he carry’d into the
Sloop: Not long after falling out amongst themselves about dividing the
Spoil, several of them were discover’d, apprehended, and put to death.

This Fleet weighed Anchor the day after their Admiral _Miguel de
Echacareta_ was buried, who dy’d so suddenly that he could make no Will.
A few days after the departure of the Fleet, a hundred and seventy
Houses were burnt at _Juan de Lua_. It appears that the _Spaniards_ out
of fear of the _Netherlanders_, set Sail on the tenth of _October_,
notwithstanding it was at an inconvenient time, because about that
Season the Hurricanes rage most terribly in the Bay of _Vera Crux_.

By a Letter from the Treasurer _Franciscus Suarez_ it appears, that the
two Regiments in the City _St. Salvador_, the one Commanded by
_Christopher Mexia Bocanegra_, consisting of nine Companies, each of
sixty Men, and the other Commanded by _Vasco de Mascarennas_, consisting
of thirteen Companies, cost the King of _Spain_ yearly 21515 _l._ to
maintain them.

[Sidenote: _Walbeck_’s Exploits.]

The _Netherland_ Council at _Reciffa_ no way discourag’d by their
successless Attempts made the last Year on _Rio Grande_, sent thirteen
Companies of Soldiers aboard of seventeen Vessels, to build a Fort at
the River _Formosa_, where the _Portuguese_ being too weak to resist
them, set fire on a Store-house with three hundred Chests of Sugar, and
fled: _Walbeck_ was Commander in Chief in this Design, who Landing on
_Formosa_ found no fit place to build a Fort in, because the Shore, not
being above a Musquet-shot broad, was inclos’d with Woods, behind which
lay high Mountains that Commanded the Shore; therefore marching to
_Serinhain_ he burnt several Houses and a new Sugar-Mill, near which in
a Store-house he took twelve hundred Chests of Sugar, which for want of
Carts he could not carry to his Ships. Also before _Porto Calvo_ he
burnt a Carvel, and took a great number of Cattel on _Camarigibi_, and
return’d without any farther Exploits to _Reciffa_, where the Cruisers
had brought in several Prizes during his absence.

The Council resolving not to sit idle, set out another Fleet of eighteen
Ships under the Command of _Martin Thyszoon_, with a Regiment of
fourteen Companies under _Stein Callenfels_.

[Sidenote: The Expedition of _Martin Thyszoon_ and _Stein Callenfels_.]

This Fleet approaching _Cape Augustin_, they found a ridge of Rocks
along the Shore, against which the Sea beat with great vehemency; at
length they came before a small Inlet, at whose Mouth lay a small Fort
from which the Enemy fir’d upon the Mann’d Boats which Row’d by the
same: at some distance they discern’d two Breastworks, one rais’d above
the other near the Shore; on which when the _Hollanders_ thought to
Land, three hundred _Portugueses_ fir’d at once upon them; and on a Hill
not far from thence appear’d more Men, which amaz’d the Council of War,
for the Inlet was so narrow, that not above six Boats could Land at
once; and it was evident, that though the Enemy should chance to be
beaten from behind his Breastworks, yet the _Hollanders_ would lie
expos’d to the Enemy’s Guns from the Fort _Nazareth_ built on the
Mountain; besides, _Nazareth_, if gain’d, could scarce be defended,
unless the whole Mountain were Intrench’d round, which would not onely
be very chargeable, but also impossible, because of the red Earth,
altogether unfit for Fortifications; and the barren Mountain afforded
neither Wood, nor any thing else; besides, the Storming of it would be
very dangerous: The Entrance into the Haven was difficult, because a
stonie Bank before the same suffer’d no Passage but betwixt small
Openings; the chiefest whereof was guarded by a WaterCastle, and farther
within by the Fort _Puntael_. Along the Sea-shore their Landing was
prevented by the violent beating of the Waves, and a great square Tower
on the Way up to the Fort _Nazareth_, whose Church is seen at a great
distance off at Sea. All which consider’d, they judg’d it best to draw
off their Men again, and so they return’d without having effected any
thing to the purpose, onely Captain _Schuppe_ took two Carvels with five
hundred Chests of Sugar in the River _Formosa_.

[Sidenote: The City of _Garasu_ surprised by the _Hollanders_.]

Soon after _Martin Thyszoon_ being sent out with twenty two Sail, sent
four Ships for _Holland_ with the Lieutenant-Colonel _Stein Callenfels_,
and the Councellor _Serooskerken_; yet thirteen Sail remain’d still
before the Coast of _Brasile_, under the Command of Captain _John Mast_,
who whilest he stood to and again from the Shore, and Cruising up and
down, the Governor of _Reciffa_ and Colonel _Rembach_ march’d with five
hundred Men and forty _Negro_’s, from _Reciffa_ about six a Clock at
Night, by _Olinda_ along the Shore: Whereupon the _Portuguese_
Horse-watch ran instantly to _Real_, two Leagues from _Olinda_, to give
notice thereof to _Albuquerque_; but they surmounted all the
Difficulties they met with by the Way (which were the greater in regard
of the abundance of Rain that had lately fall’n,) and on the first of
_May_ 1632, came to the City _Garasu_ about Noon; where whilest
_Rembach_ stood still in good order with three Companies, the Governor
of _Reciffa_ fell upon the Town with three Companies. The Inhabitants
had not the least thoughts of being molested by the _Netherlanders_
there, because they judg’d the Ways which led thither could not be
pass’d in that rainy Season. In the first Onset a hundred _Portugueses_,
most of them great Merchants, were slain, they being come thither with
their Goods from _Olinda_; and amongst the Prisoners which they took,
were six _Franciscans_.

This Victory the _Hollanders_ obtain’d with the loss but of eight Men,
and twenty five wounded, besides Captain _Rembach_, who was also
wounded. The Governor of _Reciffa_ entering the City, stav’d two hundred
Pipes of Wine, to keep his Soldiers from over-drinking; and because
there were many fair Women there, he caus’d them all to be lock’d up in
the Church of _St. Cosmo_, to preserve them from the Soldiers outrages.

[Sidenote: Description of _Garasu_.]

The Priest _Duarte Mendez Serraon_ (a Letter of whose _John de Laet_
quotes) values the Booty carry’d away by the _Hollanders_ from _Garasu_,
at 9000 l. _Sterl._ besides the damage which the Place suffer’d, being
almost ruin’d. He relates farther, That the City call’d _Villa de Santo
Cosmo de Garasu_ lay five Leagues to the Northward from _Olinda_; and
that in it were three Churches, _viz._ _Cosmus_, _Misericordia_, and
_Heremitage de Santa Crux_; as also two Cloysters, _viz._ _Invocation de
Antonio_, inhabited by _Capuchins_, and another dedicated to
_Franciscus_, inhabited by Persons of his Order; That the chief Church
_Cosmus_, built like a flat-roof’d House, had a fair Entrance, before
which stood two Turrets, and in them hung Bells; That the _Franciscan_
Cloyster was inclos’d within a great Wall in the middle of a pleasant
Garden, and had on each side a Tower; That most of the People who kept
the Feast of _St. Philip_ and _St. Jacob_, were at _Mass_ when the
_Hollanders_ came thither, and though they saw the Soldiers out of their
Windows, judg’d them to be _Portugueses_, who (as it was reported) had a
Design upon _Tamarica_.

The Governor of _Reciffa_ marching with his Booty from _Garusa_, set
several Houses on fire, and march’d towards the Fort _Orange_, on the
Island _Tamarica_. _Albuquerque_ inform’d thereof, dispatch’d a
_Spanish_ Regiment, Commanded by Colonel _Ferdinand Ludovico Barbalho_,
and _Paulo de Perado_, with a considerable Body of Volunteers; but they
all came too late: Whereupon the _Portugueses_, being thus kept in
continual Alarms ashore, and sustaining every day more and more Losses
at Sea, began to desire Peace, and the rather, because they could not
hear of any Fleet coming from _Spain_ to their assistance; and hearing a
Report, that the _West-India_ Company were making great Preparations. To
which purpose _Peter Alvares_ (acquainted with the _Dutch_ Commanders,
as having been their Prisoner) was sent by _Duarte de Albuquerque_ (to
whom the Lordship of _Pernambuco_ properly belong’d) and by his Brother
(being General of all the Forces in _Brasile_) to _Reciffa_, to Treat
about the deciding of the Differences between them and the _Netherland
West-India_ Company: But the Council in _Reciffa_ weighing the many
Disadvantages that would ensue, if they should upon easie Terms patch up
a Peace with the _Portugueses_, return’d _Alvares_ this Answer: “That
the _West-India_ Company was resolv’d, to the utmost of their power, to
keep all those Places which they had taken by force of Arms; but that if
he could move _Albuquerque_ to deliver up the Countrey to them, he
should be bountifully rewarded.”

After this the _Hollanders_ Landing at _Barra Grande_, took great
quantities of Wine and Tobacco, and burnt two Villages; as also the
Sugar-Cane Fields, and Sugar-Mills on _Catuwanha_, also one at _Barra
Grande_, and three at _Porto Francisco_.

At the same time the _Hollanders_ also scatter’d Letters amongst the
_Portuguese_, signifying their trouble for the great effusion of Blood
in those Parts, which was occasion’d by their own stubborn and
unreasonable Proceedings; likewise intimating the great Preparations
that were making on their own part, and on the other side the great
unlikelihood, and indeed impossibility, as things then stood, of
receiving farther Succors from _Spain_.

[Sidenote: The _Hollanders_ Counsels betray’d to the _Portuguese_ by
           _Leonard van Lom_.]

These things being powerfully urg’d, had perhaps taken greater effect
with the _Portugueses_, had not the secret Counsels of the
_Netherlanders_ been betray’d by _Leonard van Lom_, Overseer of the
Prizes, and Translater of the _Portuguese_ Letters, who confess’d that
he was perswaded to that villanous Action in _Amsterdam_ by a
_Portuguese_ Merchant, call’d _Duarte Rodrigues Delves_, with whom he
had made some Agreement; and for the better confirmation had receiv’d
the _Sacrament_ upon it of an _Amsterdam_ Priest: His Agreement was,
“That he should go to _Reciffa_, enquire after all Concerns, and give
speedy advice thereof to _Rocque de Barros_; which he did by a
_Mulatto_, who carry’d Letters between them.”

This Villain the Council judging worthy of Death, first caus’d his two
fore-Fingers to be cut off, next his Head, and afterwards his Body to be
divided into four Quarters. The _Mulatto_ was likewise Beheaded.

About this time the Treasurer _Ceulen_ viewing the Isle _Mayo_, found
the same to be surrounded with steep Rocks, abounding with Horses,
Asses, Partridges and Goats, besides two Salt-pans. The Inhabitants,
which go Arm’d with Half-pikes and rusty Hangers, are said to be a sort
of out-law’d _Portugueses_, to the number of thirty, amongst whom was
one Woman. They had a Governor, call’d _Amaro_, to whom they gave yearly
eight thousand Goat-skins.

_Ceulen_ Sailing from hence Steer’d by the Island _Del Fogo_, known by a
great Mountain, whose high top vomits Fire. Not far from which he took
the Ship _St. Peter_ laden with Wine, with which he return’d safe to
_Reciffa_, where a while after _Gysselling_ arriv’d also, and was no
sooner Landed, but four Ships, two Sloops, six Cock-boats, a Barque and
a Hoy, set Sail under the Conduct of _John Mast_ with four or five
Companies of choice Musquetteers, Commanded by Colonel _Schuppe_, who
Landed behind the stonie Bank of the River _Alexio_, surpris’d some
_Portuguese_ and _Negro_’s in their Houses, and march’d in the Night so
fast, that by Day-break they were got to the Shore of the River
_Formosa_, where they took two rich laden Fly-boats and a Carvel; and
afterwards Landing in the Road _Camarigibi_, they took fifty
_Portuguese_ in a Village, as also a Store-house full of Chests with
Sugar and Tobacco, burnt all the Buildings thereabouts, and amongst
others a brave Sugar-Mill: Captain _Byma_ burnt also an eminent
Sugar-Mill near the Brook _Maria Farinha_. _Martin Thyszoon_ lay a long
time under the _Line_; but at last getting to the Isle _Vacca_ he gave
each Captain his Orders, and divided the Fleet, which joyn’d again
before _Havana_, pass’d through the Straights _Bahama_ (where he met
with great Storms, and many other Inconveniences) to _Holland_. But
_Galeyn van Stapels_, who parted with a Frigat from _Thyszoons_ Fleet
near _Bonaire_, Steer’d by the Promontory _Cotoche_ to _Sisal_; which
Village having plunder’d, he set it on fire, fetch’d a Barque in the
Night from the Road of _Campeche_ (whose City is seen at a great
distance off at Sea, by the white Cloyster _Francisco_) and so set Sail
for _Zealand_. _Houte-been_ arriv’d also about the middle of _June_ with
a rich Booty in the _Texel_.

[Sidenote: _Schuppe_ and _Lichthart_ take the Fort _Formosa_.]

Not long after _Houte-been_ weighing Anchor with the _Otter_ Frigat,
return’d to _Reciffa_, and in his Way thither took a Ship laden with
Wine. Colonel _Schuppe_ immediately upon his arrival had a Command given
him of five hundred Men, and _John Lichthart_ of three Sail of Ships, a
Pinnace and five Sloops; with which they set Sail to the River
_Formosa_. _Schuppe_ Landing his Men there, march’d up to the Fort
_Formosa_, fortifi’d with Moats, steep high Walls, and four Guns,
Storm’d and took the same, killing all those that were in the Garrison,
except the Governor _Peter Albuquerque_: In which Victory nevertheless
the _Hollanders_ lost the valiant Captain _Philbert du Basson_, who
being shot in at the Throat with a Bullet, which came out behind the
Ear, dy’d of the same, the Wound immediately festering, to which all
Wounds are very subject in _Brasile_. The _Hollanders_ also burnt four
laden Barques, a Store-house full of Sugar, and pull’d down the Fort
they had taken.

Setting Sail again, they Landed to the Northward of the River _Antonio
Grande_, where they gain’d a Platform with five Guns, destroy’d six
Ships, and took two more in the Haven _Camarigibi_; from whence they
return’d to _Reciffa_, after having spoil’d and taken thirteen of the
_Portuguese_ Ships, several Sugar-Mills, Store-houses, and a Castle.

The _Swol_ Frigat came also in a shatter’d condition to _Reciffa_,
having been Engag’d with a _Spanish_ Gallion carrying twenty eight great
Guns, and full of Men, which nevertheless she would have master’d, had
not an unfortunate Shot spoil’d all her Rigging.

About the same time the Captains _Byma_, _Everwyn_, and _Rinking_, set
Sail with their Companies in three Ships to _Porto Francisco_, where
Landing, they burnt three Sugar-Mills, besides several other brave
Buildings, and brought away a rich Carvel, whilest _Laurence van
Rembach_ was made Colonel in _Waerdenberg_’s place, and _Sigismond
Schuppe_ Lieutenant-Colonel.

The Proffers which the _Tapuyan_ Agent made to the _Hollanders_ had been
very advantageous, had not the Summer Season been too far spent: for he
had promis’d, That if they would Land a considerable Party of Men two
Leagues Southward from the River _Grande_, all the _Tapuyans_ should
joyn with them, and assist them in driving the _Portuguese_ out of
_Brasile_.

After this _Schuppe_ and _Lichthart_ went with thirteen Companies of
Soldiers, and two hundred Seamen, to fall upon the Enemy’s Camp at the
_Afogados_, where _Albuquerque_ had rais’d several Works, partly for the
securing of _Verga_, the best Spot of Land in all _Pernambuco_, where
there are likewise more Sugar-Mills than in the whole Countrey, and
partly to keep an open Way between _Arryal_ and the Promontory _St.
Augustine_: To which purpose they march’d by the Fort _Æmilia_ along the
plain Countrey, to the Stream _Capivaribi_, which they had cross’d
before the _Portuguese_ knew any thing of their approach, who being but
a hundred and thirty, forsook their Works and ran into the Woods; but
assisted with four Companies of _Italians_, they Sally’d out of _Real_
and fell with great eagerness on the Seamen, who being guarded by forty
Musquetteers were raising of Works in the Road which leads to _Real_,
and put them to flight; but being rally’d, and seconded by Colonel
_Redburgh_, they drove the Enemy into a By-way, guarded by _Byma_ and
_Bongarson_; where being stopt, and Captain _Cloppenburgh_ from another
side falling in amongst them with his Musquetteers, they became
encompass’d, and had been all slain, had not _Le Grande_, by making way
for _Cloppenburgh_, given them an opportunity of getting away between
them.

The Council at _Reciffa_, to secure the footing which they had got on
the other side of the River _Capavaribi_, took order about the building
of a Fort, which requir’d the greater Labor, because the Earth was very
stonie: not far from whence Captain _John Smith_ walking, was shot by a
Party of _Portuguese_ lying behind some Chests of Sugar; the Blow
whereof giving notice to his Ensign, he speedily march’d thither, and
surprising the _Portuguese_, kill’d most part of them. The like success
had _Le Grande_, _Cloppenburgh_, and _Bongarson_, who marching out upon
a Design, surpris’d unawares in _John de Mendoza_’s Sugar-Mill, two
Companies of _Portuguese_, who having watch’d there the whole Night, and
composing themselves in the Morning to sleep, were set upon, and most of
them kill’d, and the old Commander _Antonio Ortizo de Mendoza_ taken,
who not long before came thither with a Regiment of _Portugueses_; the
Sugar-Mill was also set on fire.

These successful Expeditions still adding to the _Hollanders_ fresh
Courage, they follow’d the career of their Successes, and placing three
Companies in the Works of the _Afogados_, drew their Army into three
Divisions; Colonel _Rembach_ was to Command the Forlorn; _Schuppe_, the
main Body; and _Byma_, the Reserve; in which Order they waded through
the River _Capivaribi_, placing some Musquetteers in a House built near
the High-way, to secure their Return that way, and came without any
resistance to the _Arryal_; where they found a long Street, with Shops
on each side full of all sorts of Goods, which they pillag’d,
notwithstanding the Enemy fir’d furiously from the Castle upon them, and
wounded Colonel _Rembach_ and Captain _Redburgh_. To the Northward
before the Castle lay a Redoubt with two Guns, which _Schuppe_
mastering, kill’d all that were in the same; but being too weak to carry
away the Guns, he nail’d up the Touch-holes, and march’d off with his
Men, but in such disorder, that the _Portuguese_ Sallying out of their
Garrison, fell in amongst them in that manner, that they were not able
to bring away their wounded Men, amongst whom was Captain _Redburgh_;
and it had been worse, had not _Rembach_ (who though he was shot in at
the Shoulder, under the Blade-bone whereof lay the Bullet) kept them off
till such time as the _Hollanders_ were got over the River _Capivaribi_,
near the fore-mention’d House, guarded by a Company of Musquetteers, who
kill’d above fifty of the _Portugueses_, besides fifty that had been
slain in the former Skirmishes; the _Hollanders_ themselves also had
lost a hundred and thirty Men: yet notwithstanding they ceased not, but
march’d in Parties through all parts of _Verga_, where they met with no
opposition, but found the Sugar-Mills full of Sugar, left to be kept by
a few _Negro_’s. _Rembach_ also sent a Drummer to _Real_, to demand the
Wounded, especially Colonel _Redburgh_, with a Letter from the Prisoner
_Antonio Mendoza_, requesting the Governor _Albuquerque_ and Duke of
_Bagnola_, that they would be pleas’d to release the _Hollanders_ on
Exchange, or else upon Ransom. The Drummer being civilly Entertain’d by
_Albuquerque_, brought back with him a strange Oyl call’d _Aury_, for
the wounded _Mendoza_; with which a Wound made by a Bullet being
anointed about three fingers breadth, it draws out the same. _Bagnola_
afterwards sent it to _Rembach_, in requital for his kindness in sending
_Mendoza_ in a Hammock to _Real_. Mean while the _Hollanders_ still
fortifi’d their Works at the _Afogados_ with Pallisado’s and Platforms,
on which they put five Guns. They likewise work’d daily on the
fore-mention’d Castle, whilest _Schuppe_ march’d with four hundred Men
in the Night over the River _Jangada_ to _Moribeca_; which approaching,
he perceiv’d the Way stopt up with fell’d Trees; wherefore he march’d
about to the Village, which he found forsaken by the Inhabitants, and
all the Houses left empty, onely five hundred Chests of Sugar that had
been brought thither from _Verga_ which _Schuppe_ Commanded to be set on
fire with the Village, leaving onely the Church, and at his Return burnt
also a Sugar-Mill.

[Sidenote: Articles between the _West-India_ Company and the King of
           _Spain_.]

The Governor _Albuquerque_ having formerly never spar’d any _Hollanders_
which fell into his hands, began now to be better advis’d; and it was
also Agreed upon between the King of _Spain_ and _States_ of the _United
Netherlands_, That they should burn no Church, unless the one, or the
other Party made resistance in the same; That the Victor should be
oblig’d, upon request of Quarter, to spare his Enemies, and release the
Prisoners for an indifferent sum of Money; That both Parties should
forbear to use chew’d or poyson’d Bullets.

_Schuppe_ being chosen Chief over the _Militia_ in _Rembach_’s Place
(who dy’d of his Wound,) lay not long still, but setting Sail with
eleven Ships to the Isle _Tamarica_, Landed seven Companies before the
Castle _Nostra Sennora de Conception_; which, though well provided and
fortifi’d, the Governor _Pignioro_ surrendred, on Condition that he
might depart with all his Men and the Church Ornaments.

_Matthias Van Ceulen_ and _Schuppe_ Rowing up the Stream _Goiana_ with
Sloops and Boats, put to flight _Laurence Cavalcanti_, burnt divers
Sugar-Mills, and took abundance of rich Merchandize: Ten days they made
havock in the middle of their Enemies Countreys without any resistance;
for all of them fled to the _Aldas_, (so they call the _Brasilian_
Villages): At last they return’d home with great Booty, especially of
Sugar and _Brasile_ Wood; whilest those at _Reciffa_ were not idle,
doing the _Portuguese_ great mischief by their continual Sallies,
_Tourlong_ burning a Fishers Village, and _Bongarson_ a stately
Banquetting-house belonging to _Cavalcant_ near _Arryal_; as also _Pedro
Acunha de Andada_’s Sugar-Mill, from whence he took great Booty.

[Sidenote: The _Portuguese_ begin to fall off to the _Hollanders_.]

[Sidenote: _Jacob Huigen_ slain.]

About the same time the _Portuguese_ of several Parts, terrifi’d by
continual Alarms and Losses, began to incline to the _West-India_
Company, believing that they should utterly be ruin’d, if they continu’d
to joyn with _Albuquerque_’s Party (who claim’d _Pernambuco_ wholly to
himself) and therefore car’d not whether he or the _Hollanders_ were
Masters, so they might live peaceably. Mean while the _Hollanders_
march’d from the _Afogados_ to _Arryal_: _Schuppe_ marching before with
two hundred and fifty Seamen, was follow’d by the Lieutenant-Colonel _De
Vries_, and he by a Company of _Negro_’s that carry’d Provisions; next
_Byma_ march’d with the Reserve. The Treasurer _John Gyseling_ also
accompanied the Army, which Encamp’d near _Francisco Brito Machado_’s
Wind-Mill, and Garrison’d the half-finish’d Fort near the Sugar-Mill
belonging to _Marcus Andre_, whilest three Companies Commanded by
Captain _De Vries_ march’d to _Monteroos-Mills_ to take the same; but
the _Portuguese_ lying in an Ambuscade had given them a shrewd Rebuke,
had not _Schuppe_, hearing the Guns, sent away the Captains _Picard_ and
_Garstman_, who coming out from amongst the Sugar-Canes, put the Enemy
to flight; yet the _Portuguese_ to increase daily, insomuch that they
got above two thousand Men together at _Arryal_, whilest the _Dutch_
Army began to want Provisions, wherefore _Jacob Huigen_ was order’d to
fetch a Supply from _Reciffa_; but as he was coming up the River with
the _Exeter_ Ketch, and a Boat hung about with Hides to secure his Men
from the Bullets, and being within Musquet-shot from the Works where
Captain _Schuppe_ lay, the Enemy’s whole Power shot so vehemently upon
him from the top of a Hill, that both the Ketch and Boat were sunk;
_Huigen_ himself receiv’d two mortal Wounds, and most of his Men were
kill’d, a few wounded onely escaping with Life. _Schuppe_ therefore was
forc’d to return for want of Provisions, and the rather, because he was
inform’d that _Bagnola_ was coming with a Supply of seven hundred Men.

Mean while the two Captains, _Smient_ and _Dunkirken_ perform’d a
valiant Exploit, _viz._ they went with a few Men in a Boat, and took a
great _Portuguese_ Vessel richly laden, having no more than four
Blunderbusses and their Swords in the Boat with them.

[Sidenote: A notable Victory of _Byma_ over _Francisco Almeda_.]

_Byma_ also fell upon the Village _Moriwere_, where he found most of the
People at Church. _Albuquerque_ inform’d thereof, sent two hundred Men
immediately, Commanded by _Francisco Almeda_, to intercept him in his
Return; but he marching on to _Tamarica_, they pursu’d him; he marching
but slowly, because the narrow Way was stopt up with fell’d Trees, they
overtook him half a League beyond _Garasu_, near _Peter Rocha_’s
Sugar-Mill; where after a sharp Encounter between them, a great
slaughter was made amongst the _Spaniards_, _Almeda_ and many other
Persons being slain, and the rest put to flight. _Byma_ having obtain’d
this Victory, march’d to _Garusa_ and burnt the same, sparing onely the
Churches and Cloysters, according to the Articles made between
_Albuquerque_ and _Rembach_.

_Schuppe_ prevented from crossing the River _Jangada_ by the many muddy
Creek, return’d back to _Reciffa_ with great Booty, which he had taken
out of a Store-house. The _Dutch_

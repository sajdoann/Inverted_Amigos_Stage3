A portion of this number of the AMERICAN MISSIONARY is filled with
a complete list of the names of the persons appointed for the
current year to the missionary fields at home and abroad where
this Association carries on its work. The work and the workers are
earnestly commended to the sympathies and prayers of the disciples
of the Lord everywhere.

THAT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS.

It is needed, and that is just why we fixed upon the amount. We are
not seeking to put forth a single effort or to carry out a solitary
measure not strenuously demanded by the circumstances. We think
Providence has plainly indicated to us that we should enlarge our
operations at some points and inaugurate new work at other points.
Of this we have been doubly assured by proffered gifts for specific
work that needed greatly to be done.

We have accepted the gifts in faith, fully aware that by so doing
we have placed ourselves under greater obligations than ever. If
God, however, has moved upon the hearts of good people to provide
buildings and funds for aggressive missionary endeavors, is it
not evident that He designs to sustain the work in its proper
development? His promises and providences surely warrant us in this
belief. The funds needful for carrying out the Lord’s plans can be
secured. Our concern is to understand and perform what we ought to
do to obtain them.

We make our appeal, first, to the churches. Is this Association on
your list of charities, and does it receive attention at least once
a year? Do you take the collection for it in the best way? Do you
give it a place in the monthly concert? Is it remembered in the
Sabbath School?

We appeal, secondly, to individuals. When you provide for the
charities of the year, do you make a liberal provision for the
redemption of the colored races in our land? Do you keep in
mind their relations to the highest welfare of the country? Do
you remember what part the negroes and Chinamen may take in the
conversion of Africa and China? May we not rely upon your gifts
even by hundreds and thousands as the months go on? We want that
three hundred thousand dollars; and nothing is more sure than
that it will come, provided churches in their several capacities,
and individuals in their large-hearted benevolence, will respond
promptly and prayerfully, according to their ability. If men and
women are ready to enter the dens of darkness and sin, to baffle
and destroy not the troublesome wolf—like young Putnam in our
nation’s early history—but Satan and his wicked devices, surely we
ought to be willing to furnish and hold the ropes.

THE NASHVILLE CONFERENCE.

A Conference of officers and workers of the American Missionary
Association was held at Fisk University, Nashville, Tenn., Dec. 26
and 27. There were present ex-Gov. Washburn, of Massachusetts, the
recently elected President of the Association; Rev. W. H. Ward,
D.D., and C. L. Mead, Esq., of New York, members of the Executive
Committee; Sec. Strieby, and Dr. Roy, Field Secretary. The teaching
force was represented by Pres. Cravath and Prof. Spence, of
Nashville, Tenn.; Pres. Ware and Prof. Farnham, of Atlanta, Ga.;
Pres. DeForest and Prof. Andrews, of Talladega, Ala.; Pres. Pope
and Prof. Hatch, of Tougaloo, Miss.; Pres. Alexander and Prof.
Jewett, of New Orleans, La.; Prof. Wright, of Savannah, Ga.; Prof.
Gordon, of Charleston, S.C.; Prof. Steele, of Memphis, Tenn.; Prof.
Hodge, of Macon, Ga.; and Rev. O. D. Crawford, of Mobile, Ala. Gen.
Armstrong, of Hampton, Va., and Pres. Fairchild, of Berea, Ky.,
though not directly connected with the Association, were present by
invitation and added largely to the interest of the gathering.

The meeting was convened to consider the whole educational work
of the Association in the South—with a view to its unity and
efficiency. Many of the teachers present had been long in the
service and brought to the discussion the benefits of large
experience and wide observation in regard to the educational
aptitudes and progress of the colored people.

Among the results were

1. That while the mass of this race must be educated for the
common walks of life, yet a competent number must be trained as
leaders in their progress; and as essential thereto, they need
many a Moses and many an Aaron, and these must be of their own
race. For these the best facilities ought to be furnished, and
such facilities should be near at hand. Statistics were presented
showing that at the West as well as at the South the students in
the colleges were from the immediate vicinity. Many a young man
gets a thorough education when the college is near who never would
get it if the college were distant. This is especially true of the
colored student, who can find work or teaching and cheap board near
home, which he could not find at a distance, to say nothing of the
expense of travel. In view of the facts, the Conference recommended
to the Association to strengthen the college departments in
Atlanta and Fisk, and introduce college studies in Talladega and
Straight as fast as the means and the fit student material would
justify.

2. It was shown that more and better theological instruction is
needed for the Freedmen. No race can rise without an intelligent
ministry. The young colored people of the present generation have
had some education themselves and demand better educated ministers,
and the half million of children now in school will contemn
religion or become infidels if left to the teachings of ignorant
pulpits. The Association was asked by the Conference to establish,
in addition to the Theological Department in Howard University, a
Theological Seminary further South, as soon as practicable, and to
sustain in efficiency the Theological Departments at Talladega and
Straight.

3. The review of the Industrial Departments was interesting and
satisfactory. The farm at Tougaloo produces largely the supply for
boarding-house table, and furnishes something for export—especially
strawberries. At Talladega the land is neither extensive nor very
fertile, yet yields fairly. Both farms furnish labor for the boys,
and the boarding departments there, as also in Atlanta, Fisk
and elsewhere, give employment to the girls. These Industrial
Departments do not pay pecuniarily, but they _do_ pay in healthy
mental and moral stamina, and in a preparation for practical life.
In view, however, of the difficulty in management and marketing, no
additional farm industries were recommended.

4. Much time was given and much interest manifested in discussing
the grading and unifying of the normal and preparatory schools,
and their relations to the higher institutions. Our most effective
work is felt to be here, for in these schools we meet the wants
of the masses directly, and lay the foundations for what we do in
the schools more advanced. The results of the Conference in this
regard, will, we are persuaded, secure greater unity and efficiency
in object-lesson teaching, normal training and practical business
education, as well as in giving more thorough preparation to those
who may enter the colleges.

Among the important results of the meeting are the better
acquaintance acquired by the teachers of each other and of the
work; and by the officers of the Association of the great and
diversified interests intrusted to its care.

A significant and encouraging fact in the progress of the meeting
was the voluntary and very welcome presence of Dr. J. Berrien
Lindsley, Secretary of the State Board of Education, and Mr. Doak,
State Superintendent of Education. These gentlemen expressed, in
the strongest terms, their high appreciation of the work the A. M.
A. is doing in the South, and from their position and opportunities
few men have better knowledge on the subject than they.

The day is not far distant when the South and North will see eye
to eye, and will work hand to hand in the great endeavor to
elevate the colored race, and the A. M. A. may well rejoice in the
part she is taking in bringing about this harmony, and in the great
achievement to be attained.

       *       *       *       *       *

WE would again remind our readers that our Annual Report is ready
for distribution, and we shall be glad to send it to any who wish a
copy, and will so signify to us by postal card or letter.

       *       *       *       *       *

THE WORK AT HOME, a monthly record of the Woman’s Home Missionary
Association, is gotten up in an attractive manner; price, 25
cents per annum, subscriptions to be sent to Miss Laura W. Bliss,
20 Congregational House, Boston, Mass. We bid the publication
God-speed.

       *       *       *       *       *

WE are happy to announce that through the liberality of Mr. Edward
Smith, of Enfield, Mass., we have purchased thirteen acres of land
in Little Rock, Ark., for a new institution of learning. A charter
for a college and plans for the first school building will be
secured without unreasonable delay. The character of the school
will be similar to that of our other chartered institutions.

and who earned his knighthood by his services in connection with
the abolition of the slave trade and the advance of civilization in
East Africa, is now in England.

       *       *       *       *       *


THE INDIANS.

—A small congregation of full-blooded Chickasaw Indians lately gave
$400 for Foreign Missions.

—In the spring of 1881, seventeen Indian slaves at Sitka were freed
through the efforts of Captain Henry Glass, of the United States
ship Jamestown.

—The Baptists have built a steam launch of 100 tons measurement for
mission work in Alaska, British Columbia and Washington Territory.
She is 82 feet long, with a cabin 25 x 15 feet.

—The Cherokees, Choctaws, Creeks, Chickasaws and Seminole Indians,
to the number of 60,560, have over 16,000 houses. During the years
1879 and 1880, from the 273,000 acres they have under cultivation
they raised over half a million of bushels of wheat and 176,500
tons of hay. They have 195 schools with 6,250 scholars, or
one-tenth of the population. For education during the year they
expended $156,856, or $29.09 for each scholar, 2,650 of whom
learned to read the same year.

—At the Klawack Cannery, an Indian one day, abusing some others
with offensive epithets learned from the whites, they at once fell
to fighting. A trader inquiring what he said to them, they replied
they didn’t know, only when white men used those words they went to
fighting, and so the Indians thought that was the proper thing for
them to do.

       *       *       *       *       *


CHINESE.

—The return of the Chinese students, about which so much is said,
it seems was occasioned partly by the fact that the Chinese
government wished to utilize their acquirements. Several of
them have been called into the service of telegraph lines just
completed, and others will enter the army, the navy and the
arsenals.

—The Japanese, the Yankees of the East, have lately been getting
up a corner in silk, and European silk traders have been forced to
accept the terms dictated by a syndicate of native growers.

—There are now in North China about 100 villages where there are
natives who have declared themselves disciples of Christ, and in
as many as thirty centres they meet on Sunday for worship and the
study of the Scriptures.

—In Japan, 90 per cent. of the people are able to read. In the
United States, only 80 per cent.; in England, 67; in China, 50, and
in India 5 per cent.

—China spends $150,000,000 annually in ancestral worship.

—Japan has set an example that might well be followed by some
continental nations. The government was requested for permission
to hold a lottery in order to dispose of such articles as remained
unsold at the national exhibition. They refused on moral grounds,
and went to the expense of purchasing all the goods themselves in
order to avoid the risk of an immoral example.

BUILDINGS AT TOUGALOO, MISS.

BY REV. A. HATCH.

The aim of the educational work here is, in a word, to fit our
students for practical life and to instruct in the art of teaching.
A course of six years, after that of our primary grade, completes
the regular normal course. In addition to a long and thorough drill
in the more common and elementary branches, this course requires
three terms each of United States history, Latin and algebra, two
each of philosophy and geometry, one of physiology, natural history
and science of government and four terms of Bible study.

A small one-story house neatly finished off with Southern pine
from ceiled roof to wainscoting is reserved for the primary school
where, in limited numbers, children from the plantations around are
permitted to attend. The chief object here is to furnish a model
school for our normal classes and a place where they can both learn
by observation and practice for themselves under an experienced
teacher who comes from the North expressly to have charge of this
room. Besides this teacher our corps of instructors is seven
strong, including one who is almost exclusively music teacher.

Something of external enlargement has fallen to the lot of Tougaloo
within a year past. The beginning of the last winter term brought a
crowd of students who, with difficulty, could find a lodging place
among us, owing to the lack of buildings. The young men, many of
them, had to make the best of the rudest sort of apartments. It was
when every available room apparently was full, and shortly after
a number of students had been sent away, that the “chapel,” with
its second floor devoted to rooms for twenty-eight young men, took
fire and burned to the ground. This building, never even in its
best days a very commodious, convenient, or cheery place, was the
best we had, excepting, perhaps, the “mansion.” On the first floor
were a low-walled chapel-room, serving the purposes of school-room,
assembly-room and church, and two small recitation-rooms. In one
of these was kept the small library of the institution. This
library embraced sets of the New American Cyclopædia and the Family
Library, some 300 or more Sunday-school books, a few miscellaneous
volumes—the gifts of individuals—and a considerable collection of
Congressional books, reports, etc., sent to the Normal Department
from Washington. The greater part of this incipient library was
saved. The sets above mentioned, however, which our students were
beginning to appreciate and use intelligently, were broken up.

[Illustration: STRIEBY HALL, TOUGALOO, MISS.]

There was an insurance on the chapel of $3,000. Something had
been previously accumulating through special solicitations and
the benevolence of friends, for enlarging the hall for young
women. That addition was in progress at the time of the fire. This
building contained the boarding and laundry departments of the
school. It had rooms for thirty-two young women. It was proposed to
enlarge it by adding another story to the long two-story structure
already on the ground, and also a three-story wing, furnishing
in all accommodations for seventy-two girls, besides containing
two good-sized sitting-rooms, a pleasant sewing-room, and private
apartments for the matron and five teachers. This has been
completed.

Early last spring, funds were forthcoming for a new hall for young
men. Work was immediately begun. A fair crop of “Mississippi brick”
was raised on the spot. A sufficient number of men were employed
to push on rapidly the work of building. A commodious and pleasing
hall 41 × 112 feet stands ready for students.

A deep, roomy basement extends under the whole building, furnishing
rooms not only for uses connected with the hall, but also those
connected with certain of the industrial departments. The
first floor affords us a large room for chapel, two convenient
recitation-rooms, an office, and apartments for a small family.

The second and third floors are used as dormitories. The rooms,
34 in number, are of good size, light and airy, neatly and
substantially, though simply, furnished. While in the construction
of Strieby Hall strict economy has been studied, modern ideas of
convenience have been introduced. Water is brought to each floor
from large tanks underneath the roof. A large bath-room is on the
second floor.

The large “mansion,” which has served a great variety of purposes,
has now been turned for the most part into school uses. It has two
large recitation-rooms, a library, a reading-room, two music-rooms,
besides an office and suitable rooms for one family and guests.

These four buildings, together with the neat little cottage for
the president and his family, comprise the chief externals of
Tougaloo University. The old building for young men, known as the
“Barracks,” is to take its proper and more humble place among the
barns and outhouses connected with the farm.

INDUSTRIAL WORK AT TOUGALOO.

BY PRES. G. S. POPE.

In considering the desirableness of having Industrial departments
in connection with any of our schools, it is necessary, of course,
to decide as nearly as possible what the expense of establishing
and maintaining such departments will be, and what the advantage to
the pupil. In other departments of training it is found necessary
to secure liberal endowments in order to meet expenses. Why should
more be asked of this? We sustain our Theological departments to
train men to be successful preachers of the Word. We sustain our
Industrial departments to train them to be successful business men.
But one is direct Christian and missionary work. So is the other.
God first put man to pruning the garden, not to preaching the
gospel. And whatever is done to make the world again a garden is
evidently in the line of God’s plan. It is certainly possible for
us to give too little weight to the training of workmen. I suppose
it is expected that I will present my thoughts in the shadow of
experience.

The Industrial department at Tougaloo University embraces:
1. General Farming. 2. Strawberry Culture. 3. Gardening. 4.
Stock-Raising. 5. General Housework. 6. Work in Laundry. 7. Work in
Sewing-Room.

In our general farming we have confined our work to those crops
that we can consume on the place—corn, oats and potatoes. We expect
to cultivate cotton hereafter, rotating it with other crops. Corn
yields fairly, but not equal to the West, of course. The oat crop,
I think, can be made equal to the Western crop. We have done enough
with grasses to satisfy ourselves that grass can be very profitable
grown and marketed.

The strawberry crop can be grown, picked and marketed almost
entirely with student labor. We have to hire a little outside help
during the picking season. This is both a pleasant and profitable
industry. We can begin shipping about April 10, or earlier,
according to the season. Chicago is our market. The garden is a
great help in supplying our table, and in any of our schools we
ought to be able to cultivate a garden for the family with student
labor with good results. But gardening for profit must be _taught_,
and requires skill and means.

Four years ago we ventured to purchase a little thoroughbred
Ayrshire and grade Jersey stock. We had no appropriation for such
purchases, but felt that we must make a beginning. We needed
the milk to use. We had land and must utilize it. The scholars
needed to be taught the value of good cows. We have not only
awakened interest in the minds of the students, in the matter of
stock-raising, but also in the minds of some of the old planters
about us.

The general housework and the work in the laundry and sewing-room
have been well managed under the oversight of our matron and
others, but in these, as in other departments already mentioned,
the returns seem slight when compared with the expense of
sustaining the labor.

If we look at some of the difficulties, we shall perhaps feel more
forcibly the absolute need of sustaining industrial schools. The
people know nothing in the line of general farmwork, except the
culture of corn and cotton in the old way. They know nothing of
the value of rotation in crops, underdraining, fertilizing, etc.
They know nothing of the use and care of improved implements. There
has been no sense of responsibility developed in them. They break
tools, misplace them, lose them. A new set of hands use the tools
and teams each day of the week. In a jolly, good-natured way, time
is killed, and but little is accomplished. These faults must be
corrected. This takes time and patience. Meanwhile the leakage and
breakage and drainage is _costing_. In the strawberry field we have
not the advantage of skilled pickers and packers, but must put new
hands in the field each year. In the garden, the boys want to use
the big cotton hoes, and cut and slash as they do in the field, and
so they tear up the tomatoes and root up the rutabagas, and cut up
the cabbages. Many of the boys have never had a fork or a rake in
their hands. They know how to “gear up” a mule to plow, but would
be utterly lost if they should undertake to put a decent harness on
a horse and hitch him into a wagon.

In the housework the girls are no more responsible about their
sweeping and scrubbing, their washing and wiping, than the boys are
on the farm. In the laundry they often forget to kindle the fire
until it is time to commence ironing. Then they must stand and wait
for the irons to heat. In the wash-room they would as soon use a
box of soap as a bar. In the sewing-room they sew and then rip,
and then sew up again and rip out again. The girls have followed
the plow or trundled baby wagons, and know nothing about sewing,
knitting, darning, or anything else that fits them for real home
life.

Multitudes of young men have their hearts set upon the pulpit
and platform while there is scarcely one in ten thousand who is
learning a trade. Our carpenters and masons, our tinners and
shoemakers are men who are in middle life, or whose heads are
frosted for the grave. These young people that we are educating
will need school-houses and churches and court-houses; but the
way things are going now, there will be no one to build them
after their fathers are gone. In view of these facts, we have
urged the establishment of shops where trades can be taught, but
we are headed off with the fact that we cannot pay expenses. Do
other departments of training pay expenses? Wherever the work of
training is done, expense is incurred. But people will give to
make teachers and preachers. Ah! they forget that the Lord Jesus
worked in a carpenter’s shop before he preached the glad tidings;
that Peter learned the art of catching fish before he caught men;
and that Paul made tents for depraved men to use as homes in this
world before he told them of the heavenly mansions. What is needed
in these young people is the development of character. Manliness,
womanliness, self-reliance can only be developed by a course of
training that teaches hands, heads and hearts at the same time.

I have spoken of the comparative expense of our industries, but it
is by no means all outgo and no income. I have no balance sheet
to present with this paper, but the milk goes from the stable to
the pantry by the bucketful, the vegetables from the garden to
the kitchen by the basketful, and the strawberries from the field
to the fruit-room by the crateful. Besides the berries used in
our family, we receive from $25 to $100 net per acre from those
shipped. We have raised this year $700 worth of sweet potatoes.
At very moderate prices we have on hand now at least one thousand
dollars worth of thoroughbred and grade stock over and above what
has been paid for it. I think I am safe in saying that in spite of
all the difficulties, in ordinary seasons, our outside work brings
in enough to pay for the labor put upon it.

But suppose our industries bring in no returns, but are constant
sources of expense; still the fact remains that great value comes
through them to the boys and girls. There is a discipline gained in
being obliged to do work thoroughly, and a self respect developed
in them in the effort to earn something with which to pay expenses,
instead of being carried like babies, that is simply invaluable.

MISSIONARY WORK AT NEW ORLEANS.

BY MISS LENA SAUNDERS.

The month just past has been replete with special Divine mercies,
though marked by much sickness in the families of those interested
in the school and church. One of our scholars went Home early in
the month and another lies “waiting for the boatman” close by the
river. She seems fully trusting in Jesus though suffering intensely
and praying to die. She asks that all her schoolmates at the hall
pray for her. She has walked six miles a day on her way to and
from school, and now in her feeble talks dwells entirely upon
the school and Heaven. My Sunday-school class has increased in
numbers to 53. The little ones have been specially interested in
the black-board exercises, and read the pictures in a peculiarly
quaint way. The account of the “brass snake” lifted up in the
wilderness particularly fascinated them. Reviewing the story of
Balaam a few Sundays since, I asked the class what kind of man
Balaam was, expecting them to remember the answer from the golden
text. One little fellow replied “a double-jinted man.” The pastor
opened the door in time to join in the smiling. I had to learn that
“double-jointed” is a term applied to persons who say one thing
and do another. The sewing-school is well attended. The mother’s
meeting is making its influence felt by the regular members going
out and bringing in those who attend no other service.

STORRS CHURCH, ATLANTA, GA

BY REV. EVARTS KENT.

The Church is raising $30 per month on pastor’s salary, beginning
from 1st of October last. I am sure you will be glad to know that
we close the year with all indebtedness of every sort _paid_, and a
trifling sum in the treasury. There was something of a deficiency,
but we rallied last Wednesday evening and made it good. Besides,
by vote of the Church at the same time, that was practically
unanimous, we enrolled ourselves among the number of giving
churches, pledging an annual contribution to the three missionary
societies of our order, and another for church building. Our
contributions may not be large; they will certainly be something.
Congregation continues good. Bad weather has reduced somewhat the
attendance at prayer meeting and Sunday-school; but both have been
well attended and full of interest. Acting upon my suggestion at
the Sunday-school concert, Christmas evening, the school brought
birthday gifts to the Saviour in the form of remembrances for the
poor; more than 100 packages were brought to the table; clothing,
groceries, etc. It was most touching to witness the gifts brought
to the Lord Jesus in this way from some of the very poorest of
our children. The next morning, in a pouring rain, the pastor and
deacons distributed these offerings. I hope our people gained some
insight into the real meaning of the day.

AFRICA.

EXTRACTS FROM LETTERS OF REV. H. M. LADD.

CAIRO, EGYPT, Nov. 28, 1881.—We are off at last. The delay has been
inevitable. No sooner would we make a plan than the bottom would
fall out of it. About sixteen bottoms have fallen out. However,
we have some reason to hope that the last one will stick unless
all men are liars, or unless there should be an explosion or an
upheaval of the Nile, or unless there should be something else. It
is never best to be too sure about anything in this country.

The quarantine has also thrown all our plans into confusion. We
tried all sorts of schemes to obtain a passage down the Red Sea
and get landed at Souakim without quarantine, but every plan
failed and we determined to go up the Nile. Then we heard by
chance (everything seems to go by chance here) that the Egyptian
steamboats had given up calling at Jedda, and that we could go
direct to Souakim. We commenced telegraphing at once to Suez. Four
times we telegraphed, and finally learned that one steamer would go
direct to Souakim without quarantine, but that it would sail before
we could catch it, and that there would not be another one for a
month.

So again we gave up the Red Sea, and returned to the Nile route.
We planned to go by rail to Siout, thence by postal steamer to
Assouan. The steamer was to leave Siout on Wednesday; we must leave
here on Tuesday; our baggage must leave by freight train on Monday,
and to make sure of its getting on to the train it must be sent to
the station on Sunday. So we got it ready on Saturday by working
hard, and sent it to the station, and were quietly informed that
there was no train that would take it till Tuesday, except for an
enormous sum, and that as the boat left now on Tuesday instead of
Wednesday we could not reach it any how. This all meant three days
more of delay. * * * So we leave to-day, after taking the best
advices we could possibly get on the subject, determined to push
on up the river and cross the long Korosko Desert, which is the
shortest though not the easiest route now open to us. We are both
in excellent health and spirits and start off with much to cheer
us. They tell us there is plenty of good weather before us in which
to reach Fatiko or Lake Albert Nyanza, if we shall think it best to
do so on reaching Khartoum.

ASSYOUT or SIOUT, Dec. 2.—We arrived here last evening, and expect
to start onward at 3 A.M. to-night. The American missionaries have
entertained us very hospitably, and send us on our way rejoicing.

ASSOUAN, Dec. 9.—We have reached the borders of Nubia in safety,
and shall set sail to-morrow noon for Korosko. This is far better
than we expected to do, as we were told we should be detained here
three or four days. We have taken three Arabs into our company and
thereby reduced our expenses to Khartoum. Everything now looks well
for us. We shall try to reach Korosko in three days from here. The
Governor of this district has ordered camels to be ready for us.
From Korosko we shall try to make the desert from Nile to Nile in
eight days, and in five more to reach Berber.

KOROSCO, NUBIA, Dec. 12.—We found our camels ready for us, and we
shall start into the great desert early to-morrow morning. To-day
the men are making the necessary preparation in the way of food,
etc. The Governer here, acting under orders from down the river,
is very attentive. The water at Murat, the only point where there
is any on the desert, is bad, and cannot be used for drinking; we
shall, therefore, have to carry enough to last us till we reach
Aboo Hamed and the river again. The doctor has had his hands full,
attending to all sorts of people with all sorts of troubles, and
evidently is destined to be quite in demand. We are both well and
in good trim for the journey.

THE CHINESE.

       *       *       *       *       *


NOTES FROM THE FIELD.

BY REV. W. C. POND.

1. The statistical reports for November are in some respects more
encouraging than ever; thirteen schools in operation, having an
aggregate enrolled membership of 700—a round number, but an exact
one. Never before did our aggregate rise so high. The average
attendance was 339. Ten of our pupils received baptism, and four or
five others, as having begun the Christian life, were accepted as
members of the “Association of Christian Chinese,” there to remain
under further instruction for six months or more before they are
baptized. Twenty-nine teachers were employed, of whom ten were
Chinese helpers—uniting service in the field with special training
for a larger Gospel-work. Some of these, I hope, may yet preach
Christ in China, under the direction of our American Missionary
Association.

2. The Marysville Chinese Mission celebrated its second anniversary
on Sunday evening, December 11. The Presbyterian Church in that
city—a spacious and beautiful edifice—was filled, and the audience
was evidently greatly interested. At the close of a dialogue on
the question why a Chinaman should become a Christian, and of the
address in English by our helper, Lee Sam, the interest pressed
beyond due bounds, and broke forth into applause. One memorable
feature of the service was the baptism of six Chinese. From the
statement of the teacher, Miss Mattie A. Flint, as presented at
this meeting and since then published in _The Pacific_, I make the
following extracts:

“The school has been maintained without interruption except on
occasional holidays. In connection with it a Sunday-school has been
sustained, meeting every Sabbath at 6 o’clock in the evening. The
total number of Chinese enrolled as pupils in the Mission School
is 98. All these have been, for a shorter or longer period, under
our influence, and must have learned something about Jesus and his
power to save from sin. The average membership, month by month,
has been about 35. The largest average attendance in any one month
was 23. The average attendance for the year, 17. * * * Ten of the
pupils have joined the Association during the past year. From among
the members of the Association five have been baptized and received
in the Presbyterian Church, and six others are now recommended for
baptism. We rejoice greatly in the fruit of our labors. I pray God
for still richer harvests in time to come.

“One of those baptized and received to the church has returned to
China. I venture to give the following extract from a letter which
I received from him a few weeks since: ‘We meet on the steamer
three Christian brothers beside me. I feel comfortable in the way
my home. They about five hundred of my country men in the steamer.
But they are all heathen; we are preacher for them. They are never
heard the gospel of life, and some very glad to hear us, and some
are not. How wonderful our Heavenly Father has make this world! We
are cross the great ocean, we ought thank Him for His kindness for
us and His love. When we get near Japan they are idolatrous people
to ask for us to give money to sacrifice idols goddess. I say no;
if I have money I would like to put on missionary fund. But they
are scold and angry for us. But we are not afraid for them. Jesus
Christ with us always.’”

THE BETHANY CHURCH OF MARYSVILLE.—A variety of considerations which
could not be fully stated without trespassing too largely upon your
space led us to believe that the time had come when our brethren
in Marysville should be organized into a church of Christ. Rev.
P. L. Carden, pastor of the Presbyterian Church, very cordially
seconded the proposition, and proffered letters of dismission and
recommendation to such of our Chinese brethren as had already
been admitted to his church. The brethren themselves received the
proposal with great joy.

It was a new step in the history of our own work among the Chinese
of this State, though in connection with other missions two or
three churches composed exclusively of Chinese have existed for
many years. It was taken after much prayer, and with a peaceful
assurance that the Master himself led us that way. The matter
was talked over with the brethren somewhat carefully on Sunday
afternoon; and then after the anniversary exercises over, we
remained at the Mission House till late at night, explaining to
them the simple confession of Faith and Covenant of the Bethany
Church, San Francisco, which they adopted as their own. My
inquiries into the Christian experience of one and another gave
me still greater joy than I had before in view of our Marysville
work, and at the end of this meeting it was agreed to gather at the
Mission House at 2:30 P.M. of Monday, and organize the church. This
plan was carried out, several American Christians being present
with us and adding their prayers and cordial God-speed; and I could
easily find it in my heart to wish that every church organized in
America had in it nine such happy, hearty, praying, working young
men as this Bethany Church in Marysville has.

3. OROVILLE.—We had scarcely concluded the meeting above
referred to, when it became time to take the train for Oroville,
twenty-eight miles distant. I took our faithful helper, Lee Sam,
with me, desiring him to spend two or three months at least in
Oroville. Here I found a sad state of things. Sufficient care had
not been taken in receiving members to our Association there, and
I am afraid that few, if any, among them are true Christians. In
a strife for the pre-eminence they had become bitter, one toward
another, and I hoped, and still hope, that the good judgment, the
gentle spirit, the Christian example and the faithful preaching of
Lee Sam will, with the blessing of God, set things right again. The
school in Oroville is blessed with a very faithful teacher, who
is aided and guided by her father, Rev. A. Ostrom, pastor of the
Congregational Church, himself formerly a missionary in China. Mr.
Ostrom speaks Chinese, but not in the dialect of the districts from
which our Chinese have come, and he cannot communicate with them,
except through the English language. We ought to have had a good
helper there six months ago, but I had not the man to spare, nor
the funds to sustain him. Now I leave Marysville destitute, that
Oroville may be supplied.

We spent Monday and Tuesday evenings till a very late hour seeking
to secure mutual forgiveness and to bring peace. We succeeded so
far as the weaker party was concerned; and the confession of fault
and the request for forgiveness were made with tearful eyes. But as
to the other, and hitherto the controlling faction, no relenting
could be made to appear. They have since withdrawn and set up some
sort of a house and a worship by themselves. But I believe that
our prayers will be answered, and that out of all this will come
shortly a far better work than has ever yet been done for the
thousands of Chinese who centre at this town.

4. The mission-house at Santa Barbara was burned to the ground in
the latter part of November. It was a rented building, and the
most valuable part of the mission escaped the flames, so that the
loss was not great. I record with much thankfulness the fact that
the Congregational Church in Santa Barbara, notwithstanding that
it had, just the week before, completed an offering of $327.50 for
our Theological Seminary, and scarcely a month before had made a
generous contribution to our Mission, at once took a collection
amounting to $27.55 to repair the damages of this fire. The origin
of the fire is hard to explain. Our helper regards it as no
accident, but as having come from the hatred of heathen Chinese.

“TESSIE.”

BY A. WESTON W.

“Dunno, miss.”

“But, Tessie, you must know where you got it.”

“’Deed, miss, I dunno no more’n de dade. I nebber tuk it none: it
jes’ comed.”

“Just came! O Tessie, Tessie! are you never going to be good?”

“I is good, miss,” said the little colored girl, who could not seem
to learn how very wicked it is to take other people’s property, and
who had never been taught it is wrong to tell an untruth.

“Yes, Tessie, you are good about some things,” I said; “but you
are not good when you take things out of my room, as you did last
night.”

“Deed, miss, I nebber tuk it none: it jes’ comed.”

“Tessie,” I said solemnly, “what will you do when God asks you
about this.”

“I jes’ say I dunno nuffin’ ’tall ’bout it.”

“But you can’t tell a lie about it to God, for he saw you take it.”

“Reckon ye’re out dar, ’cause it were dark as Egyp,” said Tessie,
grinning at me, and showing a row of white teeth and a pair of
large black eyes.

“But, Tessie,” I said, “that makes no difference; God sees you all
the time, and knows what you do in the dark, just as well as what
you do when it is light.”

The girl’s expression changed, and she looked about her stealthily,
as though in some dark corner she expected to see some one looking
at her. Failing in that, she looked back at me, and said:

“’Tain’t wurth while ter vex ’im.”

“No, Tessie,” I said, “it’s not right to vex any one who has been
kind to us; and God does more for us than any earthly friends we
have.”

“Reckon ef I puts it back in de dark agin, he’ll see it?”

“Yes, Tessie, God will see you, whether you put it back at night,
or in the day.”

“Den it’ll be all right?”

“If you make up your mind never to take again what does not belong
to you.”

“S’posen His head’s turned round the wrong way, an’ He don’t see
me?”

“God’s head is never turned round, Tessie; it is always towards us.”

That evening I watched Tessie to see the effect of our
conversation, and soon after dark I discovered her on her way to my
room, with the little thermometer she had taken from it the night
before.

After that, there seemed to be a decided change in Tessie, which
pleased me very much; but I was even more pleased when, one day, I
found her with a bottle of cologne in her hand, and heard what she
was saying.

“I reckon it smells kind o’ good, an’ I reckon I’d like ter hab it;
but de good God’s a-lookin’ on, an’ he moight ax ’bout it some day.”

My little friends, would it not be well if we could take that as a
sort of watch-word—“He might ask about it some day”? Do we not all
do little things quietly, in a kind of slurring way, as if they
wouldn’t count? And yet we would be ashamed to be asked about them.
Remember that everything counts, and that “He might ask about it
some day.”—_Well-Spring._

THE AMERICAN MISSIONARY ASSOCIATION.

       *       *       *       *       *


AIM AND WORK.

To preach the Gospel to the poor. It originated in a sympathy with
the almost friendless slaves. Since Emancipation it has devoted its
main efforts to preparing the FREEDMEN for their duties as citizens
and Christians in America, and as missionaries in Africa. As
closely related to this, it seeks to benefit the caste-persecuted
CHINESE in America, and to co-operate with the Government in its
humane and Christian policy toward the INDIANS. It has also a
mission in AFRICA.

WANTS.

1. A steady INCREASE of regular income to keep pace with the
growing work. This increase can only be reached by _regular_ and
_larger_ contributions from the churches, the feeble as well as the
strong.

2. ADDITIONAL BUILDINGS for our higher educational institutions, to
accommodate the increasing numbers of students; MEETING HOUSES for
the new churches we are organizing; MORE MINISTERS, cultured and
pious, for these churches.

3. HELP FOR YOUNG MEN, to be educated as ministers here and
missionaries to Africa—a pressing want.

Before sending boxes, always correspond with the nearest A. M. A.
office as below:

  NEW YORK       H. W. Hubbard, Esq., Treasurer, 56 Reade street.
  BOSTON         Rev. C. L. Woodworth, Dis’t Sec., Room 21
                   Congregational House.
  CHICAGO        Rev. Jas. Powell, Dis’t Sec., 112 West Washington
                   street.


MAGAZINE.

This Magazine will be sent gratuitously, if desired, to the
Missionaries of the Association; to Life Members; to all Clergymen
who take up collections for the Association; to Superintendents of
Sabbath-schools; to College Libraries; to Theological Seminaries;
to Societies of Inquiry on Missions; and to every donor who does
not prefer to take it as a subscriber, and contributes in a year
not less than five dollars.

Those who wish to remember the AMERICAN MISSIONARY ASSOCIATION in
their last Will and Testament are earnestly requested to use the
following


FORM OF A BEQUEST.

“I BEQUEATH to my executor (or executors) the sum of ——— dollars,
in trust, to pay the same in ——— days after my decease to the
person who, when the same is payable, shall act as Treasurer of the
‘American Missionary Association’ of New York City, to be applied,
under the direction of the Executive Committee of the Association,
to its charitable uses and purposes.”

The Will should be attested by three witnesses (in some States
three are required, in other States only two), who should write
against their names their places of residence (if in cities,
their street and number). The following form of attestation will
answer for every State in the Union: “Signed, sealed, published
and declared by the said (A. B.) as his last Will and Testament,
in presence of us, who, at the request of the said A. B., and in
his presence, and in the presence of each other, have hereunto
subscribed our names as witnesses.” In some States it is required
that the Will should be made at least two months before the death
of the testator.

                           N.Y. WITNESS.


☞ There will be many important events occurring during the
coming year that you will not know about unless you take the
WITNESS. Do you know now, for instance, that a sober and Christian
young man, a private soldier of the U. S. Army, has been thrown
into prison and subjected to great privations and indignities by
his superior officers—treated worse than the miserable wretch
Guiteau—for writing a letter to the WITNESS—a letter which is of
great importance to all young men and all parents? There are many
things published in the WITNESS that other papers dare not print,
for fear of offending some rich and powerful corporation, and so
losing their patronage.

                 The price of the WITNESS is $1.50
                  a year, post-paid; club price,
                      five for $6.00. Sample
                          copy sent free.

Ministers, Missionaries, Evangelists of all Denominations, and

                           HYGEIA HOTEL.


Fortress Monroe, which is the largest single fortification in the
world, is at Old Point Comfort. The situation is unsurpassed for
healthfulness; and it is the custom of the Government to send
troops there to recuperate that have seen hard service elsewhere.
The climate is singularly mild, but bracing, and for persons with
delicate lungs, coming from a northern climate, it is admirably
adapted, as the atmosphere is not so debilitating as that of more
tropical resorts. In common with most of Eastern Virginia it enjoys
entire immunity from all violent forms of eruptive diseases and
fevers. Measles and scarlet fever, on being brought there, assume
perfectly mild and tractable types. Malarial fevers are absolutely
unknown, and not a single case of typhoid fever was ever known
to originate at Old Point. Many physicians believe that genuine
typhoid fever is unknown in Eastern Virginia, the disease going
by that name being perfectly manageable and non-contagious. The
temperature is remarkably even, being exempt from torrid heats and
frigid cold. The Artillery School of the United States is located
here, and Hampton Roads, the finest roadstead in the world, is a
rendezvous for naval ships. Hampton, the oldest town in Virginia,
and containing the oldest church on this continent, is within
three miles, over a shell road. There, also, is located the State
Normal School, for the education of negroes and Indians; and
between Hampton and Old Point is the Soldiers’ Home, for disabled
veterans. The HYGEIA, the only hotel allowed by the Government, is
substantial and elegant, and accommodates a thousand guests. It is
about one hundred yards from the wharf, and the water comes to the
foot of the plazas, of which there are about 35,000 square feet in
the house, 15,000 of which are inclosed with glass, which enables
the most delicate invalid to enjoy the sunlight and sea view. Hot
and cold sea baths are on every floor. It has elevators, electric
bells, etc. It is one minute’s walk from the fortress. Daily
communication is had with New York by the Old Dominion Steamship
Company, with Baltimore by the Bay Line steamers, and with
Washington by the Potomac Steamboat Company, and a branch of the
Merchants’ and Miners’ Transportation Company, all these steamers
proceeding to Norfolk, which is thirteen miles away; with Richmond
by the Old Dominion Line and the James River Steamboat Company. It
is on the direct route of travel to the South. The hotel has no
particular season, but is under the same _régime_ the whole year
round. The records of the Meteorological Observatory, for the past
ten years, show an average temperature of 60°, 74°, 76°, in summer;
70°, 59°, 40° in autumn; 45°, 44°, 42°, in winter; and 48°, 52°,
63°, for spring.

                    THE GREAT BIBLE DICTIONARY.

                         BY WILLIAM SMITH.


  Unabridged, enlarged and corrected. Edited by H. B. HACKETT,
  D.D., and Prof. EZRA ABBOT. 4 volumes, 3,667 pages, with 596
  illustrations. Price in cloth, $20; sheep, $25; half morocco,
  $30; half Russia, $35; full morocco, $40; full Russia, $45.

There are several American editions of Smith’s Dictionary of the
Bible, but this is the only edition which comprises the contents of
the original English edition, unabridged, with very considerable
and important additions by Professors Hackett and Abbot, and
twenty-six other eminent American scholars.

No similar work in our own or any other language is for a moment to
be compared with it.—_Quarterly Review_ (London).

There cannot be two opinions about the merits of Smith’s Bible
Dictionary. What was, to begin with, the best book of its kind in
our language, is now still better.—_Prof. Roswell D. Hitchcock._

In paper, presswork, cuts, maps, etc., we do not see anything to
choose between this and the more costly English original; while in
a multitude of other respects which affect the trustworthiness,
thoroughness, and supreme excellence of the work as a thesaurus of
Biblical knowledge, this is vastly to be preferred.—_Congregational
Review_ (Boston).

THE AMERICAN MISSIONARY.

The improvement in missionary literature is well known.
Explorations, heroic endeavors of missionaries and their great
achievements have given glowing themes alike to author and artist.
Communications from the field, encouraging incidents and pictorial
illustrations have combined to afford a wealth of interest to young
and old.

We are keenly alive to the necessity of keeping the AMERICAN
MISSIONARY abreast with the very best publications of other
missionary societies, at home and abroad. We shall seek to make its
appearance attractive by pictures and illustrations. The Children’s
Page will contain original stories and suggestive incidents. The
General Notes on Africa, the Chinese and Indians will be continued.
The fullest information will be given about our work in the South,
now recognized as so important to the welfare of the nation, and
about our labors in Africa—that land whose fate so stirs the heart
of Christendom. The journal of our exploring party of missionaries
up the Nile will be given monthly. The editorial department will
reflect the missionary zeal and work over the whole field, and add
its influence to aid every good agency for the world’s redemption.

No Christian family can afford to be without missionary
intelligence, and no missionary society can afford to be without
readers of its publications; it had better give them to the readers
without pay than to have no readers. Missionary zeal will die in
the churches without missionary intelligence.

But it would be far better for both the societies and the readers
if missionary news were paid for. This would give the magazine
attentive perusal and the society relief from the reproach of a
large expense for publication. Missionary publications should be
put on a _paying basis_. Aside from a free list to life members,
ministers, etc., the cost of publication should be made up by
paying subscribers and advertisements.

We are anxious to put the AMERICAN MISSIONARY on this basis. We
intend to make it worth its price, and we ask our patrons to aid us:

1. More of our readers can take pains to send us either the
moderate subscription price (50 cents), or $1.00, naming a friend
to whom we may send a second copy.

2. A special friend in each church can secure subscribers at
club-rates (12 copies for $5 or 25 copies for $10).

3. Business men can benefit themselves by advertising in a
periodical that has a circulation of 20,000 copies monthly and that
goes to many of the best men and families in the land. Will not our
friends aid us to make this plan a success?

Subscriptions and advertisements should be sent to H. W. HUBBARD,
Treasurer, 56 Reade st., New York, N.Y.

be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily

in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:

    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    
    • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

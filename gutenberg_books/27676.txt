Notes and Definitions


In addition to the updating of information, the following
changes have been made in this edition of The World
Factbook. The name Wake Island has been officially changed
to Wake Atoll. The Historical perspective and Current issues
entries in the Introduction category have been combined into
a new Background entry. It appears in only a few country
profiles at this time. There are new entries on Population
below poverty line, Household income or consumption by
percentage share, Electricity--production by source (fossil
fuel, hydro, nuclear, other), Electricity--exports, and
Electricity--imports. A new reference map of Kosovo has been
included and terrain has been added to most of the reference
maps.

Abbreviations: This information is included in Appendix A:
Abbreviations, which includes all abbreviations and acronyms
used in the Factbook, with their expansions.

Administrative divisions: This entry generally gives the
numbers, designatory terms, and first-order administrative
divisions as approved by the US Board on Geographic Names
(BGN). Changes that have been reported but not yet acted on
by BGN are noted.

Age structure: This entry provides the distribution of the
population according to age. Information is included by sex
and age group (0-14 years, 15-64 years, 65 years and over).
The age structure of a population affects a nation's key
socioeconomic issues. Countries with young populations (high
percentage under age 15) need to invest more in schools,
while countries with older populations (high percentage ages
65 and over) need to invest more in the health sector. The
age structure can also be used to help predict potential
political issues. For example, the rapid growth of a young
adult population unable to find employment can lead to
unrest.

Agriculture--products: This entry is a rank ordering of major
crops and products starting with the most important.

Airports: This entry gives the total number of airports. The
runway(s) may be paved (concrete or asphalt surfaces) or
unpaved (grass, dirt, sand, or gravel surfaces), but must be
usable. Not all airports have facilities for refueling,
maintenance, or air traffic control.

Airports--with paved runways: This entry gives the total
number of airports with paved runways (concrete or asphalt
surfaces). For airports with more than one runway, only the
longest runway is included according to the following five
groups --(1) over 3,047 m, (2) 2,438 to 3,047 m, (3) 1,524 to
2,437 m, (4) 914 to 1,523 m, and (5) under 914 m. Only
airports with usable runways are included in this listing.
Not all airports have facilities for refueling, maintenance,
or air traffic control.

Airports--with unpaved runways: This entry gives the total
number of airports with unpaved runways (grass, dirt, sand,
or gravel surfaces). For airports with more than one runway,
only the longest runway is included according to the
following five groups--(1) over 3,047 m, (2) 2,438 to 3,047
m, (3) 1,524 to 2,437 m, (4) 914 to 1,523 m, and (5) under
914 m. Only airports with usable runways are included in
this listing. Not all airports have facilities for
refueling, maintenance, or air traffic control.

Appendixes: This section includes Factbook-related material
by topic.

Area: This entry includes three subfields. Total area is the
sum of all land and water areas delimited by international
boundaries and/or coastlines. Land area is the aggregate of
all surfaces delimited by international boundaries and/or
coastlines, excluding inland water bodies (lakes,
reservoirs, rivers). Water area is the sum of all water
surfaces delimited by international boundaries and/or
coastlines, including inland water bodies (lakes,
reservoirs, rivers).

Area--comparative: This entry provides an area comparison
based on total area equivalents. Most entities are compared
with the entire US or one of the 50 states based on area
measurements (1990 revised) provided by the US Bureau of the
Census. The smaller entities are compared with Washington,
DC (178 sq km, 69 sq mi) or The Mall in Washington, DC (0.59
sq km, 0.23 sq mi, 146 acres).

Background: This entry usually highlights major historic
events, current issues, and may include a statement about
one or two key future trends. This entry appears for only a
few countries at the present time, but will be added to all
countries in the future.

Birth rate: This entry gives the average annual number of
births during a year per 1,000 persons in the population at
midyear; also known as crude birth rate. The birth rate is
usually the dominant factor in determining the rate of
population growth. It depends on both the level of fertility
and the age structure of the population.

Budget: This entry includes revenues, total expenditures,
and capital expenditures. These figures are calculated on an
exchange rate basis, i.e., not in purchasing power parity
(PPP) terms.

Capital: This entry gives the location of the seat of
government.

Climate: This entry includes a brief description of typical
weather regimes throughout the year.

Coastline: This entry gives the total length of the boundary
between the land area (including islands) and the sea.

Communications: This category deals with the means of
exchanging information and includes the telephone, radio,
and television entries.

Communications--note: This entry includes miscellaneous
communications information of significance not included
elsewhere.

Constitution: This entry includes the dates of adoption,
revisions, and major amendments.

Country map: Most versions of the Factbook provide a country
map in color. The maps were produced from the best
information available at the time of preparation. Names
and/or boundaries may have changed subsequently.

Country name: This entry includes all forms of the country's
name approved by the US Board on Geographic Names (Italy is
used as an example): conventional long form (Italian
Republic), conventional short form (Italy), local long form
(Repubblica Italiana), local short form (Italia), former
(Kingdom of Italy), as well as the abbreviation. Also see
the Terminology note.

Currency: This entry identifies the national medium of
exchange and its basic subunit.

Data code: This entry gives the official US Government
digraph that precisely identifies every land entity without
overlap, duplication, or omission. AF, for example, is the
data code for Afghanistan. This two-letter country code is a
standardized geopolitical data element promulgated in the
Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS)
10-4 by the National Institute of Standards and Technology
at the US Department of Commerce and maintained by the
Office of the Geographer and Global Issues at the US
Department of State. The data code is used to eliminate
confusion and incompatibility in the collection, processing,
and dissemination of area-specific data and is particularly
useful for interchanging data between databases. Appendix F
cross-references various country data codes and Appendix G
does the same thing for hydrographic data codes.

Data codes--country: This information is presented in
Appendix F: Cross-Reference List of Country Data Codes which
includes the US Government approved Federal Information
Processing Standards (FIPS) codes, the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO) codes, and Internet
codes for land entities.

Data codes--hydrographic: This information is presented in
Appendix G: Cross-Reference List of Hydrographic Data Codes
which includes the International Hydrographic Organization
(IHO) codes, Aeronautical Chart and Information Center
(ACIC; now National Imagery and Mapping Agency or NIMA)
codes, and Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) codes for
hydrographic entities. The US Government has not yet
approved a standard for hydrographic data codes similar to
the FIPS 10-4 standard for country data codes.

Date of information: In general, information available as of
1 January 1999, was used in the preparation of this edition.

Death rate: This entry gives the average annual number of
deaths during a year per 1,000 population at midyear; also
known as crude death rate. The death rate, while only a
rough indicator of the mortality situation in a country,
accurately indicates the current mortality impact on
population growth. This indicator is significantly affected
by age distribution, and most countries will eventually show
a rise in the overall death rate, in spite of continued
decline in mortality at all ages, as declining fertility
results in an aging population.

Debt--external: This entry gives the total amount of public
foreign financial obligations.

Dependency status: This entry describes the formal
relationship between a particular nonindependent entity and
an independent state.

Dependent areas: This entry contains an alphabetical listing
of all nonindependent entities associated in some way with a
particular independent state.

Diplomatic representation: The US Government has diplomatic
relations with 184 independent states, including 178 of the
185 UN members (excluded UN members are Bhutan, Cuba, Iran,
Iraq, North Korea, former Yugoslavia, and the US itself). In
addition, the US has diplomatic relations with 6 independent
states that are not in the UN--Holy See, Kiribati, Nauru,
Switzerland, Tonga, and Tuvalu.

Diplomatic representation from the US: This entry includes
the chief of mission, embassy address, mailing address,
telephone number, FAX number, branch office locations,
consulate general locations, and consulate locations.

Diplomatic representation in the US: This entry includes the
chief of the foreign mission, chancery address, telephone
number, FAX number, consulate general locations, consulate
locations, honorary consulate general locations, and
honorary consulate locations.

Disputes--international: This entry includes a wide variety
of situations that range from traditional bilateral boundary
disputes to unilateral claims of one sort or another.
Information regarding disputes over international
terrestrial and maritime boundaries has been reviewed by the
US Department of State. References to other situations
involving borders or frontiers may also be included, such as
resource disputes, geopolitical questions, or irredentist
issues; however, inclusion does not necessarily constitute
official acceptance or recognition by the US Government.

Economic aid--donor: This entry refers to net official
development assistance (ODA) from OECD nations to developing
countries and multilateral organizations. ODA is defined as
financial assistance that is concessional in character, has
the main objective to promote economic development and
welfare of LDCs, and contains a grant element of at least
25%. The entry does not cover other official flows (OOF) or
private flows.

Economic aid--recipient: This entry, which is subject to
major problems of definition and statistical coverage,
refers to the net inflow of Official Development Finance
(ODF) to recipient countries. The figure includes assistance
from the World Bank, the IMF, and other international
organizations and from individual nation donors. Formal
commitments of aid are included in the data. Omitted from
the data are grants by private organizations. Aid comes in
various forms including outright grants and loans. The entry
thus is the difference between new inflows and repayments.

Economy: This category includes the entries dealing with the
size, development, and management of productive resources,
i.e., land, labor, and capital.

Economy--overview: This entry briefly describes the type of
economy, including the degree of market orientation, the
level of economic development, the most important natural
resources, and the unique areas of specialization. It also
characterizes major economic events and policy changes in
the most recent 12 months and may include a statement about
one or two key future macroeconomic trends.

Electricity--consumption: This entry consists of total
electricity generated annually plus imports and minus
exports, expressed in kilowatt hours.

Electricity--exports: This entry is the total exported
electricity in kilowatt hours.

Electricity--imports: This entry is the total imported
electricity in kilowatt hours.

Electricity--production: This entry is the annual electricity
generated expressed in kilowatt hours.

Electricity--production by source: This entry indicates the
percentage share of annual electricity production of each
energy source. These are fossil fuel, hydro, nuclear, and
other (solar, geothermal, and wind).

Elevation extremes: This entry includes both the highest
point and the lowest point.

Entities: Some of the independent states, dependencies,
areas of special sovereignty, and governments included in
this publication are not independent, and others are not
officially recognized by the US Government. "Independent
state" refers to a people politically organized into a
sovereign state with a definite territory. "Dependencies"
and "areas of special sovereignty" refer to a broad category
of political entities that are associated in some way with
an independent state. "Country" names used in the table of
contents or for page headings are usually the short-form
names as approved by the US Board on Geographic Names and
may include independent states, dependencies, and areas of
special sovereignty, or other geographic entities. There are
a total of 266 separate geographic entities in The World
Factbook that may be categorized as follows:

Environment--current issues: This entry lists the most
pressing and important environmental problems.

Environment--international agreements: This entry separates
country participation in international environmental
agreements into two levels--party to and signed but not
ratified. Agreements are listed in alphabetical order by the
abbreviated form of the full name.

Environmental agreements: This information is presented in
Appendix D: Selected International Environmental Agreements,
which includes the name, abbreviation, date opened for
signature, date entered into force, objective, and parties
by category.

Ethnic groups: This entry provides a rank ordering of ethnic
groups starting with the largest and normally includes the
percent of total population.

Exchange rates: This entry provides the official value of a
country's monetary unit at a given date or over a given
period of time, as expressed in units of local currency per
US dollar and as determined by international market forces
or official fiat.

Executive branch: This entry includes several subfields.
Chief of state includes the name and title of the titular
leader of the country who represents the state at official
and ceremonial functions but may not be involved with the
day-to-day activities of the government. Head of government
includes the name and title of the top administrative leader
who is designated to manage the day-to-day activities of the
government. Cabinet includes the official name for this body
of high-ranking advisers and the method for selection of
members. Elections includes the nature of election process
or accession to power, date of the last election, and date
of the next election. Election results includes the percent
of vote for each candidate in the last election. In the UK,
the monarch is the chief of state, and the prime minister is
the head of government. In the US, the president is both the
chief of state and the head of government.

Exports: This entry provides the total US dollar amount of
exports on an f.o.b. (free on board) basis.

Exports--commodities: This entry provides a rank ordering of
exported products starting with the most important; it
sometimes includes the percent of total dollar value.

Exports--partners: This entry provides a rank ordering of
trading partners starting with the most important; it
sometimes includes the percent of total dollar value.

Fiscal year: This entry identifies the beginning and ending
months for a country's accounting period of 12 months, which
often is the calendar year but which may begin in any month.
FY93/94 refers to the fiscal year that began in calendar
year 1993 and ended in calendar year 1994. All yearly
references are for the calendar year (CY) unless indicated
as a noncalendar fiscal year (FY).

Flag description: This entry provides a written flag
description produced from actual flags or the best
information available at the time the entry was written. The
flags of independent states are used by their dependencies
unless there is an officially recognized local flag. Some
disputed and other areas do not have flags.

Flag graphic: Most versions of the Factbook include a color
flag at the beginning of the country profile. The flag
graphics were produced from actual flags or the best
information available at the time of preparation. The flags
of independent states are used by their dependencies unless
there is an officially recognized local flag. Some disputed
and other areas do not have flags.

GDP: This entry gives the gross domestic product (GDP) or
value of all final goods and services produced within a
nation in a given year. GDP dollar estimates in the Factbook
are derived from purchasing power parity (PPP) calculations.
See the note on GDP methodology for more information.

GDP methodology: In the Economy section, GDP dollar
estimates for all countries are derived from purchasing
power parity (PPP) calculations rather than from conversions
at official currency exchange rates. The PPP method involves
the use of standardized international dollar price weights,
which are applied to the quantities of final goods and
services produced in a given economy. The data derived from
the PPP method provide the best available starting point for
comparisons of economic strength and well-being between
countries. The division of a GDP estimate in domestic
currency by the corresponding PPP estimate in dollars gives
the PPP conversion rate. Whereas PPP estimates for OECD
countries are quite reliable, PPP estimates for developing
countries are often rough approximations. Most of the GDP
estimates are based on extrapolation of PPP numbers
published by the UN International Comparison Program (UNICP)
and by Professors Robert Summers and Alan Heston of the
University of Pennsylvania and their colleagues. In
contrast, currency exchange rates depend on a variety of
international and domestic financial forces that often have
little relation to domestic output. In developing countries
with weak currencies the exchange rate estimate of GDP in
dollars is typically one-fourth to one-half the PPP
estimate. Furthermore, exchange rates may suddenly go up or
down by 10% or more because of market forces or official
fiat whereas real output has remained unchanged. On 12
January 1994, for example, the 14 countries of the African
Financial Community (whose currencies are tied to the French
franc) devalued their currencies by 50%. This move, of
course, did not cut the real output of these countries by
half. One important caution: the proportion of, say, defense
expenditures as a percentage of GDP in local currency
accounts may differ substantially from the proportion when
GDP accounts are expressed in PPP terms, as, for example,
when an observer tries to estimate the dollar level of
Russian or Japanese military expenditures. Note: the numbers
for GDP and other economic data can not be chained together
from successive volumes of the Factbook because of changes
in the US dollar measuring rod, revisions of data by
statistical agencies, use of new or different sources of
information, and changes in national statistical methods and
practices. For statistical series on GDP and other economic
variables, see the Handbook of International Economic
Statistics available from the same sources as The World
Factbook.

GDP--composition by sector: This entry gives the percentage
contribution of agriculture, industry, and services to total
GDP.

GDP--per capita: This entry shows GDP on a purchasing power
parity basis divided by population as of 1 July for the same
year.

GDP--real growth rate: This entry gives GDP growth on an
annual basis adjusted for inflation and expressed as a
percent.

Geographic coordinates: This entry includes rounded latitude
and longitude figures for the purpose of finding the
approximate geographic center of an entity and is based on
the Gazetteer of Conventional Names, Third Edition, August
1988, US Board on Geographic Names and on other sources.

Geographic names: This information is presented in Appendix
H: Cross-Reference List of Geographic Names which indicates
where various geographic names--including alternate names,
former names, political or geographical portions of larger
entities, and the location of all US Foreign Service
posts--can be found in The World Factbook. Spellings are
normally, but not always, those approved by the US Board on
Geographic Names (BGN). Alternate names are included in
parentheses, while additional information is included in
brackets.

Geography: This category includes the entries dealing with
the natural environment and the effects of human activity.

Geography--note: This entry includes miscellaneous geographic
information of significance not included elsewhere.

GNP: Gross national product (GNP) is the value of all final
goods and services produced within a nation in a given year,
plus income earned by its citizens abroad, minus income
earned by foreigners from domestic production. The Factbook,
following current practice, uses GDP rather than GNP to
measure national production. However, the user must realize
that in certain countries net remittances from citizens
working abroad may be important to national well-being.

Government: This category includes the entries dealing with
the system for the adoption and administration of public
policy.

Government type: This entry gives the basic form of
government (e.g., republic, constitutional monarchy, federal
republic, parliamentary democracy, military dictatorship).

Government--note: This entry includes miscellaneous
government information of significance not included
elsewhere.

Gross domestic product: see GDP

Gross national product: see GNP

Gross world product: see GWP

GWP: This entry gives the gross world product (GWP) or
aggregate value of all final goods and services produced
worldwide in a given year.

Heliports: This entry gives the total number of established
helicopter takeoff and landing sites (which may or may not
have fuel or other services).

Highways: This entry includes the total length of the
highway system as well as the length of the paved and
unpaved components.

Household income or consumption by percentage share: Data on
household income or consumption come from household surveys,
the results adjusted for household size. Nations use
different standards and procedures in collecting and
adjusting the data. Surveys based on income will normally
show a more unequal distribution than surveys based on
consumption. The quality of surveys is improving with time,
yet caution is still necessary in making inter-country
comparisons.

Illicit drugs: This entry gives information on the five
categories of illicit drugs--narcotics, stimulants,
depressants (sedatives), hallucinogens, and cannabis. These
categories include many drugs legally produced and
prescribed by doctors as well as those illegally produced
and sold outside of medical channels.

tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, Marinol), hashish (hash), and
hashish oil (hash oil).

Coca (mostly Erythroxylum coca) is a bush with leaves that
contain the stimulant used to make cocaine. Coca is not to
be confused with cocoa, which comes from cacao seeds and is
used in making chocolate, cocoa, and cocoa butter.

Cocaine is a stimulant derived from the leaves of the coca
bush.

Mandrax is a trade name for methaqualone, a pharmaceutical
depressant.

Marijuana is the dried leaves of the cannabis or hemp plant
(Cannabis sativa).

Methaqualone is a pharmaceutical depressant, referred to as
mandrax in Southwest Asia.

Narcotics are drugs that relieve pain, often induce sleep,
and refer to opium, opium derivatives, and synthetic
substitutes. Natural narcotics include opium (paregoric,
parepectolin), morphine (MS-Contin, Roxanol), codeine
(Tylenol with codeine, Empirin with codeine, Robitussan AC),
and thebaine. Semisynthetic narcotics include heroin (horse,
smack), and hydromorphone (Dilaudid). Synthetic narcotics
include meperidine or Pethidine (Demerol, Mepergan),
methadone (Dolophine, Methadose), and others (Darvon,
Lomotil).

Opium is the brown, gummy exudate of the incised, unripe
seedpod of the opium poppy.

Opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) is the source for the
natural and semisynthetic narcotics.

Poppy straw concentrate is the alkaloid derived from the
mature, dried opium poppy.

Qat (kat, khat) is a stimulant from the buds or leaves of
Catha edulis that is chewed or drunk as tea.

Quaaludes is the North American slang term for methaqualone,
a pharmaceutical depressant.

Stimulants are drugs that relieve mild depression, increase
energy and activity, and include cocaine (coke, snow,
crack), amphetamines (Desoxyn, Dexedrine), phenmetrazine
(Preludin), methylphenidate (Ritalin), and others (Cylert,
Sanorex, Tenuate).

Imports: This entry provides the total US dollar amount of
imports on a c.i.f. (cost, insurance, and freight)or f.o.b.
(free on board) basis.

Imports--commodities: This entry provides a rank ordering of
imported products starting with the most important; it
sometimes includes the percent of total dollar value.

Imports--partners: This entry provides a rank ordering of
trading partners starting with the most important; it
sometimes includes the percent of total dollar value.

Independence: For most countries, this entry gives the date
that sovereignty was achieved, and from which nation,
empire, or trusteeship. For the other countries, the date
given may not represent "independence" in the strict sense,
but rather some significant nationhood event such as
traditional founding date, date of unification, federation,
confederation, establishment, fundamental change in the form
of government, or state succession. Dependent areas include
the notation "none" followed by the nature of their
dependency status. Also see the Terminology note.

Industrial production growth rate: This entry gives the
annual percentage increase in industrial production
(includes manufacturing, mining, and construction).

Industries: This entry provides a rank ordering of
industries starting with the largest by value of annual
output.

Infant mortality rate: This entry gives the number of deaths
of infants under one year old in a given year per 1,000 live
births in the same year. This rate is often used an
indicator of the level of health in a country.

Inflation rate (consumer prices): This entry furnishes the
annual percent change in consumer prices compared with the
previous year's consumer prices.

International disputes: see Disputes--international

International organization participation: This entry lists
in alphabetical order by abbreviation those international
organizations in which the subject country is a member or
participates in some other way.

International organizations: This information is presented
in Appendix C: International Organizations and Groups which
includes the name, abbreviation, address, telephone, FAX,
date established, aim, and members by category.

Introduction: This category includes one entry, Background.
At present it appears in only a few country profiles, but
will be added to others in the future.

Irrigated land: This entry gives the number of square
kilometers of land area that is artificially supplied with
water.

Judicial branch: This entry contains the name(s) of the
highest court(s) and a brief description of the selection
process for members.

Labor force: This entry contains the total labor force
figure.

Labor force--by occupation: This entry contains a rank
ordering of component parts of the labor force by
occupation.

Land boundaries: This entry contains the total length of all
land boundaries and the individual lengths for each of the
contiguous border countries.

Land use: This entry contains the percentage shares of total
land area for five different types of land use. Arable
land--land cultivated for crops that are replanted after each
harvest like wheat, maize, and rice. Permanent crops--land
cultivated for crops that are not replanted after each
harvest like citrus, coffee, and rubber. Permanent
pastures--land permanently used for herbaceous forage crops.
Forests and woodland--land under dense or open stands of
trees. Other--any land type not specifically mentioned above,
such as urban areas, roads, desert, etc.

Languages: This entry provides a rank ordering of languages
starting with the largest and sometimes includes the percent
of total population speaking that language.

Legal system: This entry contains a brief description of the
legal system's historical roots, role in government, and
acceptance of International Court of Justice (ICJ)
jurisdiction.

Legislative branch: This entry contains information on the
structure (unicameral, bicameral, tricameral), formal name,
number of seats, and term of office. Elections includes the
nature of election process or accession to power, date of
the last election, and date of the next election. Election
results includes the percent of vote and/or number of seats
held by each party in the last election.

Life expectancy at birth: This entry contains the average
number of years to be lived by a group of people born in the
same year, if mortality at each age remains constant in the
future. The entry includes total population as well as the
male and female components. Life expectancy at birth is also
a measure of overall quality of life in a country and
summarizes the mortality at all ages. It can also be thought
of as indicating the potential return on investment in human
capital and is necessary for the calculation of various
actuarial measures.

Literacy: This entry includes a definition of literacy and
Census Bureau percentages for the total population, males,
and females. There are no universal definitions and
standards of literacy. Unless otherwise specified, all rates
are based on the most common definition--the ability to read
and write at a specified age. Detailing the standards that
individual countries use to assess the ability to read and
write is beyond the scope of the Factbook. Information on
literacy, while not a perfect measure of educational
results, is probably the most easily available and valid for
international comparisons. Low levels of literacy, and
education in general, can impede the economic development of
a country in the current rapidly changing, technology-driven
world.

Location: This entry identifies the country's regional
location, neighboring countries, and adjacent bodies of
water.

Map references: This entry includes the name of the Factbook
reference map on which a country may be found. The entry on
Geographic coordinates may be helpful in finding some
smaller countries.

Maritime claims: This entry includes the following claims:
contiguous zone, continental shelf, exclusive economic zone,
exclusive fishing zone, extended fishing zone, none (usually
for a landlocked country), other (unique maritime claims
like Libya's Gulf of Sidra Closing Line or North Korea's
Military Boundary Line), and territorial sea. The proximity
of neighboring states may prevent some national claims from
being extended the full distance.

Merchant marine: Merchant marine may be defined as all ships
engaged in the carriage of goods; all commercial vessels (as
opposed to all nonmilitary ships), which excludes tugs,
fishing vessels, offshore oil rigs, etc.; or a grouping of
merchant ships by nationality or register. This entry
contains information in two subfields--total and ships by
type. Total includes the total number of ships (1,000 GRT or
over), total DWT for those ships, and total GRT for those
ships. Ships by type includes a listing of barge carriers,
bulk cargo ships, cargo ships, combination bulk carriers,
combination ore/oil carriers, container ships, intermodal
ships, liquefied gas tankers, livestock carriers,
multifunction large--load carriers, oil tankers, passenger
ships, passenger-cargo ships, railcar carriers, refrigerated
cargo ships, roll-on/roll-off cargo ships, short-sea
passenger ships, specialized tankers, tanker tug-barges, and
vehicle carriers.

A captive register is a register of ships maintained by a
territory, possession, or colony primarily or exclusively
for the use of ships owned in the parent country; it is also
referred to as an offshore register, the offshore equivalent
of an internal register. Ships on a captive register will
fly the same flag as the parent country, or a local variant
of it, but will be subject to the maritime laws and taxation
rules of the offshore territory. Although the nature of a
captive register makes it especially desirable for ships
owned in the parent country, just as in the internal
register, the ships may also be owned abroad. The captive
register then acts as a flag of convenience register, except
that it is not the register of an independent state.

A flag of convenience register is a national register
offering registration to a merchant ship not owned in the
flag state. The major flags of convenience (FOC) attract
ships to their registers by virtue of low fees, low or
nonexistent taxation of profits, and liberal manning
requirements. True FOC registers are characterized by having
relatively few of the registered ships actually owned in the
flag state. Thus, while virtually any flag can be used for
ships under a given set of circumstances, an FOC register is
one where the majority of the merchant fleet is owned
abroad. It is also referred to as an open register.

A flag state is the nation in which a ship is registered and
which holds legal jurisdiction over operation of the ship,
whether at home or abroad. Maritime legislation of the flag
state determines how a ship is crewed and taxed and whether
a foreign-owned ship may be placed on the register. An
internal register is a register of ships maintained as a
subset of a national register. Ships on the internal
register fly the national flag and have that nationality but
are subject to a separate set of maritime rules from those
on the main national register. These differences usually
include lower taxation of profits, use of foreign nationals
as crew members, and, usually, ownership outside the flag
state (when it functions as an FOC register). The Norwegian
International Ship Register and Danish International Ship
Register are the most notable examples of an internal
register. Both have been instrumental in stemming flight
from the national flag to flags of convenience and in
attracting foreign-owned ships to the Norwegian and Danish
flags.

A merchant ship is a vessel that carries goods against
payment of freight; it is commonly used to denote any
nonmilitary ship but accurately restricted to commercial
vessels only.

A register is the record of a ship's ownership and
nationality as listed with the maritime authorities of a
country; also, it is the compendium of such individual
ships' registrations. Registration of a ship provides it
with a nationality and makes it subject to the laws of the
country in which registered (the flag state) regardless of
the nationality of the ship's ultimate owner.

Military: This category includes the entries dealing with a
country's military structure, manpower, and expenditures.

Military branches: This entry lists the names of the ground,
naval, air, marine, and other defense or security forces.

Military expenditures--dollar figure: This entry gives
current military expenditures in US dollars; the figure is
calculated by multiplying the estimated defense spending in
percentage terms by the gross domestic product (GDP)
calculated on an exchange rate basis not purchasing power
parity (PPP) terms. The figure should be treated with
caution because of different price patterns and accounting
methods among nations, as well as wide variations in the
strength of their currencies.

Military expenditures--percent of GDP: This entry gives
current military expenditures as an estimated percent of
gross domestic product (GDP).

Military manpower--availability: This entry gives the total
numbers of males and females age 15-49 and assumes that
every individual is fit to serve.

Military manpower--fit for military service: This entry gives
the number of males and females age 15-49 fit for military
service. This is a more refined measure of potential
military manpower availability which tries to correct for
the health situation in the country and reduces the maximum
potential number to a more realistic estimate of the actual
number fit to serve.

Military manpower--military age: This entry gives the minimum
age at which an individual may volunteer for military
service or be subject to conscription.

Military manpower--reaching military age annually: This entry
gives the number of draft-age males and females entering the
military manpower pool in any given year and is a measure of
the availability of draft-age young adults.

Military--note: This entry includes miscellaneous military
information of significance not included elsewhere.

Money figures: All money figures are expressed in
contemporaneous US dollars unless otherwise indicated.

National holiday: This entry gives the primary national day
of celebration--usually independence day.

Nationality: This entry provides the identifying terms for
citizens--noun and adjective.

Natural hazards: This entry lists potential natural
disasters.

Natural resources: This entry lists a country's mineral,
petroleum, hydropower, and other resources of commercial
importance.

Net migration rate: This entry includes the figure for the
difference between the number of persons entering and
leaving a country during the year per 1,000 persons (based
on midyear population). An excess of persons entering the
country is referred to as net immigration (e.g., 3.56
migrants/1,000 population); an excess of persons leaving the
country as net emigration (e.g., -9.26 migrants/1,000
population). The net migration rate indicates the
contribution of migration to the overall level of population
change. High levels of migration can cause problems such as
increasing unemployment and potential ethnic strife (if
people are coming in) or a reduction in the labor force,
perhaps in certain key sectors (if people are leaving).

People: This category includes the entries dealing with the
characteristics of the people and their society.

People--note: This entry includes miscellaneous demographic
information of significance not included elsewhere.

Personal Names--Capitalization: The Factbook capitalizes the
surname or family name of individuals for the convenience of
our users who are faced with a world of different cultures
and naming conventions. An example would be President SADDAM
Husayn of Iraq. Saddam is his name and Husayn is his
father's name. He may be referred to as President SADDAM
Husayn or President SADDAM, but not President Husayn. The
need for capitalization, bold type, underlining, italics, or
some other indicator of the individual's surname is apparent
in the following examples: MAO Zedong, Fidel CASTRO Ruz,
William Jefferson CLINTON, and TUNKU SALAHUDDIN Abdul Aziz
Shah ibni Al-Marhum Sultan Hisammuddin Alam Shah. By knowing
the surname, a short form without all capital letters can be
used with confidence as in President Saddam, President
Castro, Chairman Mao, President Clinton, or Sultan Tunku
Salahuddin. The same system of capitalization is extended to
the names of leaders with surnames that are not commonly
used such as Queen ELIZABETH II.

Personal Names--Spelling: The romanization of personal names
in the Factbook normally follows the same transliteration
system used by the US Board on Geographic Names for spelling
place names. At times, however, a foreign leader expressly
indicates a preference for, or the media or official
documents regularly use, a romanized spelling that differs
from the transliteration derived from the US Government
standard. In such cases, the Factbook uses the alternative
spelling.

Personal Names--Titles: The Factbook capitalizes any valid
title (or short form of it) immediately preceding a person's
name. A title standing alone is lowercased. Examples:
President YEL'TSIN and President CLINTON are chiefs of
state. In Russia, the president is chief of state and the
premier is the head of the government, while in the US, the
president is both chief of state and head of government.

Pipelines: This entry gives the lengths and types of
pipelines for transporting products like natural gas, crude
oil, or petroleum products.

Political parties and leaders: This entry includes a listing
of significant political organizations and their leaders.

Political pressure groups and leaders: This entry includes a
listing of organizations with leaders involved in politics,
but not standing for legislative election.

Population: This entry gives an estimate from the US Bureau
of the Census based on statistics from population censuses,
vital statistics registration systems, or sample surveys
pertaining to the recent past and on assumptions about
future trends. The total population presents one overall
measure of the potential impact of the country on the world
and within its region. Note: starting with the 1993
Factbook, demographic estimates for some countries (mostly
African) have taken into account the effects of the growing
incidence of AIDS infections. These countries are Botswana,
Brazil, Burkina Faso, Burma, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon,
Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo,
Republic of the Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Guyana,
Haiti, Honduras, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia, Nigeria,
Rwanda, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Thailand, Uganda,
Zambia, and Zimbabwe.

Population below poverty line: National estimates of the
percentage of the population lying below the poverty line
are based on surveys of sub-groups, with the results
weighted by the number of people in each group. Definitions
of poverty vary considerably among nations. For example,
rich nations generally employ more generous standards of
poverty than poor nations.

Population growth rate: The average annual percent change in
the population, resulting from a surplus (or deficit) of
births over deaths and the balance of migrants entering and
leaving a country. The rate may be positive or negative. The
growth rate is a factor in determining how great a burden
would be imposed on a country by the changing needs of its
people for infrastructure (e.g., schools, hospitals,
housing, roads), resources (e.g., food, water, electricity),
and jobs. Rapid population growth can be seen as threatening
by neighboring countries.

Ports and harbors: This entry lists the major ports and
harbors selected on the basis of overall importance to each
country. This is determined by evaluating a number of
factors (e.g., dollar value of goods handled, gross tonnage,
facilities, military significance).

Radio broadcast stations: This entry includes the total
number of AM, FM, and shortwave broadcast stations.

Radios: This entry gives the total number of radio
receivers.

Railways: This entry includes the total length of the
railway network and component parts by gauge: broad, dual,
narrow, standard, and other.

Reference maps: This section includes world, regional, and
special or current interest maps.

Religions: This entry includes a rank ordering of religions
starting with the largest and sometimes includes the percent
of total population.

Sex ratio: This entry includes the number of males for each
female in five age groups--at birth, under 15 years, 15-64
years, 65 years and over, and for the total population. Sex
ratio at birth has recently emerged as an indicator of
certain kinds of sex discrimination in some countries. For
instance, high sex ratios at birth in some Asian countries
are now attributed to sex-selective abortion and infanticide
due to a strong preference for sons. This will affect future
marriage patterns and fertility patterns. Eventually it
could cause unrest among young adult males who are unable to
find partners. The sex ratio at birth for the World is 1.06
(1999 est.).

Suffrage: This entry gives the age at enfranchisement and
whether the right to vote is universal or restricted.

Telephone numbers: All telephone numbers in the Factbook
consist of the country code in brackets, the city or area
code (where required) in parentheses, and the local number.
The one component that is not presented is the international
access code, which varies from country to country. For
example, an international direct dial telephone call placed
from the US to Madrid, Spain, would be as follows:

011 [34] (1) 577-xxxx where

011 is the international access code for station-to-station
calls

(01 is for calls other than station-to-station calls),

[34] is the country code for Spain,

(1) is the city code for Madrid,

577 is the local exchange, and

xxxx is the local telephone number.

An international direct dial telephone call placed from
another country to the US would be as follows:

international access code + [1] (202) 939-xxxx, where

[1] is the country code for the US,

(202) is the area code for Washington, DC,

939 is the local exchange, and

xxxx is the local telephone number.

characterization of the system with details on the domestic
and international components. The following terms and
abbreviations are used throughout the entry:

Arabsat--Arab Satellite Communications Organization (Riyadh,
Saudi Arabia).

Autodin--Automatic Digital Network (US Department of

1970 by the Arab Telecommunications Union (ATU) and was
known at that time as the Middle East Mediterranean
Telecommunications Network.

microwave radio relay--transmission of long distance
telephone calls and television programs by highly
directional radio microwaves that are received and sent on
from one booster station to another on an optical path.

NMT--Nordic Mobile Telephone; an analog cellular telephone

Telephones: This entry gives the total number of
subscribers.

Television--broadcast stations: This entry gives the total
number of separate broadcast stations plus any repeater
stations.

Televisions: This entry gives the total number of television
sets.

Terminology: Due to the highly structured nature of the
Factbook database, some collective generic terms have to be
used. For example, the word Country in the Country name
entry refers to a wide variety of dependencies, areas of
special sovereignty, uninhabited islands, and other entities
in addition to the traditional countries or independent
states. Military is also used as an umbrella term for
various civil defense, security, and defense activities in
many entries. The Independence entry includes the usual
colonial independence dates and former ruling states as well
as other significant nationhood dates such as the
traditional founding date or the date of unification,
federation, confederation, establishment, or state
succession that are not strictly independence dates.
Dependent areas have the nature of their dependency status
noted in this same entry.

Terrain: This entry contains a brief description of the
topography.

Total fertility rate: This entry gives a figure for the
average number of children that would be born per woman if
all women lived to the end of their childbearing years and
bore children according to a given fertility rate at each
age. The total fertility rate is a more direct measure of
the level of fertility than the crude birth rate, since it
refers to births per woman. This indicator shows the
potential for population growth in the country. High rates
will also place some limits on the labor force participation
rates for women. Large numbers of children born to women
indicate large family sizes that might limit the ability of
the families to feed and educate their children.

Transnational Issues: This category includes only two
entries at the present time --Disputes--international and
Illicit drugs--that deal with current issues going beyond
national boundaries.

Transportation: This category includes the entries dealing
with the means for movement of people and goods.

Transportation--note: This entry includes miscellaneous
transportation information of significance not included
elsewhere.

Unemployment rate: This entry contains the percent of the
labor force that is without jobs. Substantial
underemployment might be noted.

United Nations System: This information is presented in
Appendix B: United Nations System as a chart, table, or text
(depending on the version of the Factbook) that shows the
organization of the UN in detail.

Waterways: This entry gives the total length and individual
names of navigable rivers, canals, and other inland bodies
of water.

Weights and measures: This information is presented in
Appendix E: Weights and Measures and includes mathematical
notations (mathematical powers and names), metric
interrelationships (prefix; symbol; length, weight, or
capacity; area; volume), and standard conversion factors.

Years: All year references are for the calendar year (CY)
unless indicated as fiscal year (FY). The calendar year is
an accounting period of 12 months from 1 January to 31
December. The fiscal year is an accounting period of 12
months other than 1 January to 31 December. FY93/94 refers
to the fiscal year that began in calendar year 1993 and
ended in calendar year 1994.

Note: Information for the US and US dependencies was
compiled from material in the public domain and does not
represent Intelligence Community estimates. The Handbook of
International Economic Statistics, published annually in
September by the Central Intelligence Agency, contains
detailed economic information for the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, the
successor nations to the Soviet Union, and selected other
countries. The Handbook can be obtained wherever the
Factbook is available.

A Brief History of Basic Intelligence and The World Factbook


The Intelligence Cycle is the process by which information is acquired,
converted into intelligence, and made available to policymakers.
Information is raw data from any source, data that may be fragmentary,
contradictory, unreliable, ambiguous, deceptive, or wrong. Intelligence
is information that has been collected, integrated, evaluated,
analyzed, and interpreted. Finished intelligence is the final product
of the Intelligence Cycle ready to be delivered to the policymaker.

The three types of finished intelligence are: basic, current, and
estimative. Basic intelligence provides the fundamental and factual
reference material on a country or issue. Current intelligence reports
on new developments. Estimative intelligence judges probable outcomes.
The three are mutually supportive: basic intelligence is the foundation
on which the other two are constructed; current intelligence
continually updates the inventory of knowledge; and estimative
intelligence revises overall interpretations of country and issue
prospects for guidance of basic and current intelligence. The World
Factbook, The President's Daily Brief, and the National Intelligence
Estimates are examples of the three types of finished intelligence.

The United States has carried on foreign intelligence activities since
the days of George Washington, but only since World War II have they
been coordinated on a governmentwide basis. Three programs have
highlighted the development of coordinated basic intelligence since
that time: (1) the Joint Army Navy Intelligence Studies (JANIS), (2)
the National Intelligence Survey (NIS), and (3) The World Factbook.

During World War II, intelligence consumers realized that the
production of basic intelligence by different components of the US
Government resulted in a great duplication of effort and conflicting
information. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 brought home
to leaders in Congress and the executive branch the need for
integrating departmental reports to national policymakers. Detailed
coordinated information was needed not only on such major powers as
Germany and Japan, but also on places of little previous interest. In
the Pacific Theater, for example, the Navy and Marines had to launch
amphibious operations against many islands about which information was
unconfirmed or nonexistent. Intelligence authorities resolved that the
United States should never again be caught unprepared.

In 1943, Gen. George B. Strong (G-2), Adm. H. C. Train (Office of Naval
Intelligence--ONI), and Gen. William J. Donovan (Director of the Office
of Strategic Services--OSS) decided that a joint effort should be
initiated. A steering committee was appointed on 27 April 1943 that
recommended the formation of a Joint Intelligence Study Publishing
Board to assemble, edit, coordinate, and publish the Joint Army Navy
Intelligence Studies (JANIS). JANIS was the first interdepartmental
basic intelligence program to fulfill the needs of the US Government
for an authoritative and coordinated appraisal of strategic basic
intelligence. Between April 1943 and July 1947, the board published 34
JANIS studies. JANIS performed well in the war effort, and numerous
letters of commendation were received, including a statement from Adm.
Forrest Sherman, Chief of Staff, Pacific Ocean Areas, which said,
"JANIS has become the indispensable reference work for the shore-based
planners."

The need for more comprehensive basic intelligence in the postwar world
was well expressed in 1946 by George S. Pettee, a noted author on
national security. He wrote in The Future of American Secret
Intelligence (Infantry Journal Press, 1946, page 46) that world
leadership in peace requires even more elaborate intelligence than war.
"The conduct of peace involves all countries, all human activities--not
just the enemy and his war production."

The Central Intelligence Agency was established on 26 July 1947 and
officially began operating on 18 September 1947. Effective 1 October
1947, the Director of Central Intelligence assumed operational
responsibility for JANIS. On 13 January 1948, the National Security
Council issued Intelligence Directive (NSCID) No. 3, which authorized
the National Intelligence Survey (NIS) program as a peacetime
replacement for the wartime JANIS program. Before adequate NIS country
sections could be produced, government agencies had to develop more
comprehensive gazetteers and better maps. The US Board on Geographic
Names (BGN) compiled the names; the Department of the Interior produced
the gazetteers; and CIA produced the maps.

The Hoover Commission's Clark Committee, set up in 1954 to study the
structure and administration of the CIA, reported to Congress in 1955
that: "The National Intelligence Survey is an invaluable publication
which provides the essential elements of basic intelligence on all
areas of the world. . . . There will always be a continuing requirement
for keeping the Survey up-to-date." The Factbook was created as an
annual summary and update to the encyclopedic NIS studies. The first
classified Factbook was published in August 1962, and the first
unclassified version was published in June 1971. The NIS program was
terminated in 1973 except for the Factbook, map, and gazetteer
components. The 1975 Factbook was the first to be made available to the
public with sales through the US Government Printing Office (GPO). The
1996 edition was printed by GPO and the 1997 edition was reprinted by
GPO. The year 1999 marks the 52nd anniversary of the establishment of
the Central Intelligence Agency and the 56th year of continuous basic
intelligence support to the US Government by The World Factbook and its
two predecessor programs

Economy



Economy--overview: Afghanistan is an extremely poor, landlocked
  country, highly dependent on farming and livestock raising (sheep
  and goats). Economic considerations have played second fiddle to
  political and military upheavals during two decades of war,
  including the nearly 10-year Soviet military occupation (which ended
  15 February 1989). During that conflict one-third of the population
  fled the country, with Pakistan and Iran sheltering a combined peak
  of more than 6 million refugees. Now, only 750,000 registered Afghan
  refugees remain in Pakistan and about 1.2 million in Iran. Another 1
  million have probably moved into and around urban areas within
  Afghanistan. Gross domestic product has fallen substantially over
  the past 20 years because of the loss of labor and capital and the
  disruption of trade and transport. Much of the population continues
  to suffer from insufficient food, clothing, housing, and medical
  care. Inflation remains a serious problem throughout the country,
  with one estimate putting the rate at 240% in Kabul in 1996.
  International aid can deal with only a fraction of the humanitarian
  problem, let alone promote economic development. Government efforts
  to encourage foreign investment have not worked. The economic
  situation did not improve in 1998. Numerical data are likely to be
  either unavailable or unreliable.

Economy



Economy--overview: An extremely poor country by European
  standards, Albania is making the difficult transition to a more
  open-market economy. The economy rebounded in 1993-95 after a severe
  depression accompanying the collapse of the previous centrally
  planned system in 1990 and 1991. However, a weakening of government
  resolve to maintain stabilization policies in the election year of
  1996 contributed to renewal of inflationary pressures, spurred by
  the budget deficit which exceeded 12%. The collapse of financial
  pyramid schemes in early 1997--which had attracted deposits from a
  substantial portion of Albania's population--triggered severe social
  unrest which led to more than 1,500 deaths, widespread destruction
  of property, and an 8% drop in GDP. The new government installed in
  July 1997 has taken strong measures to restore public order and to
  revive economic activity and trade. The economy continues to be
  bolstered by remittances of some 20% of the labor force which works
  abroad, mostly in Greece and Italy. These remittances supplement GDP
  and help offset the large foreign trade deficit. Most agricultural
  land was privatized in 1992, substantially improving peasant
  incomes. In 1998, Albania probably recovered most if not all of the
  7% drop in GDP of 1997.

Economy



Economy--overview: The hydrocarbons sector is the backbone of the
  economy, accounting for roughly 52% of budget revenues, 25% of GDP,
  and over 95% of export earnings. Algeria has the fifth-largest
  reserves of natural gas in the world and is the second largest gas
  exporter; it ranks fourteenth for oil reserves. Algiers' efforts to
  reform one of the most centrally planned economies in the Arab world
  began after the 1986 collapse of world oil prices plunged the
  country into a severe recession. In 1989, the government launched a
  comprehensive, IMF-supported program to achieve economic
  stabilization and to introduce market mechanisms into the economy.
  Despite substantial progress toward economic adjustment, in 1992 the
  reform drive stalled as Algiers became embroiled in political
  turmoil. In September 1993, a new government was formed, and one
  priority was the resumption and acceleration of the structural
  adjustment process. Burdened with a heavy foreign debt, Algiers
  concluded a one-year standby arrangement with the IMF in April 1994
  and the following year signed onto a three-year extended fund
  facility which ended 30 April 1998. Progress on economic reform, a
  Paris Club debt rescheduling in 1995, and oil and gas sector
  expansion have contributed to a recovery since 1995. Investments in
  developing hydrocarbon resources have spurred growth, but the
  economy remains heavily dependent on volatile oil and gas revenues.
  The government has continued efforts to diversify the economy by
  attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector
  in order to reduce high unemployment and improve living standards.

Economy



Economy--overview: This is a traditional Polynesian economy in
  which more than 90% of the land is communally owned. Economic
  activity is strongly linked to the US, with which American Samoa
  conducts the great bulk of its foreign trade. Tuna fishing and tuna
  processing plants are the backbone of the private sector, with
  canned tuna the primary export. Transfers from the US Government add
  substantially to American Samoa's economic well-being. According to
  one observer, attempts by the government to develop a larger and
  broader economy are restrained by Samoa's remote location, its
  limited transportation, and its devastating hurricanes. Tourism, a
  developing sector, may be held back by the current financial
  difficulties in East Asia.

Economy



Economy--overview: Tourism, the mainstay of Andorra's tiny,
  well-to-do economy, accounts for roughly 80% of GDP. An estimated 10
  million tourists visit annually, attracted by Andorra's duty-free
  status and by its summer and winter resorts. Andorra's comparative
  advantage has recently eroded as the economies of neighboring France
  and Spain have been opened up, providing broader availability of
  goods and lower tariffs. The banking sector, with its "tax haven"
  status, also contributes substantially to the economy. Agricultural
  production is limited by a scarcity of arable land, and most food
  has to be imported. The principal livestock activity is sheep
  raising. Manufacturing consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars, and
  furniture. Andorra is a member of the EU Customs Union and is
  treated as an EU member for trade in manufactured goods (no tariffs)
  and as a non-EU member for agricultural products.

Economy



Economy--overview: Angola is an economy in disarray because of
  more than 20 years of nearly continuous warfare. Despite its
  abundant natural resources, output per capita is among the world's
  lowest. Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for 85%
  of the population. Oil production and the supporting activities are
  vital to the economy, contributing about 45% to GDP. Notwithstanding
  the signing of a peace accord in November 1994, sporadic violence
  continues, millions of land mines remain, and many farmers are
  reluctant to return to their fields. As a result, much of the
  country's food must still be imported. To take advantage of its rich
  resources--gold, diamonds, extensive forests, Atlantic fisheries,

Economy



Economy--overview: Anguilla has few natural resources, and the
  economy depends heavily on luxury tourism, offshore banking, lobster
  fishing, and remittances from emigrants. The economy, and especially
  the tourism sector, suffered a setback in late 1995 due to the
  effects of Hurricane Luis in September but recovered in 1996.
  Increased activity in the tourism industry, which has spurred the
  growth of the construction sector, contributed to economic growth in
  1997-98. Anguillan officials have put substantial effort into
  developing the offshore financing sector. A comprehensive package of
  financial services legislation was enacted in late 1994. In the
  medium term, prospects for the economy will depend on the tourism
  sector and, therefore, on continuing income growth in the
  industrialized nations.

Area:
  total: 14 million sq km
  land: 14 million sq km (280,000 sq km ice-free, 13.72 million sq km
  ice-covered) (est.)
  note: second-smallest continent (after Australia)

Area--comparative: slightly less than 1.5 times the size of the US

Land boundaries: 0 km
  note: see entry on International disputes

Coastline: 17,968 km

Maritime claims: none, but see entry on International disputes

Climate: severe low temperatures vary with latitude, elevation,
  and distance from the ocean; East Antarctica is colder than West
  Antarctica because of its higher elevation; Antarctic Peninsula has
  the most moderate climate; higher temperatures occur in January
  along the coast and average slightly below freezing

Terrain: about 98% thick continental ice sheet and 2% barren
  rock, with average elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters;
  mountain ranges up to about 5,000 meters; ice-free coastal areas
  include parts of southern Victoria Land, Wilkes Land, the Antarctic
  Peninsula area, and parts of Ross Island on McMurdo Sound; glaciers
  form ice shelves along about half of the coastline, and floating ice
  shelves constitute 11% of the area of the continent

Elevation extremes:
  lowest point: Indian Ocean 0 m
  highest point: Vinson Massif 5,140 m

Natural resources: none presently exploited; iron ore, chromium,
  copper, gold, nickel, platinum and other minerals, and coal and
  hydrocarbons have been found in small, uncommercial quantities

Land use:
  arable land: 0%
  permanent crops: 0%
  permanent pastures: 0%
  forests and woodland: 0%
  other: 100% (ice 98%, barren rock 2%)

Natural hazards: katabatic (gravity-driven) winds blow coastward
  from the high interior; frequent blizzards form near the foot of the
  plateau; cyclonic storms form over the ocean and move clockwise
  along the coast; volcanism on Deception Island and isolated areas of
  West Antarctica; other seismic activity rare and weak

Environment--current issues: in 1998, NASA satellite data showed
  that the antarctic ozone hole was the largest on record, covering 27
  million square kilometers; researchers in 1997 found that increased
  ultraviolet light coming through the hole damages the DNA of
  icefish, an antarctic fish lacking hemoglobin; ozone depletion
  earlier was shown to harm one-celled antarctic marine plants

Government type: Antarctic Treaty Summary--the Antarctic Treaty,
  signed on 1 December 1959 and entered into force on 23 June 1961,
  establishes the legal framework for the management of Antarctica.
  Administration is carried out through consultative member
  meetings--the 22nd Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting was in
  Norway in May 1998. At the end of 1998, there were 43 treaty member
  nations: 27 consultative and 16 acceding. Consultative (voting)
  members include the seven nations that claim portions of Antarctica
  as national territory (some claims overlap) and 20 nonclaimant
  nations. The US and some other nations that have made no claims have
  reserved the right to do so. The US does not recognize the claims of
  others. The year in parentheses indicates when an acceding nation
  was voted to full consultative (voting) status, while no date
  indicates the country was an original 1959 treaty signatory.
  Claimant nations are--Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, New
  Zealand, Norway, and the UK. Nonclaimant consultative nations
  are--Belgium, Brazil (1983), Bulgaria (1978) China (1985), Ecuador
  (1990), Finland (1989), Germany (1981), India (1983), Italy (1987),
  Japan, South Korea (1989), Netherlands (1990), Peru (1989), Poland
  (1977), Russia, South Africa, Spain (1988), Sweden (1988), Uruguay
  (1985), and the US. Acceding (nonvoting) members, with year of
  accession in parentheses, are--Austria (1987), Canada (1988),
  Colombia (1988), Cuba (1984), Czech Republic (1993), Denmark (1965),
  Greece (1987), Guatemala (1991), Hungary (1984), North Korea (1987),
  Papua New Guinea (1981), Romania (1971), Slovakia (1993),
  Switzerland (1990), Turkey (1995), and Ukraine (1992). Article
  1--area to be used for peaceful purposes only; military activity,
  such as weapons testing, is prohibited, but military personnel and
  equipment may be used for scientific research or any other peaceful
  purpose; Article 2--freedom of scientific investigation and
  cooperation shall continue; Article 3--free exchange of information
  and personnel in cooperation with the UN and other international
  agencies; Article 4--does not recognize, dispute, or establish
  territorial claims and no new claims shall be asserted while the
  treaty is in force; Article 5 --prohibits nuclear explosions or
  disposal of radioactive wastes; Article 6--includes under the treaty
  all land and ice shelves south of 60 degrees 00 minutes south;
  Article 7--treaty-state observers have free access, including aerial
  observation, to any area and may inspect all stations,
  installations, and equipment; advance notice of all activities and
  of the introduction of military personnel must be given; Article
  8--allows for jurisdiction over observers and scientists by their own
  states; Article 9--frequent consultative meetings take place among
  member nations; Article 10--treaty states will discourage activities
  by any country in Antarctica that are contrary to the treaty;
  Article 11--disputes to be settled peacefully by the parties
  concerned or, ultimately, by the ICJ; Articles 12, 13, 14--deal with
  upholding, interpreting, and amending the treaty among involved
  nations. Other agreements--some 200 recommendations adopted at treaty
  consultative meetings and ratified by governments include --Agreed
  Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora (1964);
  Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals (1972);
  Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources
  (1980); a mineral resources agreement was signed in 1988 but was
  subsequently rejected; the Protocol on Environmental Protection to
  the Antarctic Treaty was signed 4 October 1991 and entered into
  force 14 January 1998; this agreement provides for the protection of
  the Antarctic environment through five specific annexes on marine
  pollution, fauna, and flora, environmental impact assessments, waste
  management, and protected areas; it prohibits all activities
  relating to mineral resources except scientific research.

Legal system: US law, including certain criminal offenses by or
  against US nationals, such as murder, may apply to areas not under
  jurisdiction of other countries. Some US laws directly apply to
  Antarctica. For example, the Antarctic Conservation Act, 16 U.S.C.
  section 2401 et seq., provides civil and criminal penalties for the
  following activities, unless authorized by regulation of statute:
  the taking of native mammals or birds; the introduction of
  nonindigenous plants and animals; entry into specially protected or
  scientific areas; the discharge or disposal of pollutants; and the
  importation into the US of certain items from Antarctica. Violation
  of the Antarctic Conservation Act carries penalties of up to $10,000
  in fines and one year in prison. The Departments of Treasury,
  Commerce, Transportation, and Interior share enforcement
  responsibilities. Public Law 95-541, the US Antarctic Conservation
  Act of 1978, requires expeditions from the US to Antarctica to
  notify, in advance, the Office of Oceans and Polar Affairs, Room
  5801, Department of State, Washington, DC 20520, which reports such
  plans to other nations as required by the Antarctic Treaty. For more
  information, contact Permit Office, Office of Polar Programs,

Economy



Economy--overview: No economic activity is conducted at present,
  except for fishing off the coast and small-scale tourism, both based
  abroad. Antarctic fisheries in 1997-98 reported landing 92,456
  metric tons. Unregulated fishing landed five to six times more than
  the regulated fishery, and allegedly illegal fishing in antarctic
  waters in 1998 resulted in the seizure (by France and Australia) of
  at least eight fishing ships. A total of 9,604 tourists visited in
  the 1997-98 summer, up from the 7,413 who visited the previous year.
  Nearly all of them were passengers on 13 commercial
  (nongovernmental) ships that made 92 trips during the summer. Around
  200 tourists were on yachts or commercial aircraft. Most tourist
  trips lasted approximately two weeks.

Military--note: the Antarctic Treaty prohibits any measures of a
  military nature, such as the establishment of military bases and
  fortifications, the carrying out of military maneuvers, or the
  testing of any type of weapon; it permits the use of military
  personnel or equipment for scientific research or for any other
  peaceful purposes



Transnational Issues



Disputes--international: Antarctic Treaty defers claims (see
  Antarctic Treaty Summary above); sections (some overlapping) claimed
  by Argentina, Australia, Chile, France (Adelie Land), New Zealand
  (Ross Dependency), Norway (Queen Maud Land), and UK; the US and most
  other nations do not recognize the territorial claims of other
  nations and have made no claims themselves (the US reserves the
  right to do so); no formal claims have been made in the sector
  between 90 degrees west and 150 degrees west

Economy



Economy--overview: Tourism continues to be by far the dominant
  activity in the economy accounting directly or indirectly for more
  than half of GDP. Increased tourist arrivals have helped spur growth
  in the construction and transport sectors. The dual island nation's
  agricultural production is mainly directed to the domestic market;
  the sector is constrained by the limited water supply and labor
  shortages that reflect the pull of higher wages in tourism and
  construction. Manufacturing comprises enclave-type assembly for
  export with major products being bedding, handicrafts, and
  electronic components. Prospects for economic growth in the medium
  term will continue to depend on income growth in the industrialized
  world, especially in the US, which accounts for about half of all
  tourist arrivals.

@Argentina
---------





Introduction



Background: A part of the Spanish empire until independence in
  1816, Argentina subsequently experienced periods of internal
  political conflict between conservatives and liberals and between
  civilian and military factions. Meantime, thanks to rich natural
  resources and foreign investment, a modern agriculture and a
  diversified industry were gradually developed. After World War II, a
  long period of Peronist dictatorship was followed by rule by a
  military junta. Democratic elections finally came in 1983, but both
  the political and economic atmosphere remain susceptible to turmoil.

Economy



Economy--overview: Argentina benefits from rich natural resources,
  a highly literate population, an export-oriented agricultural
  sector, and a diversified industrial base. However, when President
  Carlos MENEM took office in 1989, the country had piled up huge
  external debts, inflation had reached 200% per month, and output was
  plummeting. To combat the economic crisis, the government embarked
  on a path of trade liberalization, deregulation, and privatization.
  In 1991, it implemented radical monetary reforms which pegged the
  peso to the US dollar and limited the growth in the monetary base by
  law to the growth in reserves. Inflation fell sharply in subsequent
  years. The Mexican peso crisis produced capital flight, the loss of
  banking system deposits, and a severe, but short-lived, recession in
  1995; a series of reforms to bolster the domestic banking system
  followed. Real GDP growth recovered strongly, reaching almost 9% in
  1997. In 1998, increasing investor anxiety over Brazil, its largest
  trading partner, produced the highest domestic interest rates in
  more than three years and slowed growth to 4.3%. Despite the
  relatively high level of growth in recent years, double-digit
  unemployment rates have persisted, largely because of rigidities in
  Argentina's labor laws.

Introduction



Background: Armenia was one of the 15 successor republics to the
  USSR in December 1991. Its leaders remain preoccupied by the long
  conflict with Azerbaijan over the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave. Although
  a cease-fire has been in effect since May 1994, the sides have not
  made substantial progress toward a peaceful resolution. In January
  1998, differences between President TER-PETROSSIAN and members of
  his cabinet over the Nagorno-Karabakh peace process came to a head.
  With the prime minister, defense minister, and security minister
  arrayed against him, an isolated TER-PETROSSIAN resigned the
  presidency on 3 February 1998. Prime Minister Robert KOCHARIAN was
  elected president in March 1998. Concerns about Armenia's economic
  performance have continued since 1997 with a slowdown in growth and
  the serious impact of the 1998 financial crisis in Russia.

Economy



Economy--overview: Under the old Soviet central planning system,
  Armenia had developed a modern industrial sector, supplying machine
  tools, textiles, and other manufactured goods to sister republics in
  exchange for raw materials and energy. Since the implosion of the
  USSR in December 1991, Armenia has switched to small-scale
  agriculture away from the large agroindustrial complexes of the
  Soviet area. The agricultural sector has long-term needs for more
  investment and updated technology. The privatization of industry has
  been at a slower pace, but has been given renewed emphasis by the
  current administration. Armenia is a food importer, and its mineral
  deposits (gold, bauxite) are small. The ongoing conflict with
  Azerbaijan over the ethnic Armenian-dominated region of
  Nagorno-Karabakh and the breakup of the centrally directed economic
  system of the former Soviet Union contributed to a severe economic
  decline in the early 1990s. By 1994, however, the Armenian
  Government had launched an ambitious IMF-sponsored economic program
  that has resulted in positive growth rates in 1995-98. Armenia also
  managed to slash inflation and to privatize most small- and
  medium-sized enterprises. The chronic energy shortages Armenia
  suffered in recent years have been largely offset by the energy
  supplied by one of its nuclear power plants at Metsamor. The Russian
  financial crisis generated concerns about Armenia's economic
  performance in 1998. Although inflation dropped to 10% and GDP grew
  about 6%, the industrial sector remained moribund. Much of Armenia's
  population remains heavily dependent on remittances from relatives
  abroad, and remittances from Russia fell off sharply in 1998.

Economy



Economy--overview: Tourism is the mainstay of the Aruban economy,
  although offshore banking and oil refining and storage are also
  important. The rapid growth of the tourism sector over the last
  decade has resulted in a substantial expansion of other activities.
  Construction has boomed, with hotel capacity five times the 1985
  level. In addition, the reopening of the country's oil refinery in
  1993, a major source of employment and foreign exchange earnings,
  has further spurred growth. Aruba's small labor force and less than
  1% unemployment rate have led to a large number of unfilled job
  vacancies, despite sharp rises in wage rates in recent years.

Introduction



Background: Australia became a British commonwealth in 1901.
  Blessed by rich natural resources, the country enjoyed rapid gains
  in herding, agriculture, and manufacturing and made a major
  contribution to the British effort in World Wars I and II. Australia
  subsequently developed its minerals, metals, and fossil fuel
  markets, all of which have become key Australian exports. Long-term
  concerns include pollution, particularly depletion of the ozone
  layer, and management and conservation of coastal areas, especially
  the Great Barrier Reef. Sydney will host the 2000 summer Olympics.

Economy



Economy--overview: Australia has a prosperous Western-style
  capitalist economy, with a per capita GDP at the level of the four
  dominant West European economies. Rich in natural resources,
  Australia is a major exporter of agricultural products, minerals,
  metals, and fossil fuels. Commodities account for 57% of the value
  of total exports, so that a downturn in world commodity prices can
  have a big impact on the economy. The government is pushing for
  increased exports of manufactured goods, but competition in
  international markets continues to be severe. Australia has suffered
  from the low growth and high unemployment characterizing the OECD
  countries in the early 1990s, but the economy has expanded at
  reasonably steady rates in recent years. Canberra's emphasis on
  reforms is a key factor behind the economy's resilience to the
  regional crisis and its stronger than expected growth rate that
  reached 4.5% last year. After a slow start in 1998, exports
  rebounded in the second half of the year because of a sharp currency
  depreciation and a redirection of sales to Europe, North America,
  and Latin America.

@Austria

Introduction



Background: Once the center of power for the large
  Austro-Hungarian empire, Austria was reduced to a small republic
  after its defeat in World War I. After the annexation to Nazi
  Germany in 1938 and subsequent occupation by the victorious Allied
  powers, Austria's 1955 State Treaty declared the country
  "permanently neutral" as a condition of the Soviet military
  withdrawal. The Soviet collapse relieved the external pressure to
  remain unaligned, but neutrality had evolved into a part of Austrian
  cultural identity, which has led to an ongoing public debate over
  whether Vienna legitimately can remain outside of European security
  structures. A wealthy country, Austria joined the European Union in
  1995 and, like many EU members, is adjusting to the new European
  currency and struggling with high unemployment.

Economy



Economy--overview: Austria has a well-developed market economy
  with a high standard of living. As a member of the European Monetary
  Union (EMU), Austria's economy is closely integrated with other EU
  member countries, especially with Germany. Austria's membership in
  the EU has drawn an influx of foreign investors attracted by
  Austria's access to the single European market. Through
  privatization efforts, the 1996-98 budget consolidation programs,
  and austerity measures, Austria brought its total public sector
  deficit down to 2.5% of GDP in 1997 and public debt--at 66% of GDP in
  1997--more or less in line with the 60% of GDP required by the EU's
  Maastricht criteria. Cuts mainly affect the civil service and
  Austria's generous social system, the two major causes of the
  government deficit. To meet increased competition from both EU and
  Central European countries, Austria will need to emphasize
  knowledge-based sectors of the economy and deregulate the service
  sector, particularly telecommunications and energy. The strong GDP
  growth of 1998 is expected to dwindle back to 2.3% in 1999, and
  observers caution that this projection may be revised downwards in
  view of the Asian and Brazilian crises and Germany's lower growth
  projection.

----------





Introduction



Background: In 1806, Azerbaijan, a region of Turkic Muslim
  people, was conquered by the Russians. In 1918, Azerbaijan declared
  independence from Russia, but was incorporated into the Soviet Union
  in 1920. It again declared its independence in 1991, following the
  collapse of the USSR. The conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia
  over the Nagorno-Karabakh region is still unresolved after 10 years
  and Baku has yet to settle disputes with its neighbors over oil
  rights in the Caspian Sea. During the war, Karabakh Armenians
  declared independence and seized almost 20% of the country's
  territory, creating some 750,000 Azerbaijani refugees in the
  process. Both sides have generally observed a Russian-mediated
  cease-fire in place since May 1994.

  Yasaqligi (Apsheron Peninsula) (including Baku and Sumqayit) and the
  Caspian Sea to be the ecologically most devastated area in the world
  because of severe air, water, and soil pollution; soil pollution
  results from the use of DDT as a pesticide and also from toxic
  defoliants used in the production of cotton

Economy



Economy--overview: Azerbaijan is less developed industrially than
  either Armenia or Georgia, the other Caucasian states. It resembles
  the Central Asian states in its majority Muslim population, high
  structural unemployment, and low standard of living. The economy's
  most prominent products are oil, cotton, and natural gas. Production
  from the Caspian oil field declined through 1997 but registered an
  increase in 1998. Negotiation of more than a dozen
  production-sharing arrangements (PSAs) with foreign firms, which
  have thus far committed $30 billion to oil field development, should
  generate the funds needed to spur future industrial development. Oil
  production under the first of these PSAs, with the Azerbaijan
  International Operating Company, began in November 1997. Azerbaijan
  shares all the formidable problems of the former Soviet republics in
  making the transition from a command to a market economy, but its
  considerable energy resources brighten its long-term prospects. Baku
  has only recently begun making progress on economic reform, and old
  economic ties and structures are slowly being replaced. A major
  short-term obstacle to economic progress, including stepped up
  foreign investment, is the continuing conflict with Armenia over the
  Nagorno-Karabakh region. Trade with Russia and the other former
  Soviet republics is declining in importance while trade is building
  up with Turkey, Iran, the UAE, and the nations of Europe. A serious
  long-term challenge is the maintenance of the competitiveness of
  non-oil exports in world markets.

Telephone system: Azerbaijani telecommunications fall under the
  Ministry of Communications; Azerbaijan's telephone system is a
  combination of old Soviet era technology used by Azerbaijani
  citizens and small- to medium-size commercial establishments, and
  modern cellular phones used by an increasing middle class, large
  commercial ventures, international companies, and most government
  officials; the average citizen waits on a 200,000-person list for
  telephone service; Internet and E-mail service are available in Baku
  domestic: local--the majority of telephones are in Baku or other
  industrial centers; intercity--about 700 villages still do not have
  public phone service; all long distance service must use Azertel's
  (Ministry of Communications) lines; satellite service connects Baku
  to a modern switch in its separated enclave to Nakhichevan
  international: the old Soviet system of cable and microwave is still
  serviceable; satellite service between Baku and Turkey provides
  access to 200 countries; additional satellite providers supply
  services between Baku and specific countries; Azerbaijan is a
  signator of the Trans-Asia-Europe Fiber-Optic Line (TAE); their
  lines are not laid but the Turkish satellite and a microwave between
  Azerbaijan and Iran can provide Azerbaijan worldwide access through
  this system

Radio broadcast stations: AM 10, FM 17, shortwave 1 (Azerbaijan's
  single shortwave station transmits its programs to the Middle East
  in eight languages)

Radios: NA

Television broadcast stations: 2; note--the Ministry of
  Communications is the monopoly broadcaster and rebroadcaster of
  television in Azerbaijan; Azerbaijani, Russian, Armenian, Iranian,
  British broadcasting companies, Voice of America, and other European
  channels are available via satellite; television is broadcast to
  Nakhichevan by satellite

Televisions: NA

Economy



Economy--overview: The Bahamas is a stable, developing nation with
  an economy heavily dependent on tourism and offshore banking.
  Tourism alone accounts for more than 60% of GDP and directly or
  indirectly employs 40% of the archipelago's labor force. Moderate
  growth in tourism receipts and a boom in construction of new hotels,
  resorts, and residences led to an increase of the country's GDP by
  an estimated 4% in 1998. Manufacturing and agriculture together
  contribute less than 10% of GDP and show little growth, despite
  government incentives aimed at those sectors. Overall growth
  prospects in the short run will depend heavily on the fortunes of
  the tourism sector and continued income growth in the US, which
  accounts for the majority of tourist visitors.

Economy



Economy--overview: In Bahrain, petroleum production and processing
  account for about 60% of export receipts, 60% of government
  revenues, and 30% of GDP. Economic conditions have fluctuated with
  the changing fortunes of oil since 1985, for example, during and
  following the Gulf crisis of 1990-91. With its highly developed
  communication and transport facilities, Bahrain is home to numerous
  multinational firms with business in the Gulf. A large share of
  exports consists of petroleum products made from imported crude.
  Construction proceeds on several major industrial projects.
  Unemployment, especially among the young, and the depletion of both
  oil and underground water resources are major long-term economic
  problems.

Economy



Economy--overview: Despite sustained domestic and international
  efforts to improve economic and demographic prospects, Bangladesh
  remains one of the world's poorest, most densely populated, and
  least developed nations. The economy is largely agricultural, with
  the cultivation of rice the single most important activity in the
  economy. Major impediments to growth include frequent cyclones and
  floods, the inefficiency of state-owned enterprises, a rapidly
  growing labor force that cannot be absorbed by agriculture, delays
  in exploiting energy resources (natural gas), inadequate power
  supplies, and slow implementation of economic reforms. Prime
  Minister Sheikh HASINA Wajed's Awami League government has made some
  headway improving the climate for foreign investors and liberalizing
  the capital markets; for example, it has negotiated with foreign
  firms for oil and gas exploration, better countrywide distribution
  of cooking gas, and the construction of natural gas pipelines and
  power plants. Progress on other economic reforms has been halting
  because of opposition from the bureaucracy, public sector unions,
  and other vested interest groups. Severe floods, lasting from July
  to October 1998, endangered the livelihoods of more than 20 million
  people. Foodgrain production fell by 4 million tons, forcing Dhaka
  to triple its normal foodgrain imports and placing severe pressure
  on Bangladesh's balance of payments. The floods increased the
  country's reliance on large-scale international aid. So far the East
  Asian financial crisis has not had major impact on the economy.

Economy



Economy--overview: Historically, the Barbadian economy had been
  dependent on sugarcane cultivation and related activities, but
  production in recent years has diversified into manufacturing and
  tourism. The start of the Port Charles Marina project in
  Speightstown helped the tourism industry continue to expand in
  1996-98. Offshore finance and informatics are important foreign
  exchange earners, and there is also a light manufacturing sector.
  The government continues its efforts to reduce the unacceptably high
  unemployment rate, encourage direct foreign investment, and
  privatize remaining state-owned enterprises.

Introduction



Background: For centuries Byelorussia has been fought over,
  devastated, and partitioned among Russia, Poland, Lithuania, and, in
  World Wars I and II, Germany. After seven decades as a Soviet
  republic, the newly named Belarus declared its independence in
  August 1991. It has retained closer political and economic ties to
  Russia than any of the other former Soviet republics. On 25 December
  1998, Russian President Boris YEL'TSIN and Belarusian President
  Aleksandr LUKASHENKO signed several agreements intended to provide
  greater political, economic, and social integration while preserving
  both states' sovereignty.

Economy



Economy--overview: Belarus has seen little structural reform since
  1995, when President LUKASHENKO launched the country on the path of
  "market socialism". In keeping with this policy, LUKASHENKO
  re-imposed administrative controls over prices and currency exchange
  rates and expanded the state's right to intervene in the management
  of private enterprise. This produced a climate hostile to private
  business, inhibiting domestic and foreign investment. The Government
  of Belarus has artificially revived economic output since mid-1996
  by pursuing a policy of rapid credit expansion. In a vain attempt to
  keep the rapidly rising inflation in check, the government placed
  strict price controls on food and consumer products, which resulted
  in food shortages. Long lines for dairy products, chicken, and pork
  became common in the closing months of 1998. With the goal of
  slowing down the devaluation of the Belarusian ruble, LUKASHENKO in
  1997 introduced a new, complex system of legal buying/selling hard
  currencies. The new "command" system proved to be totally unworkable
  and resulted in galloping devaluation. In addition to the burdens
  imposed on businesses by high inflation and an artificial currency
  regime, businesses have also been subject to pressure on the part of
  central and local governments, e.g., arbitrary changes in
  regulations, numerous rigorous inspections, and retroactive
  application of new business regulations prohibiting practices that
  had been legal. A further economic problem is the sizable trade
  deficit.

Introduction



Background: Belgium became independent from the Netherlands in
  1830 and was occupied by Germany during World Wars I and II. In the
  half century following, it has prospered as a small, modern,
  technologically advanced European state and member of the European
  Union. Its unique political circumstance is the long-standing
  differences between the wealthier Dutch-speaking Flemings of the
  north and the poorer French-speaking Walloons of the south,
  differences that are becoming increasingly acute.

Natural hazards: flooding is a threat in areas of reclaimed
  coastal land, protected from the sea by concrete dikes

Environment--current issues: the environment is exposed to intense
  pressures from human activities: urbanization, dense transportation
  network, industry, intense animal breeding and crop cultivation; air
  and water pollution also have repercussions for neighboring
  countries; uncertainties regarding federal and regional
  responsibilities (now resolved) have impeded progress in tackling
  environmental challenges

Economy



Economy--overview: This highly developed private enterprise
  economy has capitalized on its central geographic location, highly
  developed transport network, and diversified industrial and
  commercial base. Industry is concentrated mainly in the populous
  Flemish area in the north, although the government is encouraging
  reinvestment in the southern region of Wallonia. With few natural
  resources, Belgium must import substantial quantities of raw
  materials and export a large volume of manufactures, making its
  economy unusually dependent on the state of world markets.
  Two-thirds of its trade is with other EU countries. Belgium's public
  debt fell from 127% of GDP in 1996 to 122% of GDP in 1998 and the
  government is trying to control its expenditures to bring the figure
  more into line with other industrialized countries. Belgium became a
  charter member of the European Monetary Union (EMU) in January 1999.

Economy



Economy--overview: The small, essentially private enterprise
  economy is based primarily on agriculture, agro-based industry, and
  merchandising, with tourism and construction assuming greater
  importance. Sugar, the chief crop, accounts for nearly half of
  exports, while the banana industry is the country's largest
  employer. The government's tough austerity program in 1997 resulted
  in an economic slowdown that continued in 1998. The trade deficit
  has been growing, mostly as a result of low export prices for sugar
  and bananas. The new government faces important challenges to
  economic stability. Rapid action to improve tax collection has been
  promised, but a lack of progress in reigning in spending could bring
  the exchange rate under pressure.

Economy



Economy--overview: The economy of Benin remains underdeveloped and
  dependent on subsistence agriculture, cotton production, and
  regional trade. Growth in real output has averaged a sound 4% in
  1990-95 and 5% in 1996-98. Rapid population growth has offset much
  of this growth in output. Inflation has subsided over the past three
  years. Commercial and transport activities, which make up a large
  part of GDP, are vulnerable to developments in Nigeria, particularly
  fuel shortages. Support by the Paris Club and official bilateral
  creditors has eased the external debt situation in recent years. The
  government, still burdened with money-losing state enterprises and a
  bloated civil service, has been gradually implementing a World Bank
  supported structural adjustment program since 1991.

Economy



Economy--overview: Bermuda enjoys one of the highest per capita
  incomes in the world, having successfully exploited its location by
  providing financial services for international firms and luxury
  tourist facilities for 360,000 visitors annually. The tourist
  industry, which accounts for an estimated 28% of GDP, attracts 84%
  of its business from North America. The industrial sector is small,
  and agriculture is severely limited by a lack of suitable land.
  About 80% of food needs are imported. International business
  contributes over 60% of Bermuda's economic output; a failed
  independence vote in late 1995 can be partially attributed to
  Bermudian fears of scaring away foreign firms.

Economy



Economy--overview: The economy, one of the world's smallest and
  least developed, is based on agriculture and forestry, which provide
  the main livelihood for 90% of the population and account for about
  40% of GDP. Agriculture consists largely of subsistence farming and
  animal husbandry. Rugged mountains dominate the terrain and make the
  building of roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive.
  The economy is closely aligned with India's through strong trade and
  monetary links. The industrial sector is technologically backward,
  with most production of the cottage industry type. Most development
  projects, such as road construction, rely on Indian migrant labor.
  Bhutan's hydropower potential and its attraction for tourists are
  key resources. The Bhutanese Government has made some progress in
  expanding the nation's productive base and improving social welfare.
  Model education, social, and environment programs in Bhutan are
  underway with support from multilateral development organizations.
  Each economic program takes into account the government's desire to
  protect the country's environment and cultural traditions. Detailed
  controls and uncertain policies in areas like industrial licensing,
  trade, labor, and finance continue to hamper foreign investment.

Introduction



Background: Bolivia broke away from Spanish rule in 1825. Its
  subsequent history has been marked by a seemingly endless series of
  coups, counter-coups, and abrupt changes in leaders and policies.
  Comparatively democratic civilian rule was established in the 1980s,
  but the leaders have faced difficult problems of deep-seated
  poverty, social unrest, strikes, and drug dealing. Current issues
  include encouraging and negotiating the terms for foreign
  investment; strengthening the educational system; continuing the
  privatization program; pursuing judicial reform and an
  anti-corruption campaign.

Economy



Economy--overview: With its long history of semifeudal social
  controls, dependence on mineral exports, and bouts of
  hyperinflation, Bolivia has remained one of the poorest and least
  developed Latin American countries. However, Bolivia has experienced
  generally improving economic conditions since the PAZ Estenssoro
  administration (1985-89) introduced market-oriented policies which
  reduced inflation from 11,700% in 1985 to about 20% in 1988. PAZ
  Estenssoro was followed as president by Jaime PAZ Zamora (1989-93)
  who continued the free-market policies of his predecessor, despite
  opposition from his own party and from Bolivia's once powerful labor
  movement. President SANCHEZ DE LOZADA (1993-1997) vowed to advance
  the market-oriented economic reforms he helped launch as PAZ
  Estenssoro's planning minister. His successes included the signing
  of a free trade agreement with Mexico and the Southern Cone Common
  Market (Mercosur) as well as the privatization of the state airline,
  telephone company, railroad, electric power company, and oil
  company. Hugo BANZER Suarez has tried to further improve the
  country's investment climate with an anticorruption campaign. With
  the scheduled completion of a $2 billion natural gas pipeline to
  Brazil in 1999, Bolivia hopes to become an energy hub in the region.

@Bosnia and Herzegovina
----------------------





Introduction



Background: On 21 November 1995, in Dayton, Ohio, the former
  Yugoslavia's three warring parties signed a peace agreement that
  brought to a halt over three years of interethnic civil strife in
  Bosnia and Herzegovina (the final agreement was signed in Paris on
  14 December 1995). The Dayton Agreement, signed then by Bosnian
  President IZETBEGOVIC, Croatian President TUDJMAN, and Serbian
  President MILOSEVIC, divides Bosnia and Herzegovina roughly equally
  between the Muslim/Croat Federation and the Republika Srpska while
  maintaining Bosnia's currently recognized borders. In 1995-96, a
  NATO-led international peacekeeping force (IFOR) of 60,000 troops
  served in Bosnia to implement and monitor the military aspects of
  the agreement. IFOR was succeeded by a smaller, NATO-led
  Stabilization Force (SFOR) whose mission is to deter renewed
  hostilities. SFOR remains in place. A High Representative appointed
  by the UN Security Council is responsible for civilian
  implementation of the accord, including monitoring implementation,
  facilitating any difficulties arising in connection with civilian
  implementation, and coordinating activities of the civilian
  organizations and agencies in Bosnia. The Bosnian conflict began in
  the spring of 1992 when the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina
  held a referendum on independence and the Bosnian Serbs--supported by
  neighboring Serbia--responded with armed resistance aimed at
  partitioning the republic along ethnic lines and joining Serb-held
  areas to form a "greater Serbia." In March 1994, Bosnia's Muslims
  and Croats reduced the number of warring factions from three to two
  by signing an agreement in Washington creating their joint
  Muslim/Croat Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Federation,
  formed by the Muslims and Croats in March 1994, is one of two
  entities (the other being the Bosnian Serb-led Republika Srpska)
  that comprise Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Government--note: Until declaring independence in spring 1992,
  Bosnia and Herzegovina existed as a republic in the former
  Yugoslavia. Bosnia was partitioned by fighting during 1992-95 and
  governed by competing ethnic factions. Bosnia's current governing
  structures were created by the Dayton Agreement, the 1995 peace
  agreement which was officially signed in Paris on 14 December 1995
  by then Bosnian President IZETBEGOVIC, Croatian President TUDJMAN,
  and then Serbian President MILOSEVIC. This agreement retained
  Bosnia's exterior border and created a joint multi-ethnic and
  democratic government. This national government--based on
  proportional representation similar to that which existed in the
  former socialist regime--is charged with conducting foreign,
  economic, and fiscal policy. The Dayton Agreement also recognized a
  second tier of government, comprised of two entities--a joint
  Muslim/Croat Federation and the Bosnian Serb Republika Srpska
  (RS)--each presiding over roughly one-half the territory. The
  Federation and RS governments are charged with overseeing internal
  functions.



Economy



Economy--overview: Bosnia and Herzegovina ranked next to The
  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as the poorest republic in the
  old Yugoslav federation. Although agriculture has been almost all in
  private hands, farms have been small and inefficient, and the
  republic traditionally has been a net importer of food. Industry has
  been greatly overstaffed, one reflection of the rigidities of
  communist central planning and management. TITO had pushed the
  development of military industries in the republic with the result
  that Bosnia hosted a large share of Yugoslavia's defense plants. The
  bitter interethnic warfare in Bosnia caused production to plummet by
  80% from 1990 to 1995, unemployment to soar, and human misery to
  multiply. With an uneasy peace in place, output has recovered in
  1996-98 at high percentage rates on a low base, but remains far
  below the 1990 level. Key achievements in 1998 included approval of
  privatization legislation, the introduction of a national
  currency--the convertible mark, agreement with the Paris Club to
  reschedule official debt, and the conclusion of a Standby Agreement
  with the IMF. Economic data are of limited use because, although
  both entities issue figures, national-level statistics are not
  available. Moreover, official data do not capture the large share of
  activity that occurs on the black market. The country receives
  substantial amounts of reconstruction assistance and humanitarian
  aid from the international community. Wide regional differences in
  war damage and access to the outside world have resulted in
  substantial variations in living conditions among local areas and
  individual families. In 1999, Bosnia's major goals are to implement
  privatization and make progress in fiscal reform and management. In
  addition, Bosnia will have to prepare for an era of declining
  assistance from the international community.

Economy



Economy--overview: Possessing large and well-developed
  agricultural, mining, manufacturing, and service sectors, Brazil's
  economy outweighs that of all other South American countries and is
  expanding its presence in world markets. Prior to the institution of
  a stabilization plan--the Plano Real (Real Plan) in mid-1994,
  stratospheric inflation rates had disrupted economic activity and
  discouraged foreign investment. Since then, tight monetary policy
  has brought inflation under control--consumer prices increased by 2%
  in 1998 compared to more than 1,000% in 1994. At the same time, GDP
  growth slowed from 5.7% in 1994 to about 3.0% in 1997 due to tighter
  credit. The Real Plan faced its strongest challenge in 1998, as the
  world financial crisis caused investors to more closely examine the
  country's structural weaknesses. The most severe spillover for
  Brazil--after Russia's debt default in August 1998--created
  unrelenting pressure on the currency which forced the country to
  hike annual interest rates to 50%. Approximately $30 billion in
  capital left the country in August and September. After crafting a
  fiscal adjustment program and pledging progress on structural
  reform, Brazil received a $41.5 billion IMF-led international
  support program in November 1998. Capital continued to leach out of
  the country, and investors, concerned about the rising mountain of
  debt and currency widely-viewed as overvalued, stayed on the
  sidelines. In January 1999, Brazil made an abrupt shift of course in
  exchange rate policy, abandoning the strong currency anti-inflation
  anchor of the Real Plan. On 13 January 1999, Central Bank officials
  announced a one-time 8% devaluation of the real, and on 15 January
  1999, the currency was declared to be freely floating. President
  CARDOSO remains committed to limiting inflation and weathering the
  financial crisis through austerity and sacrifice as the country
  rides out a deep recession. He hopes the country will resume
  economic growth in the second half of 1999, so that he can once
  again focus on his longer-term goal of reducing poverty and income
  inequality. CARDOSO still hopes to address mandated revenue sharing
  with the states and cumbersome procedures to amend the constitution
  before the end of his second term.

Economy



Economy--overview: The economy, one of the most prosperous in the
  Caribbean, is highly dependent on tourism, which generates an
  estimated 45% of the national income. In the mid-1980s, the
  government began offering offshore registration to companies wishing
  to incorporate in the islands, and incorporation fees now generate
  substantial revenues. An estimated 250,000 companies were on the
  offshore registry by yearend 1997. The adoption of a comprehensive
  insurance law in late 1994, which provides a blanket of
  confidentiality with regulated statutory gateways for investigation
  of criminal offenses, is expected to make the British Virgin Islands
  even more attractive to international business. Livestock raising is
  the most important agricultural activity; poor soils limit the
  islands' ability to meet domestic food requirements. Because of
  traditionally close links with the US Virgin Islands, the British
  Virgin Islands has used the dollar as its currency since 1959.

Economy



Economy--overview: This small, wealthy economy is a mixture of
  foreign and domestic entrepreneurship, government regulation and
  welfare measures, and village tradition. It is almost totally
  supported by exports of crude oil and natural gas, with revenues
  from the petroleum sector accounting for over half of GDP. Per
  capita GDP is far above most other Third World countries, and
  substantial income from overseas investment supplements income from
  domestic production. The government provides for all medical
  services and subsidizes food and housing. The government is
  beginning to show progress on its basic policy of diversifying the
  economy away from oil and gas. Brunei's leaders are concerned that
  steadily increased integration in the world economy will undermine
  internal social cohesion. Because of low world oil prices and the
  Asian crisis, growth in 1999 is expected to be moderate.

Introduction



Background: A Slavic state, Bulgaria achieved independence in
  1908 after 500 years of Ottoman rule. Bulgaria fought on the losing
  side in both World Wars. After World War II it fell within the
  Soviet sphere of influence. Communist domination ended in 1991 with
  the dissolution of the USSR, and Bulgaria began the contentious
  process of moving toward political democracy and a market economy.
  In addition to the problems of structural economic reform,
  particularly privatization, Bulgaria faces the serious issues of
  keeping inflation under control and unemployment, combatting
  corruption, and curbing black-market and mafia-style crime.

Economy



Economy--overview: In April 1997, the current ruling Union of
  Democratic Forces (UDF) government won pre-term parliamentary
  elections and introduced an IMF currency board system which
  succeeded in stabilizing the economy. The triple digit inflation of
  1996 and 1997 has given way to an official consumer price increase
  of 1% in 1998. Following declines in GDP in both 1996 and 1997, the
  economy grew an officially estimated 4% in 1998. In September 1998,
  the IMF approved a three-year Extended Fund Facility, which provides
  credits worth approximately $864 million, designed to support
  Bulgaria's reform efforts. The government's structural reform
  program includes: (a) privatization and, where appropriate,
  liquidation of state-owned enterprises (SOEs); (b) liberalization of
  agricultural policies, including creating conditions for the
  development of a land market; (c) reform of the country's social
  insurance programs; and, (d) reforms to strengthen contract
  enforcement and fight crime and corruption.

Economy



Economy--overview: One of the poorest countries in the world,
  landlocked Burkina Faso has a high population density, few natural
  resources, and a fragile soil. About 85% of the population is
  engaged in (mainly subsistence) agriculture which is highly
  vulnerable to variations in rainfall. Industry remains dominated by
  unprofitable government-controlled corporations. Following the
  African franc currency devaluation in January 1994 the government
  updated its development program in conjunction with international
  agencies, and exports and economic growth have increased.
  Maintenance of its macroeconomic progress in 1999-2000 depends on
  continued low inflation, reduction in the trade deficit, and reforms
  designed to encourage private investment.

Economy



Economy--overview: Burma has a mixed economy with private activity
  dominant in agriculture, light industry, and transport, and with
  substantial state-controlled activity, mainly in energy, heavy
  industry, and the rice trade. Government policy in the last 10
  years, 1989-98, has aimed at revitalizing the economy after three
  decades of tight central planning. Thus, private activity has
  markedly increased; foreign investment has been encouraged, so far
  with moderate success; and efforts continue to increase the
  efficiency of state enterprises. Published estimates of Burma's
  foreign trade are greatly understated because of the volume of
  black-market trade. A major ongoing problem is the failure to
  achieve monetary and fiscal stability. Although Burma remains a poor
  Asian country, its rich resources furnish the potential for
  substantial long-term increases in income, exports, and living
  standards. The short-term outlook is for continued sluggish growth
  because of internal unrest, minimal foreign investment, and the
  large trade deficit.

  1996 was hailed by Rangoon as a major counternarcotics success, but
  lack of serious government commitment and resources continues to
  hinder the overall antidrug effort; growing role in the production
  of methamphetamines for regional consumption

Introduction



Background: Since the end of the Belgian trusteeship in 1962,
  Burundi has suffered from ethnic uprisings, coups, and other
  societal dislocations. In a series of waves since October 1993,
  hundreds of thousands of refugees have fled the ethnic violence
  between the Hutu and Tutsi factions in Burundi and have crossed into
  Rwanda, Tanzania, and Zaire (now called the Democratic Republic of
  the Congo or DROC). Since October 1996, an estimated 120,000
  Burundian Hutu refugees from the DROC have been compelled to return
  to Burundi because of insecurity in the region. Continuing ethnic
  violence with the Tutsi has caused additional Hutu to flee to
  Tanzania, thus raising their numbers in the United Nations Office of
  the High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) camps in that country to
  about 260,000. Burundian troops have joined armies from Rwanda and
  Uganda and Congolese Tutsi in trying to overthrow DROC President
  KABILA and restore security to their borders with the Democratic
  Republic of the Congo.

Economy



Economy--overview: Burundi is a landlocked, resource-poor country
  with a poorly developed manufacturing sector. The economy is
  predominately agricultural with roughly 90% of the population
  dependent on subsistence agriculture. Its economic health depends on
  the coffee crop, which accounts for 80% of foreign exchange
  earnings. The ability to pay for imports therefore rests largely on
  the vagaries of the climate and the international coffee market.
  Since October 1993 the nation has suffered from massive ethnic-based
  violence which has resulted in the death of perhaps 250,000 persons
  and the displacement of about 800,000 others. Foods, medicines, and
  electricity remain in short supply.

Economy



Economy--overview: After four years of solid macroeconomic
  performance, Cambodia's economy slowed dramatically in 1997-98 due
  to the regional economic crisis, civil violence, and political
  infighting. Foreign investment fell off, and tourism has declined
  from 1996 levels. Also, in 1998 the main harvest was hit by drought.
  The long-term development of the economy after decades of war
  remains a daunting challenge. Human resource levels in the
  population are low, particularly in the poverty-ridden countryside.
  The almost total lack of basic infrastructure in the countryside
  will continue to hinder development. Recurring political instability
  and corruption within government discourage foreign investment and
  delay foreign aid. Even so, growth may resume in 1999 at, say, 2%.

Economy



Economy--overview: Because of its oil resources and favorable
  agricultural conditions, Cameroon has one of the best-endowed
  primary commodity economies in sub-Saharan Africa. Still, it faces
  many of the serious problems facing other underdeveloped countries,
  such as a top-heavy civil service and a generally unfavorable
  climate for business enterprise. Since 1990, the government has
  embarked on various IMF and World Bank programs designed to spur
  business investment, increase efficiency in agriculture, improve
  trade, and recapitalize the nation's banks. The government, however,
  has failed to press forward vigorously with these programs. The
  latest enhanced structural adjustment agreement was signed in
  October 1997; the parties hope this will prove more successful, yet
  government mismanagement and corruption remain problems. Inflation
  has been brought back under control. Progress toward privatization
  of remaining state industry may support economic growth in 1999-2000.

Introduction



Background: A land of vast distances and rich natural resources,
  from 1867 on Canada has enjoyed de facto independence while
  retaining, even to the present day, certain formal ties to the
  British crown. Economically and technologically the nation has
  developed in parallel with the US, its neighbor to the south across
  an unfortified border. Its paramount political problem continues to
  be the relationship of the province of Quebec, with its
  French-speaking residents and unique culture, to the remainder of
  the country.

  permanent pastures: 3%
  forests and woodland: 54%
  other: 38% (1993 est.)

Irrigated land: 7,100 sq km (1993 est.)

Natural hazards: continuous permafrost in north is a serious
  obstacle to development; cyclonic storms form east of the Rocky
  Mountains, a result of the mixing of air masses from the Arctic,
  Pacific, and North American interior, and produce most of the
  country's rain and snow

Environment--current issues: air pollution and resulting acid rain
  severely affecting lakes and damaging forests; metal smelting,
  coal-burning utilities, and vehicle emissions impacting on
  agricultural and forest productivity; ocean waters becoming
  contaminated due to agricultural, industrial, mining, and forestry
  activities

Environment--international agreements:
  party to: Air Pollution, Air Pollution-Nitrogen Oxides, Air
  Pollution-Persistent Organic Pollutants, Air Pollution-Sulphur 85,
  Air Pollution-Sulphur 94, Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate

Economy



Economy--overview: As an affluent, high-tech industrial society,
  Canada today closely resembles the US in its market-oriented
  economic system, pattern of production, and high living standards.
  Since World War II, the impressive growth of the manufacturing,
  mining, and service sectors has transformed the nation from a
  largely rural economy into one primarily industrial and urban. Real
  rates of growth have averaged nearly 3.0% since 1993. Unemployment
  is falling and government budget surpluses are being partially
  devoted to reducing the large public sector debt. The 1989 US-Canada
  Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and 1994 North American Free Trade
  Agreement (NAFTA) (which included Mexico) have touched off a
  dramatic increase in trade and economic integration with the US.
  With its great natural resources, skilled labor force, and modern
  capital plant Canada can anticipate solid economic prospects in the
  future. The continuing constitutional impasse between English- and
  French-speaking areas is raising the possibility of a split in the
  federation, making foreign investors somewhat edgy.

Economy



Economy--overview: Cape Verde's low per capita GDP reflects a poor
  natural resource base, including serious water shortages exacerbated
  by cycles of long-term drought. The economy is service-oriented,
  with commerce, transport, and public services accounting for almost
  70% of GDP. Although nearly 70% of the population lives in rural
  areas, the share of agriculture in GDP in 1995 was only 8%, of which
  fishing accounts for 1.5%. About 90% of food must be imported. The
  fishing potential, mostly lobster and tuna, is not fully exploited.
  Cape Verde annually runs a high trade deficit, financed by foreign
  aid and remittances from emigrants; remittances constitute a
  supplement to GDP of more than 20%. Economic reforms, launched by
  the new democratic government in 1991, are aimed at developing the
  private sector and attracting foreign investment to diversify the
  economy. Prospects for 1999 depend heavily on the maintenance of aid
  flows, remittances, and the momentum of the government's development
  program.

@Central African Republic
------------------------





Introduction



Background: In 1996, the country experienced three mutinies by
  dissident elements of the armed forces, which demanded back pay as
  well as political and military reforms. Subsequent violence between
  the government and rebel military groups over pay issues, living
  conditions, and lack of opposition party representation in the
  government, destroyed many businesses in the capital, reduced tax
  revenues, and exacerbated the government's problems in meeting
  expenses. African peacekeepers restored order in 1997; in April 1998
  the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic (MINURCA)
  assumed responsibility for peacekeeping operations.

Economy



Economy--overview: Subsistence agriculture, together with
  forestry, remains the backbone of the economy of the Central African
  Republic (CAR), with more than 70% of the population living in
  outlying areas. The agricultural sector generates half of GDP.
  Timber has accounted for about 16% of export earnings and the
  diamond industry for nearly 54%. Important constraints to economic
  development include the CAR's landlocked position, a poor
  transportation system, a largely unskilled work force, and a legacy
  of misdirected macroeconomic policies. The 50% devaluation of the
  currencies of 14 Francophone African nations on 12 January 1994 had
  mixed effects on the CAR's economy. Diamond, timber, coffee, and
  cotton exports increased, leading an estimated rise of GDP of 7% in
  1994 and nearly 5% in 1995. Military rebellions and social unrest in
  1996 were accompanied by widespread destruction of property and a
  drop in GDP of 2%. Ongoing violence between the government and rebel
  military groups over pay issues, living conditions, and political
  representation has destroyed many businesses in the capital and
  reduced tax revenues for the government. The IMF approved an
  Extended Structure Adjustment Facility in 1998.

Introduction



Background: In 1960, Chad gained full independence from France.
  In December 1990, after Chad had endured three decades of ethnic
  warfare as well as invasions by Libya, former northern guerrilla
  leader Idriss DEBY seized control of the government. His
  transitional government eventually suppressed or came to terms with
  most political-military groups, settled the territorial dispute with
  Libya on terms favorable to Chad, drafted a democratic constitution
  which was ratified by popular referendum in 1996, held multiparty
  national presidential elections in 1996 (DEBY won with 69% of the
  vote), and held multiparty elections for the National Assembly in
  1997 (DEBY's Patriotic Salvation Movement won a majority of the
  seats). But by the end of 1998, DEBY was beset with numerous
  problems including heavy casualties in the Democratic Republic of
  the Congo where Chadian troops had been deployed to support
  embattled President KABILA, a new rebellion in northern Chad, and
  further delays in the Doba Basin oil project in the south.

Economy



Economy--overview: Landlocked Chad's economic development suffers
  from it's geographic remoteness, drought, lack of infrastructure,
  and political turmoil. About 85% of the population depends on
  agriculture, including the herding of livestock. Of Africa's
  Francophone countries, Chad benefited least from the 50% devaluation
  of their currencies in January 1994. Financial aid from the World
  Bank, the African Development Fund, and other sources is directed
  largely at the improvement of agriculture, especially livestock
  production. Lack of financing and low oil prices, however, are
  stalling the development of an oil field in the Doba Basin and the
  construction of a proposed oil pipeline through Cameroon.

Economy



Economy--overview: Chile has a prosperous, essentially free market
  economy. Civilian governments--which took over from the military in
  March 1990--have continued to reduce the government's role in the
  economy while shifting the emphasis of public spending toward social
  programs. Growth in real GDP averaged more than 7.0% in 1991-1997
  but fell to about half of that average in 1998 because of spillover
  from the global financial crisis. Inflation has been on a downward
  trend and hit a 60-year low in 1998. Chile's currency and foreign
  reserves also are strong, as sustained foreign capital
  inflows--including significant direct investment--have more than
  offset current account deficits and public debt buy-backs. President
  FREI, who took office in March 1994, has placed improving Chile's
  education system and developing foreign export markets at the top of
  his economic agenda. The Chilean economy remains largely dependent
  on a few sectors--particularly copper mining, fishing, and forestry.
  Success in meeting the government's goal of sustained annual
  economic growth of 5% depends largely on world prices for these
  commodities, continued foreign investor confidence, and the
  government's ability to maintain a conservative fiscal stance. In
  1996, Chile became an associate member of Mercosur and concluded a
  free trade agreement with Canada.

Introduction



Background: For most of its 3,500 years of history, China led the
  world in agriculture, crafts, and science, then fell behind in the
  19th century when the Industrial Revolution gave the West clear
  superiority in military and economic affairs. In the first half of
  the 20th century, China continued to suffer from major famines,
  civil unrest, military defeat, and foreign occupation. After World
  War II, the Communists under MAO Zedong established a dictatorship
  that, while ensuring China's autonomy, imposed strict controls over
  all aspects of life and cost the lives of tens of millions of
  people. After 1978, his successor DENG Xiaoping decentralized
  economic decision making; output quadrupled in the next 20 years.
  Political controls remain tight at the same time economic controls
  have been weakening. Present issues are: incorporating Hong Kong
  into the Chinese system; closing down inefficient state-owned
  enterprises; modernizing the military; fighting corruption; and
  providing support to tens of millions of displaced workers.

Economy



Economy--overview: Beginning in late 1978 the Chinese leadership
  has been trying to move the economy from a sluggish Soviet-style
  centrally planned economy to a more market-oriented economy but
  still within a rigid political framework of Communist Party control.
  To this end the authorities switched to a system of household
  responsibility in agriculture in place of the old collectivization,
  increased the authority of local officials and plant managers in
  industry, permitted a wide variety of small-scale enterprise in
  services and light manufacturing, and opened the economy to
  increased foreign trade and investment. The result has been a
  quadrupling of GDP since 1978. Agricultural output doubled in the
  1980s, and industry also posted major gains, especially in coastal
  areas near Hong Kong and opposite Taiwan, where foreign investment
  helped spur output of both domestic and export goods. On the darker
  side, the leadership has often experienced in its hybrid system the
  worst results of socialism (bureaucracy, lassitude, corruption) and
  of capitalism (windfall gains and stepped-up inflation). Beijing
  thus has periodically backtracked, retightening central controls at
  intervals. In late 1993 China's leadership approved additional
  long-term reforms aimed at giving still more play to market-oriented
  institutions and at strengthening the center's control over the
  financial system; state enterprises would continue to dominate many
  key industries in what was now termed "a socialist market economy".
  In 1995-97 inflation dropped sharply, reflecting tighter monetary
  policies and stronger measures to control food prices. At the same
  time, the government struggled to (a) collect revenues due from
  provinces, businesses, and individuals; (b) reduce corruption and
  other economic crimes; and (c) keep afloat the large state-owned
  enterprises, most of which had not participated in the vigorous
  expansion of the economy and many of which had been losing the
  ability to pay full wages and pensions. From 60 to 100 million
  surplus rural workers are adrift between the villages and the
  cities, many subsisting through part-time low-paying jobs. Popular
  resistance, changes in central policy, and loss of authority by
  rural cadres have weakened China's population control program, which
  is essential to maintaining growth in living standards. Another
  long-term threat to continued rapid economic growth is the
  deterioration in the environment, notably air pollution, soil
  erosion, and the steady fall of the water table especially in the
  north. China continues to lose arable land because of erosion and
  economic development. The next few years may witness increasing
  tensions between a highly centralized political system and an
  increasingly decentralized economic system. Economic growth probably
  will slow to more moderate levels in 1999-2000.

Introduction



Background: Colombia gained its independence from Spain in 1819.
  Earlier than most countries in the area, it established traditions
  of civilian government with regular, free elections. In recent
  years, however, assassinations, widespread guerrilla activities, and
  drug trafficking have severely disrupted normal public and private
  activities.

Economy



Economy--overview: Colombia ended 1998 in recession with 0.2% GDP
  growth due to a combination of low world oil prices, reduced export
  demand, guerrilla violence, and diminished investment flows. The
  Central Bank resorted to interest rate hikes and tight monetary
  policy to defend the peso against pressure from Colombia's worsening
  trade and fiscal deficits. President PASTRANA'S well-respected
  financial team is working to deal with the myriad economic problems
  the country faces, including the highest unemployment level in
  decades and a fiscal deficit of close to 5% of GDP in 1998. The
  government implemented austerity measures, declared emergency
  measures to guard against a potential banking crisis resulting from
  the country's economic slowdown, and is seeking international
  assistance to fund a peace plan with the guerrillas. Guerrilla
  violence and low world oil prices will likely continue to undermine
  the economy in 1999.

Introduction



Background: Comoros has had difficulty in achieving political
  stability, having endured 18 coups or attempted coups since
  receiving independence from France in 1975. Most recently, in August
  1997, the islands of Anjouan and Moheli declared their independence
  from Comoros. An attempt in September 1997 by the government to
  reestablish control over the rebellious islands by force failed, and
  presently the Organization of African Unity is brokering
  negotiations to effect a reconciliation.

Economy



Economy--overview: One of the world's poorest countries, Comoros
  is made up of three islands that have inadequate transportation
  links, a young and rapidly increasing population, and few natural
  resources. The low educational level of the labor force contributes
  to a subsistence level of economic activity, high unemployment, and
  a heavy dependence on foreign grants and technical assistance.
  Agriculture, including fishing, hunting, and forestry, is the
  leading sector of the economy. It contributes 40% to GDP, employs
  80% of the labor force, and provides most of the exports. The
  country is not self-sufficient in food production; rice, the main
  staple, accounts for the bulk of imports. The government is
  struggling to upgrade education and technical training, to privatize
  commercial and industrial enterprises, to improve health services,
  to diversify exports, to promote tourism, and to reduce the high
  population growth rate. Continued foreign support is essential if
  the goal of 4% annual GDP growth is to be maintained.

Economy



Economy--overview: The economy of the Democratic Republic of the
  Congo--a nation endowed with vast potential wealth--has declined
  significantly since the mid-1980s. The new government instituted a
  tight fiscal policy that initially curbed inflation and currency
  depreciation, but these small gains were quickly reversed when the
  foreign-backed rebellion in the eastern part of the country began in
  August 1998. The war has dramatically reduced government revenue,
  and increased external debt. Foreign businesses have curtailed
  operations due to uncertainty about the outcome of the conflict and
  because of increased government harassment and restrictions. Poor
  infrastructure, an uncertain legal framework, corruption, and lack
  of transparency in government economic policy remain a brake on
  investment and growth. A number of IMF and World Bank missions have
  met with the new government to help it develop a coherent economic
  plan but associated reforms are on hold.

Economy



Economy--overview: The economy is a mixture of village agriculture
  and handicrafts, an industrial sector based largely on oil, support
  services, and a government characterized by budget problems and
  overstaffing. Oil has supplanted forestry as the mainstay of the
  economy, providing a major share of government revenues and exports.
  In the early 1980s, rapidly rising oil revenues enabled the
  government to finance large-scale development projects with GDP
  growth averaging 5% annually, one of the highest rates in Africa.
  Subsequently, falling oil prices cut GDP growth by half. Moreover,
  the government has mortgaged a substantial portion of its oil
  earnings, contributing to the government's shortage of revenues. The
  12 January 1994 devaluation of Franc Zone currencies by 50% resulted
  in inflation of 61% in 1994 but inflation has subsided since.
  Economic reform efforts continued with the support of international
  organizations, notably the World Bank and the IMF. The reform
  program came to a halt in June 1997 when civil war erupted. Denis
  SASSOU-NGUESSO, who returned to power when the war ended in October
  1997, publicly expressed interest in moving forward on economic
  reforms and privatization and in renewing cooperation with
  international financial institutions. However, economic progress was
  badly hurt by slumping oil prices in 1998, which worsened the
  Republic of the Congo's budget deficit. A second blow was the
  resumption of armed conflict in December 1998.

@Cook Islands
------------





Introduction



Background: Named after Captain Cook, who sighted them in 1770,
  the islands became a British protectorate in 1888. By 1900,
  administrative control was transferred to New Zealand. Residents
  chose self-government with free association with New Zealand in
  1965. The emigration of Cook Islanders to New Zealand in large
  numbers and resulting loss of skilled labor and government deficits
  are continuing problems.

Economy



Economy--overview: Like many other South Pacific island nations,
  the Cook Islands' economic development is hindered by the isolation
  of the country from foreign markets, lack of natural resources,
  periodic devastation from natural disasters, and inadequate
  infrastructure. Agriculture provides the economic base with major
  exports made up of copra and citrus fruit. Manufacturing activities
  are limited to fruit-processing, clothing, and handicrafts. Trade
  deficits are made up for by remittances from emigrants and by
  foreign aid, overwhelmingly from New Zealand. In 1996, the
  government declared bankruptcy, citing a $120 million public debt.
  Efforts to exploit tourism potential and expanding the mining and
  fishing industries have not been enough to adequately deal with the
  financial crisis. In an effort to stem further erosion of the
  economy, the government slashed public service salaries by 50%,
  condensed the number of government ministries from 52 to 22, reduced
  the number of civil servants by more than half, began selling
  government assets, and closed all overseas diplomatic posts except
  for the one in New Zealand.

  Increasing the role of the private sector while maintaining the
  government's social safety net and keeping under control the budget
  deficit, unemployment, and inflation are key current issues.

Economy



Economy--overview: Costa Rica's basically stable economy depends
  on tourism, agriculture, and electronics exports. Poverty has been
  substantially reduced over the past 15 years and a strong social
  safety net has been put into place. Economic growth has rebounded
  from -0.9% in 1996 to 3% in 1997 and an estimated 5.5% in 1998.
  Inflation rose to 22.5% in 1995, dropped to 11.1% in 1997, and
  reached an estimated 12% in 1998. Unemployment appears moderate at
  5.6%, but substantial underemployment continues. Furthermore, large
  government deficits--fueled by interest payments on the massive
  internal debt--have undermined efforts to maintain the quality of
  social services. Curbing inflation, reducing the deficit, and
  improving public sector efficiency remain key challenges to the
  government. President RODRIGUEZ has called for an increased economic

Economy



Economy--overview: Cote d'Ivoire is among the world's largest
  producers and exporters of coffee, cocoa beans, and palm oil.
  Consequently, the economy is highly sensitive to fluctuations in
  international prices for these products and to weather conditions.
  Despite attempts by the government to diversify the economy, it is
  still largely dependent on agriculture and related activities, which
  engage roughly 68% of the population. After several years of lagging
  performance, the Ivorian economy began a comeback in 1994, due to
  the devaluation of the CFA franc and improved prices for cocoa and
  coffee, growth in nontraditional primary exports such as pineapples
  and rubber, limited trade and banking liberalization, offshore oil
  and gas discoveries, and generous external financing and debt
  rescheduling by multilateral lenders and France. The 50% devaluation
  of Franc Zone currencies on 12 January 1994 caused a one-time jump
  in the inflation rate to 26% in 1994, but the rate fell sharply in
  1996-98. Moreover, government adherence to donor-mandated reforms
  led to a jump in growth to 6% annually in 1996-98. Growth may slow
  in 1999-2000 because of the difficulty of meeting the conditions of
  international donors and continued low prices of key exports.

Economy



Economy--overview: Before the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the
  Republic of Croatia, after Slovenia, was the most prosperous and
  industrialized area, with a per capita output perhaps one-third
  above the Yugoslav average. Croatia faces considerable economic
  problems stemming from: the legacy of longtime communist
  mismanagement of the economy; damage during the internecine fighting
  to bridges, factories, power lines, buildings, and houses; the large
  refugee and displaced population, both Croatian and Bosnian; and the
  disruption of economic ties. Western aid and investment, especially
  in the tourist and oil industries, would help restore the economy.
  The government has been successful in some reform efforts--partially
  macroeconomic stabilization policies--and it has normalized relations
  with its creditors. Yet it still is struggling with privatization of
  large state enterprises and with bank reform. In 1998, Croatia made
  progress in reducing its current account deficit to about 8% of GDP
  from 12% the previous year. Economic growth continues to lag,
  however, and growing levels of inter-enterprise debt plague the
  domestic economy. Four commercial banks were put under government
  control and a major conglomerate is teetering on collapse.

Introduction



Background: Fidel CASTRO led a rebel army to victory in 1959, and
  his guiding vision has defined Cuba's Communist revolution while his
  iron will has held the country together for more than four decades.
  CASTRO brought Cuba onto the world stage by inviting Soviet support
  in the 1960s, inciting revolutionary movements throughout Latin
  America and Africa in the 1970s, and sending his army to fight in
  Angola in the 1980s. At home, Havana provided Cubans with high
  levels of healthcare, education, and social security while
  suppressing the Roman Catholic Church and arresting political
  dissidents. Cuba is slowly recovering from severe economic recession
  following the withdrawal of former-Soviet subsidies, worth
  $4billion-$6 billion per year, in 1990.

Economy



Economy--overview: The state plays the primary role in the economy
  and controls practically all foreign trade. The government has
  undertaken several reforms in recent years to stem excess liquidity,
  increase labor incentives, and alleviate serious shortages of food,
  consumer goods, and services. The liberalized agricultural markets
  introduced in October 1994, at which state and private farmers sell
  above-quota production at unrestricted prices, have broadened legal
  consumption alternatives and reduced black market prices. Government
  efforts to lower subsidies to unprofitable enterprises and to shrink
  the money supply caused the semi-official exchange rate for the
  Cuban peso to move from a peak of 120 to the dollar in the summer of
  1994 to 21 to the dollar by yearend 1998. New taxes introduced in
  1996 helped drive down the number of self-employed workers from
  208,000 in January 1996 to 155,000 by July 1998. Havana announced in
  1995 that GDP declined by 35% during 1989-93, the result of lost
  Soviet aid and domestic inefficiencies. The drop in GDP apparently
  halted in 1994, when Cuba reported 0.7% growth, followed by
  increases of 2.5% in 1995 and 7.8% in 1996. Growth slowed again in
  1997 and 1998 to 2.5% and 1.2% respectively. Export earnings
  declined 22% in 1998, to $1.4 billion, the result of lower sugar
  export volume and lower world prices for nickel and sugar. Import
  expenditures also fell 15% to $3.0 billion, in part due to lower
  world oil prices. Tourism and remittances play a key role in foreign
  currency earnings. Living standards for the average Cuban remain at
  a depressed level compared with 1990.

Economy



Economy--overview: Economic affairs are dominated by the division
  of the country into the southern (Greek) area controlled by the
  Cyprus Government and the northern Turkish Cypriot-administered
  area. The Greek Cypriot economy is prosperous but highly susceptible
  to external shocks. Erratic growth rates in the 1990s reflect the
  economy's vulnerability to swings in tourist arrivals, caused by
  political instability on the island and fluctuations in economic
  conditions in Western Europe. Economic policy in the south is
  focused on meeting the criteria for admission to the EU. As in the
  Turkish sector, water shortage is a growing problem, and several
  desalination plants are planned. The Turkish Cypriot economy has
  about one-fifth the population and one-third the per capita GDP of
  the south. Because it is recognized only by Turkey, it has had much
  difficulty arranging foreign financing, and foreign firms have
  hesitated to invest there. The economy remains heavily dependent on
  agriculture and government service, which together employ about half
  of the work force. Moreover, the small, vulnerable economy has
  suffered because the Turkish lira is legal tender. To compensate for
  the economy's weakness, Turkey provides direct and indirect aid to
  nearly every sector, e.g. tourism, education, and industry.

Introduction



Background: Once part of the Holy Roman Empire and, later, the
  Austro-Hungarian monarchy, Czechoslovakia became an independent
  nation at the end of World War I. Independence ended with the German
  takeover in 1939. After World War II, Czechoslovakia fell within the
  Soviet sphere of influence, and in 1968 an invasion by Warsaw Pact
  troops snuffed out anti-communist demonstrations and riots. With the
  collapse of Soviet authority in 1991, Czechoslovakia regained its
  freedom. On 1 January 1993, the country peacefully split into its
  two ethnic components, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The Czech
  Republic, largely by aspiring to become a NATO and EU member, has
  moved toward integration in world markets, a development that poses
  both opportunities and risks. But Prague has had a difficult time
  convincing the public that membership in NATO is crucial to Czech
  security. At the same time, support for eventual EU membership is
  waning. Coupled with the country's worsening economic situation,
  Prague's political scene, troubled for the past three years, will
  remain so for the foreseeable future.

Economy



Economy--overview: Political and financial crises in 1997
  shattered the Czech Republic's image as one of the most stable and
  prosperous of post-Communist states. Delays in enterprise
  restructuring and failure to develop a well-functioning capital
  market played major roles in Czech economic troubles, which
  culminated in a currency crisis in May. The currency was forced out
  of its fluctuation band as investors worried that the current
  account deficit, which reached nearly 8% of GDP in 1996, would
  become unsustainable. After expending $3 billion in vain to support
  the currency, the central bank let it float. The growing current
  account imbalance reflected a surge in domestic demand and poor
  export performance, as wage increases outpaced productivity. The
  government was forced to introduce two austerity packages later in
  the spring which cut government spending by 2.5% of GDP. A tough
  1998 budget continued the painful medicine. These problems were
  compounded in the summer of 1997 by unprecedented flooding which
  inundated much of the eastern part of the country. Czech
  difficulties contrast with earlier achievements of strong GDP
  growth, a balanced budget, and inflation and unemployment that were
  among the lowest in the region. The Czech economy's transition
  problems continue to be too much direct and indirect government
  influence on the privatized economy, the sometimes ineffective
  management of privatized firms, and a shortage of experienced
  financial analysts for the banking system. The country slipped into
  a mild recession in 1998, but hopes to rebound with 1% growth in
  1999.

Economy



Economy--overview: This thoroughly modern market economy features
  high-tech agriculture, up-to-date small-scale and corporate
  industry, extensive government welfare measures, comfortable living
  standards, and high dependence on foreign trade. Denmark is a net
  exporter of food. The center-left coalition government will
  concentrate on reducing the persistently high unemployment rate and
  the budget deficit as well as following the previous government's
  policies of maintaining low inflation and a current account surplus.
  The coalition also vows to maintain a stable currency. The coalition
  has lowered marginal income taxes while maintaining overall tax
  revenues; boosted industrial competitiveness through labor market
  and tax reforms and increased research and development funds; and
  improved welfare services for the neediest while cutting paperwork
  and delays. Denmark chose not to join the 11 other EU members who
  launched the euro on 1 January 1999. Because of the global slowdown,
  GDP growth may fall to 1% in 1999.

Economy



Economy--overview: The economy is based on service activities
  connected with the country's strategic location and status as a free
  trade zone in northeast Africa. Two-thirds of the inhabitants live
  in the capital city, the remainder being mostly nomadic herders.
  Scanty rainfall limits crop production to fruits and vegetables, and
  most food must be imported. Djibouti provides services as both a
  transit port for the region and an international transshipment and
  refueling center. It has few natural resources and little industry.
  The nation is, therefore, heavily dependent on foreign assistance to
  help support its balance of payments and to finance development
  projects. An unemployment rate of 40% to 50% continues to be a major
  problem. Per capita consumption dropped an estimated 35% over the
  last seven years because of recession, civil war, and a high
  population growth rate (including immigrants and refugees). Also,
  renewed fighting between Ethiopia and Eritrea has disturbed normal
  external channels of commerce. Faced with a multitude of economic
  difficulties, the government has fallen in arrears on long-term
  external debt and has been struggling to meet the stipulations of
  foreign aid donors.

Economy



Economy--overview: The economy depends on agriculture and is
  highly vulnerable to climatic conditions, notably tropical storms.
  Agriculture, primarily bananas, accounts for 20% of GDP and employs
  40% of the labor force. Development of the tourist industry remains
  difficult because of the rugged coastline, lack of beaches, and the
  lack of an international airport. Hurricane Luis devastated the
  country's banana crop in September 1995; tropical storms had wiped
  out one-quarter of the crop in 1994 as well. The economy began to
  recover in mid-1998, fueled by increases in construction, soap
  production, and tourist arrivals. The government is attempting to
  develop an offshore financial industry in order to diversify the
  island's production base.

Economy



Economy--overview: In December 1996, incoming President FERNANDEZ
  presented a bold reform package for this Caribbean economy--including
  the devaluation of the peso, income tax cuts, a 50% increase in
  sales taxes, reduced import tariffs, and increased gasoline
  prices--in an attempt to create a market-oriented economy that can
  compete internationally. Even though most reforms are stalled in the
  legislature, the economy grew vigorously in 1997-98, with tourism
  and telecommunications leading the advance. The government is
  working to increase electric generating capacity, a key to continued
  economic growth, but the privatization of the state electricity
  company has met numerous delays. In late September 1998, Hurricane
  Georges caused approximately $1.3 billion in damages, largely to
  agriculture and infrastructure.

Economy



Economy--overview: Ecuador has substantial oil resources and rich
  agricultural areas. Because the country exports primary products
  such as oil, bananas, and shrimp, fluctuations in world market
  prices can have a substantial domestic impact. Ecuador joined the
  World Trade Organization in 1996, but has failed to comply with many
  of its accession commitments. In recent years, growth has been
  uneven due to ill-conceived fiscal stabilization measures. The
  populist government of Abdala BUCARAM Ortiz proposed a major
  currency reform in 1996, but popular discontent with BUCARAM'S
  austerity measures and rampant official corruption led to his
  replacement by National Congress with Fabian ALARCON in February
  1997. ALARCON adopted a minimalist economic program that put off
  necessary reforms until August 1998 when President Jamil MAHUAD was
  elected. MAHAUD inherited an economy in crisis due to mismanagement,
  El Nino damage to key export sectors such as agriculture, and low
  world commodity prices in the wake of the Asian financial crisis.
  MAHAUD announced a fiscal austerity package and expressed interest
  in an IMF agreement but faces major difficulties in promoting
  economic growth, including possible political objections to further
  reform.

Introduction



Background: One of the four great ancient civilizations, Egypt,
  ruled by powerful pharaohs, bequeathed to Western civilization
  numerous advances in technology, science, and the arts. For the last
  two millennia, however, Egypt has served a series of foreign
  masters--Persians, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, Turks, and the
  British. Formal independence came in 1922, and the remnants of
  British control ended after World War II. The completion of the
  Aswan High Dam in 1981 altered the time-honored place of the Nile
  River in the agriculture and ecology of Egypt. A rapidly growing
  population will stress Egyptian society and resources as it enters
  the new millenium.

Economy



Economy--overview: At the end of the 1980s, Egypt faced problems
  of low productivity and poor economic management, compounded by the
  adverse social effects of excessive population growth, high
  inflation, and massive urban overcrowding. In the face of these
  pressures, in 1991 Egypt undertook wide-ranging macroeconomic
  stabilization and structural reform measures. This reform effort has
  been supported by three IMF arrangements, the last of which expired
  in September 1998. Egypt's reform efforts--and its participation in
  the Gulf war coalition--also led to massive debt relief under the
  Paris Club arrangements. Substantial progress has been made in
  improving macroeconomic performance. Cairo tamed inflation, slashed
  budget deficits, and built up foreign reserves to an all-time high.
  Although the pace of structural reforms--such as privatization and
  new business legislation--has been slower than envisioned under the
  IMF program, Egypt's steps toward a more market-oriented economy
  have prompted increased foreign investment. The November 1997
  massacre of foreign tourists in Luxor affected tourism enough to
  slow the GDP growth rate for 1998 compared to earlier projections.
  Tourism's slow recovery, coupled with low world oil prices, caused a
  downturn in foreign exchange earnings in 1998, but external payments
  are not in crisis.

Economy



Economy--overview: In recent years inflation has fallen to
  unprecedented levels, and exports have grown substantially. Even so,
  El Salvador has experienced sizable deficits in both its trade and
  its fiscal accounts. The trade deficit has been offset by
  remittances from the large number of Salvadorans living abroad and
  from external aid. El Salvador sustained damage from Hurricane
  Mitch, but not as much as other Central American countries.
  Inflation and the trade deficit are expected to rise somewhat as a
  result.

Economy



Economy--overview: The discovery and exploitation of large oil
  reserves have contributed to dramatic economic growth in recent
  years. Several large oil companies are expected to bid on oil
  licenses by May 1999. Forestry, farming, and fishing are also major
  components of GDP. Subsistence farming predominates. Although
  pre-independence Equatorial Guinea counted on cocoa production for
  hard currency earnings, the deterioration of the rural economy under
  successive brutal regimes has diminished potential for
  agriculture-led growth. A number of aid programs sponsored by the
  World Bank and the IMF have been cut off since 1993 because of the
  government's gross corruption and mismanagement. Businesses, for the
  most part, are owned by government officials and their family
  members. Undeveloped natural resources include titanium, iron ore,
  manganese, uranium, and alluvial gold. The country responded
  favorably to the devaluation of the CFA franc in January 1994.

  23-25 April 1993 referendum on independence from Ethiopia. The
  referendum resulted in a landslide vote for independence, which
  became effective on 24 May 1993.

Economy



Economy--overview: With independence from Ethiopia on 24 May 1993,
  Eritrea faced the bitter economic problem of a small, desperately
  poor African country. The economy is largely based on subsistence
  agriculture, with over 70% of the population involved in farming and
  herding. The small industrial sector consists mainly of light
  industries with outmoded technologies. Domestic output (GDP) is
  substantially augmented by worker remittances from abroad.
  Government revenues come from custom duties and taxes on income and
  sales. Road construction is a top domestic priority. Eritrea has
  long-term prospects for revenues from the development of offshore
  oil, offshore fishing, and tourism. Eritrea's economic future
  depends on its ability to master fundamental social and economic
  problems, e.g., overcoming illiteracy, promoting job creation,
  expanding technical training, attracting foreign investment, and
  streamlining the bureaucracy. The most immediate threat to the
  economy, however, is the possible expansion of the armed conflict
  with Ethiopia.

Introduction



Background: In and out of Swedish and Russian control over the
  centuries, this little Baltic state was re-incorporated into the
  USSR after German occupation in World War II. Independence came with
  the collapse of the USSR in 1991; the last Russian troops left in
  1994. Estonia thus became free to promote economic and political
  ties with Western Europe. The position of ethnic Russians (29% of
  the population) remains an issue of concern to Moscow. European
  Union (EU) membership negotiations, which began in 1998, remain a
  domestic issue.

Economy



Economy--overview: Estonia's continued adherence to market
  reforms, disciplined fiscal and monetary policies, and a liberal
  free trade regime resulted in GDP growth in 1998 of 5.5% and a
  decrease in inflation to 6.5% from 11.2% in 1997. A high but
  slightly decreased current account deficit was estimated at 8.6%.
  The fall in GDP growth is largely due to the impact of Russia's
  financial crisis and reduced investment in emerging markets in the
  wake of the Asian financial crisis. Like other small emerging
  markets, Estonia will face difficulties in 1999 as a result of
  continuing fallout from Asia. Key events of 1998 were the start of
  official EU accession talks, banking sector consolidation--nine banks
  were reduced to five--and the important role that Swedish capital
  played in the large banks (Swedbank's acquisition of a majority
  stake in Hansapank has accounted for the large increase in foreign
  direct investment). The IMF urged Estonia to maintain a stable
  economy and good reputation in international markets and to avoid
  populist policies in the run-up to March 1999 parliamentary
  elections. The government completed restructuring of
  state-controlled Estonian Telecom, the sale of 49% of which will be
  the flagship privatization in 1999 and the largest public equity
  transaction in the Baltics. Estonia expects to join the World Trade
  Organization in 1999.

Economy



Economy--overview: Ethiopia remains one of the least developed
  countries in the world. Its economy is based on agriculture, which
  accounts for more than half of GDP, 90% of exports, and 80% of total
  employment; coffee generates 60% of export earnings. The
  agricultural sector suffers from frequent periods of drought, poor
  cultivation practices, and deterioration of internal security
  conditions. The manufacturing sector is heavily dependent on inputs
  from the agricultural sector. Over 90% of large-scale industry, but
  less than 10% of agriculture, is state-run. The government is
  considering selling off a portion of state-owned plants and is
  implementing reform measures that are gradually liberalizing the
  economy. A major medium-term problem is the improvement of roads,
  water supply, and other parts of an infrastructure badly neglected
  during years of civil strife. Renewed fighting with Eritrea dims
  economic prospects for 1999.

  with a scroll at the bottom bearing the motto DESIRE THE RIGHT



Economy



Economy--overview: The economy was formerly based on agriculture,
  mainly sheep farming, but today fishing contributes the bulk of
  economic activity. In 1987 the government began selling fishing
  licenses to foreign trawlers operating within the Falklands
  exclusive fishing zone. These license fees total more than $40
  million per year, which goes to support the island's health,
  education, and welfare system. Squid accounts for 75% of the fish
  taken. Dairy farming supports domestic consumption; crops furnish
  winter fodder. Exports feature shipments of high-grade wool to the
  UK and the sale of postage stamps and coins. To encourage tourism,
  the Falkland Islands Development Corporation has built three lodges
  for visitors attracted by the abundant wildlife and trout fishing.
  The islands are now self-financing except for defense. The British
  Geological Survey announced a 200-mile oil exploration zone around
  the islands in 1993, and early seismic surveys suggest substantial
  reserves capable of producing 500,000 barrels per day; to date no
  exploitable site has been identified. An agreement between Argentina
  and the UK in 1995 seeks to defuse licensing and sovereignty
  conflicts that would dampen foreign interest in exploiting potential
  oil reserves.

Economy



Economy--overview: After the severe economic troubles of the early
  1990s, brought on by a drop in the vital fish catch, the Faroe
  Islands have come back in the last few years, with unemployment down
  to 5% in mid-1998. Nevertheless the total dependence on fishing
  means the economy remains extremely vulnerable. The Faroese hope to
  broaden their economic base by building new fish-processing plants.
  Oil finds close to the Faroese area give hope for deposits in the
  immediate Faroese area, which may lay the basis for sustained
  economic prosperity. The Faroese are supported by a substantial
  annual subsidy from Denmark.

Economy



Economy--overview: Fiji, endowed with forest, mineral, and fish
  resources, is one of the most developed of the Pacific island
  economies, though still with a large subsistence sector. Sugar
  exports and a growing tourist industry are the major sources of
  foreign exchange. Sugar processing makes up one-third of industrial
  activity. Roughly 250,000 tourists visit each year. Political
  uncertainty and drought, however, contribute to substantial
  fluctuations in earnings from tourism and sugar and to the
  emigration of skilled workers. Fiji's growth slowed in 1997 because
  the sugar industry suffered from low world prices and rent disputes
  between farmers and landowners. Drought in 1998 further damaged the
  sugar industry. Overall growth in 1991-98 has averaged less than 2%
  per year, with long-term problems of low investment and uncertain
  property rights. The central bank predicts growth of 2% to 3% in
  1999.

Introduction



Background: Long ruled by foreign powers, including Sweden and
  the pre-revolutionary Russian Empire, Finland finally declared
  independence in 1917. During World War II, Finland fought the USSR
  twice and then the Germans toward the end of the war. In the
  following half-century, the Finns made a remarkable transformation
  from a farm/forest economy to a diversified modern industrial
  economy. Per capita income has risen to the West European level;
  Finland is a member of the European Union and is the only Nordic
  state to join the euro system at its initiation in January 1999.

Economy



Economy--overview: Finland has a highly industrialized, largely
  free-market economy, with per capita output roughly that of the UK,
  France, Germany, and Italy. Its key economic sector is
  manufacturing--principally the wood, metals, engineering,
  telecommunications, and electronics industries. Trade is important,
  with the export of goods representing about 30% of GDP. Except for
  timber and several minerals, Finland depends on imports of raw
  materials, energy, and some components for manufactured goods.
  Because of the climate, agricultural development is limited to
  maintaining self-sufficiency in basic products. Forestry, an
  important export earner, provides a secondary occupation for the
  rural population. The economy has come back from the recession of
  1990-92, which had been caused by economic overheating, depressed
  foreign markets, and the dismantling of the barter system between
  Finland and the former Soviet Union. Rapidly increasing integration
  with Western Europe--Finland was one of the 11 countries joining the
  euro monetary system (EMU) on 1 January 1999--will dominate the
  economic picture over the next several years. Growth in 1999
  probably will slow, perhaps to 3%, a barrier to any substantial drop
  in unemployment.

Introduction



Background: Although ultimately a victor in World Wars I and II,
  France lost many men, much wealth, its extensive empire, and its
  rank as a dominant nation-state. France has struggled since
  1958--arguably with success--to construct a presidential democracy
  resistant to the severe instabilities inherent in the parliamentary
  democracy of early 20th century France. In recent years, its
  reconciliation and cooperation with Germany have proved central to
  the economic integration of Europe, including the advent of the euro
  in January 1999.

Economy



Economy--overview: One of the four West European trillion-dollar
  economies, France matches a growing services sector with a
  diversified industrial base and substantial agricultural resources.
  Industry generates one-quarter of GDP and more than 80% of export
  earnings. The government retains considerable influence over key
  segments of each sector, with majority ownership of railway,
  electricity, aircraft, and telecommunication firms. It has been
  gradually relaxing its control over these sectors since the early
  1990s. The government is slowly selling off its holdings in France
  Telecom, in Air France, and in the insurance, banking, and defense
  industries. Meanwhile, large tracts of fertile land, the application
  of modern technology, and subsidies have combined to make France the
  leading agricultural producer in Western Europe. A major exporter of
  wheat and dairy products, France is practically self-sufficient in
  agriculture. The economy expanded by 3% in 1998, following a 2.3%
  gain in 1997. Persistently high unemployment still poses a major
  problem for the government. France has shied away from cutting
  exceptionally generous social welfare benefits or the enormous state
  bureaucracy, preferring to pare defense spending and raise taxes to
  keep the deficit down. The JOSPIN administration has pledged both to
  lower unemployment and trim spending, pinning its hopes for new jobs
  on economic growth and on legislation to gradually reduce the
  workweek from 39 to 35 hours by 2002. France joined 10 other EU
  members to launch the euro on 1 January 1999.

Economy



Economy--overview: The economy is tied closely to that of France
  through subsidies and imports. Besides the French space center at
  Kourou, fishing and forestry are the most important economic
  activities, with exports of fish and fish products (mostly shrimp)
  accounting for more than 60% of total revenue in 1992. The large
  reserves of tropical hardwoods, not fully exploited, support an
  expanding sawmill industry which provides sawn logs for export.
  Cultivation of crops is limited to the coastal area, where the
  population is largely concentrated; sugar cane is the major cash
  crop. French Guiana is heavily dependent on imports of food and
  energy. Unemployment is a serious problem, particularly among
  younger workers.

Economy



Economy--overview: Gabon enjoys a per capita income four times
  that of most nations of sub-Saharan Africa. This has supported a
  sharp decline in extreme poverty; yet because of high income
  inequality a large proportion of the population remains poor. Gabon
  depended on timber and manganese until oil was discovered offshore
  in the early 1970s. The oil sector now accounts for 50% of GDP.
  Gabon continues to face fluctuating prices for its oil, timber,
  manganese, and uranium exports. Despite the abundance of natural
  wealth, the economy is hobbled by poor fiscal management. In 1992,
  the fiscal deficit widened to 2.4% of GDP, and Gabon failed to
  settle arrears on its bilateral debt, leading to a cancellation of
  rescheduling agreements with official and private creditors.
  Devaluation of its Francophone currency by 50% on 12 January 1994
  sparked a one-time inflationary surge, to 35%; the rate dropped to
  6% in 1996. The IMF provided a one-year standby arrangement in
  1994-95 and a three-year Enhanced Financing Facility (EFF) at near
  commercial rates beginning in late 1995. Those agreements mandate
  progress in privatization and fiscal discipline. France provided
  additional financial support in January 1997 after Gabon had met IMF
  targets for mid-1996. In 1997, an IMF mission to Gabon criticized
  the government for overspending on off-budget items, overborrowing

Economy



Economy--overview: The Gambia has no important mineral or other
  natural resources and has a limited agricultural base. About 75% of
  the population depends on crops and livestock for its livelihood.
  Small-scale manufacturing activity features the processing of
  peanuts, fish, and hides. Reexport trade normally constitutes a
  major segment of economic activity, but the 50% devaluation of the
  CFA franc in January 1994 made Senegalese goods more competitive and
  hurt the reexport trade. The Gambia has benefited from a rebound in
  tourism after its decline in response to the military's takeover in
  July 1994. Short-run economic progress remains highly dependent on
  sustained bilateral and multilateral aid and on responsible
  government economic management as forwarded by IMF technical help
  and advice.

Introduction



Background: The Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles on Interim
  Self-Government Arrangements ("the DOP"), signed in Washington on 13
  September 1993, provides for a transitional period not exceeding
  five years of Palestinian interim self-government in the Gaza Strip
  and the West Bank. Permanent status negotiations began on 5 May
  1996, but have not resumed since the initial meeting. Under the DOP,
  Israel agreed to transfer certain powers and responsibilities to the
  Palestinian Authority, which includes a Palestinian Legislative
  Council elected in January 1996, as part of interim self-governing
  arrangements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. A transfer of powers
  and responsibilities for the Gaza Strip and Jericho took place
  pursuant to the Israel-PLO 4 May 1994 Cairo Agreement on the Gaza
  Strip and the Jericho Area and in additional areas of the West Bank
  pursuant to the Israel-PLO 28 September 1995 Interim Agreement, the
  Israel-PLO 15 January 1997 Protocol Concerning Redeployment in
  Hebron, and the Israel-PLO 23 October 1998 Wye River Memorandum. The
  DOP provides that Israel will retain responsibility during the
  transitional period for external security and for internal security
  and public order of settlements and Israelis. Permanent status is to
  be determined through direct negotiations.

Economy



Economy--overview: Economic conditions in the Gaza Strip?under the
  responsibility of the Palestinian Authority since the Cairo
  Agreement of May 1994--have deteriorated since the early 1990s. Real
  per capita GDP for the West Bank and Gaza Strip (WBGS) declined 36%
  between 1992 and 1996 owing to the combined effect of falling
  aggregate incomes and robust population growth. The downturn in
  economic activity was largely the result of Israeli closure
  policies--the imposition of generalized border closures in response
  to security incidents in Israel--which disrupted previously
  established labor and commodity market relationships between Israel
  and the WBGS. The most serious negative social effect of this
  downturn has been the emergence of chronic unemployment; average
  unemployment rates in the WBGS during the 1980s were generally under
  5%, by the mid-1990s this level had risen to over 20%. Since 1997
  Israel's use of comprehensive closures has decreased and, in 1998,
  Israel implemented new policies to reduce the impact of closures and
  other security procedures on the movement of Palestinian goods and
  labor. These positive changes to the conduct of economic activity,
  combined with international donor pledges of over $3 billion made to
  the Palestinian Authority in November, may fuel a moderate economic
  recovery in 1999.

  has been dormant since spring 1994, but sporadic violence continues
  between Abkhaz forces and Georgian partisans in western Georgia.
  Russian peacekeepers are deployed in both regions and a UN Observer
  Mission is operating in Abkhazia. As a result of these conflicts,
  Georgia still has about 250,000 internally displaced people. In
  1995, Georgia adopted a new constitution and conducted generally
  free and fair nationwide presidential and parliamentary elections.
  In 1996, the government focused its attention on implementing an
  ambitious economic reform program and professionalizing its
  parliament. Violence and organized crime were sharply curtailed in
  1995 and 1996, but corruption remains rife. Georgia has taken some
  steps to reduce its dependence on Russia, acquiring coastal patrol
  boats in 1997 to replace Russian border units along the Black Sea
  coast. In 1998, Georgia assumed control of its Black Sea coast and
  about half of its land border with Turkey in line with a June 1998
  agreement with Russia. Since 1997, Georgia's parliament has
  sharpened its rhetoric against Russia's continued military presence
  on Georgian territory. In February 1998 an assassination attempt was
  made against President SHEVARDNADZE by supporters of the late former
  president Zviad GAMSAKHURDIA. In October 1998, a disaffected
  military officer led a failed mutiny in western Georgia; the armed
  forces continue to feel the ripple effect of the uprising. Georgia
  faces parliamentary elections this fall, and presidential elections
  next spring. After two years of robust growth, the economy, hurt by
  the financial crisis in Russia, slowed in 1998.

Economy



Economy--overview: Georgia's economy has traditionally revolved
  around Black Sea tourism; cultivation of citrus fruits, tea, and
  grapes; mining of manganese and copper; and output of a small
  industrial sector producing wine, metals, machinery, chemicals, and
  textiles. The country imports the bulk of its energy needs,
  including natural gas and oil products. Its only sizable internal
  energy resource is hydropower. Despite the severe damage the economy
  has suffered due to civil strife, Georgia, with the help of the IMF
  and World Bank, made substantial economic gains since 1995,
  increasing GDP growth and slashing inflation. The Georgian economy
  suffered some setbacks in late 1998, including a large budget
  deficit due to a failure to collect tax revenue and to the impact of
  the Russian economic crisis. Georgia also still suffers from energy
  shortages; it privatized the distribution network in 1998, and
  deliveries are steadily improving. Georgia is pinning its hopes for
  long-term recovery on the development of an international
  transportation corridor through the key Black Sea ports of P'ot'i
  and Bat'umi. The construction of a Caspian oil pipeline through
  Georgia--scheduled to open in early 1999--should spur greater Western
  investment in the economy. The global economic slowdown, a growing
  trade deficit, continuing problems with corruption, and political
  uncertainties cloud the short-term economic picture.

Introduction



Background: Germany--first united in 1871?suffered defeats in
  successive world wars and was occupied by the victorious Allied
  powers of the US, UK, France, and the Soviet Union in 1945. With the
  beginning of the Cold War and increasing tension between the US and
  Soviet Union, two German states were formed in 1949: the western
  Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and the eastern German Democratic
  Republic (GDR). The newly democratic FRG embedded itself in key
  Western economic and security organizations, the EU and NATO, while
  the Communist GDR was on the front line of the Soviet-led Warsaw
  Pact. The decline of the Soviet Union and end of the Cold War
  cleared the path for the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and German
  re-unification in 1990. Germany has expended considerable
  funds--roughly $100 billion a year--in subsequent years working to
  bring eastern productivity and wages up to western standards, with
  mixed results. Unemployment--which in the east is nearly double that
  in the west--has grown over the last several years, primarily as a
  result of structural problems like an inflexible labor market. In
  January 1999, Germany and 10 other members of the EU formed a common
  European currency, the euro, and the German government is now
  looking toward reform of the EU budget and enlargement of the Union
  into Central Europe.

Economy



Economy--overview: Germany possesses the world's third most
  powerful economy, with its capitalist market system tempered by
  generous welfare benefits. On 1 January 1999, Germany and 10 other
  European Union countries launched the European Monetary Union (EMU)
  by permanently fixing their bilateral exchange rates and giving the
  new European Central Bank control over the zone's monetary policy.
  Germans expect to have the new European currency, the euro, in
  pocket by 2002. Domestic demand contributed to a moderate economic
  upswing in early 1998, although unemployment remains high.
  Job-creation measures have helped superficially, but structural
  rigidities--like high wages and costly benefits--make unemployment a
  long-term, not just a cyclical, problem. Although minimally affected
  by the Asian crisis in 1998, Germany revised its 1999 forecast
  downward at the beginning of the year to reflect anticipated effects
  from the global economic slowdown. Over the long term, Germany faces
  budgetary problems--lower tax revenues and higher pension outlays--as
  its population ages. Meanwhile, the German nation continues to
  wrestle with the integration of eastern Germany, whose adjustment
  may take decades to complete despite annual transfers from the west
  of roughly $100 billion a year.

Economy



Economy--overview: Well endowed with natural resources, Ghana has
  twice the per capita output of the poorer countries in West Africa.
  Even so, Ghana remains heavily dependent on international financial
  and technical assistance. Gold, timber, and cocoa production are
  major sources of foreign exchange. The domestic economy continues to
  revolve around subsistence agriculture, which accounts for 41% of
  GDP and employs 60% of the work force, mainly small landholders. In
  1995-97, Ghana made mixed progress under a three-year structural
  adjustment program in cooperation with the IMF. On the minus side,
  public sector wage increases and regional peacekeeping commitments
  have led to continued inflationary deficit financing, depreciation
  of the cedi, and rising public discontent with Ghana's austerity
  measures. Power shortages also helped slow growth in 1998.

Economy



Economy--overview: Gibraltar benefits from an extensive shipping
  trade, offshore banking, and its position as an international
  conference center. The British military presence has been sharply
  reduced and now contributes about 11% to the local economy. The
  financial sector accounts for 15% of GDP; tourism (more than 5
  million visitors in 1995), shipping services fees, and duties on
  consumer goods also generate revenue. Because more than 70% of the
  economy is in the public sector, changes in government spending have
  a major impact on the level of employment.

Economy



Economy--overview: Greece has a mixed capitalist economy with the
  public sector accounting for about half of GDP, although the
  government plans to privatize some leading state enterprises.
  Tourism is a key industry, providing a large portion of GDP and
  foreign exchange earnings. Greece is a major beneficiary of EU aid,
  equal to about 4% of GDP. The economy has improved steadily over the
  last few years, as the government has tightened policy with the goal
  of qualifying Greece to join the EU's single currency (the euro) in
  2001. In particular, Greece has cut its budget deficit to just over
  2% of GDP and tightened monetary policy, with the result that
  inflation fell below 4% by the end of 1998--the lowest rate in 26
  years. The outlook for 1999 is good with the budget deficit and
  inflation both expected to decline further, while GDP growth stays
  near 3% and the current account deficit remains below 2% of GDP.

Economy



Economy--overview: Greenland suffered negative economic growth in
  the early 1990s, but since 1993 the economy has improved. The
  Greenland Home Rule Government (GHRG) has pursued a light fiscal
  policy since the late 1980s which has helped create surpluses in the
  public budget and low inflation. Since 1990, Greenland has
  registered a foreign trade deficit following the closure of the last
  remaining lead and zinc mine in 1989. Greenland today is critically
  dependent on fishing and fish exports; the shrimp fishery is by far
  the largest income earner. Despite resumption of several interesting
  hydrocarbon and minerals exploration activities, it will take
  several years before production can materialize. Tourism is the only
  sector offering any near-term potential and even this is limited due
  to a short season and high costs. The public sector, including
  publicly owned enterprises and the municipalities, plays the
  dominant role in Greenland's economy. About half the government
  revenues come from grants from the Danish Government, an important
  supplement of GDP.

Economy



Economy--overview: In this island economy progress in fiscal
  reforms and prudent macroeconomic management have boosted annual
  growth to nearly 5% in 1997-98. The increase in economic activity
  has been led by construction and trade. Tourist facilities are being
  expanded; tourism is the leading foreign exchange earner. Major
  short-term concerns are the rising fiscal deficit and the
  deterioration in the external account balance. Grenada shares a
  common central bank and a common currency with seven other members
  of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS).

Economy



Economy--overview: The economy depends on agriculture, tourism,
  light industry, and services. It also depends on France for large
  subsidies and imports. Tourism is a key industry, with most tourists
  from the US; an increasingly large number of cruise ships visit the
  islands. The traditional sugarcane crop is slowly being replaced by
  other crops, such as bananas (which now supply about 50% of export
  earnings), eggplant, and flowers. Other vegetables and root crops
  are cultivated for local consumption, although Guadeloupe is still
  dependent on imported food, mainly from France. Light industry
  features sugar and rum production. Most manufactured goods and fuel
  are imported. Unemployment is especially high among the young.

Economy



Economy--overview: The economy depends mainly on US military
  spending and on tourist revenue. Over the past 20 years, the tourist
  industry has grown rapidly, creating a construction boom for new
  hotels and the expansion of older ones. More than 1 million tourists
  visit Guam each year. The industry suffered a setback in 1998
  because of the continuing Japanese recession; the Japanese normally
  make up almost 90% of the tourists. Most food and industrial goods
  are imported. Guam faces the problem of building up the civilian
  economic sector to offset the impact of military downsizing.

Economy



Economy--overview: The agricultural sector accounts for one-fourth
  of GDP and two-thirds of exports and employs more than half of the
  labor force. Coffee, sugar, and bananas are the main products.
  Manufacturing and construction account for one-fifth of GDP. Since
  assuming office in January 1996, President ARZU has worked to
  implement a program of economic liberalization and political
  modernization. The signing of the peace accords in December 1996,
  which ended 36 years of civil war, removed a major obstacle to
  foreign investment. In 1998, Hurricane Mitch caused relatively
  little damage to Guatemala compared to its neighbors. Nevertheless,
  growth will be somewhat smaller due to the storm. Remaining
  challenges include increasing government revenues, and negotiating a
  program with the IMF.

  industry, foreign investment remains minimal but is expected to pick
  up in 1999.

Economy



Economy--overview: One of the 20 poorest countries in the world,
  Guinea-Bissau depends mainly on farming and fishing. Cashew crops
  have increased remarkably in recent years, and the country now ranks
  sixth in cashew production. Guinea-Bissau exports fish and seafood
  along with small amounts of peanuts, palm kernels, and timber. Rice
  is the major crop and staple food. However, intermittent fighting
  between Senegalese-backed government troops and a military junta
  destroyed much of the country's infrastructure and caused widespread
  damage to the economy in 1998. Before the war, trade reform and
  price liberalization were the most successful part of the country's
  structural adjustment program under IMF sponsorship. The tightening
  of monetary policy and the development of the private sector had
  also begun to reinvigorate the economy. Inflation dropped sharply in
  the first quarter of 1997. Membership in the WAMU (West African
  Monetary Union), begun in May 1997, was expected to support 5%
  annual growth and contribute to fiscal discipline. Because of high
  costs, the development of petroleum, phosphate, and other mineral
  resources was not a near-term prospect.

Economy



Economy--overview: In 1997, Guyana, one of the poorest countries
  in the Western Hemisphere, posted its sixth straight year of
  economic growth of 5% or better, with the advance led by gold and
  bauxite mining and by sugar growing. Favorable growth factors have
  included expansion in the key agricultural and mining sectors, a
  more favorable atmosphere for business initiative, a more realistic
  exchange rate, a moderate inflation rate, and the continued support
  of international organizations. However, a severe drought and
  political turmoil following the 1997 elections contributed to a
  negative growth rate for 1998. Serious underlying economic problems
  will continue. Electricity has been in short supply and constitutes
  a major barrier to future gains in national output. The government
  must persist in efforts to manage its sizable external debt and
  extend its privatization program.

Economy



Economy--overview: About 75% of the population lives in abject
  poverty. Nearly 70% of all Haitians depend on the agriculture
  sector, which consists mainly of small-scale subsistence farming and
  employs about two-thirds of the economically active work force. The
  country has experienced little job creation since President PREVAL
  took office in February 1996, although the informal economy is
  growing. Failure to reach agreements with international sponsors
  have denied Haiti badly needed budget and development assistance.
  Meeting aid conditions in 1999 will be especially challenging in the
  face of mounting popular criticism of reforms.

@Holy See (Vatican City)
-----------------------





Introduction



Background: Popes in their secular role ruled much of the Italian
  peninsula, including Rome, for about a thousand years, until 1870. A
  dispute between a series of popes and Italy was settled in 1929 by
  treaties that recognized the Vatican City as an independent
  sovereignty and gave Roman Catholicism special status in Italy. The
  US established formal diplomatic relationships with the Vatican in
  1984. Present issues in the Vatican concern the ill health of Pope
  John Paul II, who turns 79 on 20 May 1999, inter-religious dialogue
  and reconciliation, and the adjustment of church doctrine in an era
  of rapid change. About 1 billion people worldwide profess the Roman
  Catholic faith.

Economy



Economy--overview: Prior to Hurricane Mitch in the fall of 1998,
  Honduras had been pursuing a moderate economic reform program and
  had posted strong annual growth numbers. The storm has dramatically
  changed economic forecasts for Honduras, one of the poorest
  countries in Central America and the hardest hit by Mitch. Honduras
  sustained approximately $3 billion in damages and will probably see
  GDP shrink by 2% in 1999 and unemployment rise. Hardest hit was the
  all-important agricultural sector, which is responsible for the
  majority of exports. As a result, the trade deficit is likely to
  balloon in 1999 to $445 million. However, significant aid has helped
  to stabilize the country. In addition, the Paris Club and bilateral
  creditors have offered substantial debt relief, and Tegucigalpa is
  currently under consideration for inclusion in the IMF-World Bank
  Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC). Additional
  financing will be needed to restore the economy to its pre-Mitch
  level.

@Hungary
-------





Introduction



Background: After World War II Hungary became part of
  Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe, and its government and economy were
  refashioned on the communist model. Increased nationalist
  opposition, which culminated in the government's announcement of
  withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact in 1956, led to massive military
  intervention by Moscow and the swift crushing of the revolt. In the
  more open GORBACHEV years, Hungary led the movement to dissolve the
  Warsaw Pact and steadily moved toward multiparty democracy and a
  market-oriented economy. Following the collapse of the USSR in 1991,
  Hungary has developed close political and economic relations with
  western Europe and is now being considered a possible future member
  of the European Union.

Economy



Economy--overview: Hungary has consolidated its March 1995
  stabilization program and undergone enough restructuring to become
  an established market economy. The country appears to have entered a
  period of sustainable growth, gradually falling inflation, and
  stable external balances. The government's main economic priorities
  are to complete structural reforms, particularly the implementation
  of the 1997 pension reform act (the first in the region), taxation
  reform, and planning for comprehensive health care, local government
  finance reform, and the reform of education at all levels. Foreign
  investment has totaled more than $17 billion through 1998. In
  recognition of Hungary's improved macroeconomic situation, all major
  credit-rating agencies listed the country's foreign currency debt
  issuances as investment grade in 1996. The current IMF stand-by
  arrangement expired in February 1998, and Budapest and the IMF agree
  that there is no need to renew it. The OECD welcomed Hungary as a
  member in May 1996, and in December 1997 the EU invited Hungary to
  begin the accession process. Forecasters expect 4%-5% growth in 1999.

Introduction



Background: Iceland boasts the oldest surviving parliament in the
  world, the Althing, established in 930. Subsequently this Nordic
  island, whose small population has largely depended on fishing and
  sheep-herding for a living, came under the rule of Norway and then
  Denmark. It gained home rule in 1874 and full independence in 1944.
  Literacy, longevity, and social cohesion are topnotch by world
  standards. Tensions continue with Norway, Russia, and other nearby
  countries over fishing rights in the North Atlantic and adjacent
  seas.

Economy



Economy--overview: Iceland's Scandinavian-type economy is
  basically capitalistic, yet with an extensive welfare system, low
  unemployment, and remarkably even distribution of income. The
  economy depends heavily on the fishing industry, which provides 75%
  of export earnings and employs 12% of the work force. In the absence
  of other natural resources--except energy--Iceland's economy is
  vulnerable to changing world fish prices. The economy remains
  sensitive to declining fish stocks as well as to drops in world
  prices for its main exports: fish and fish products, aluminum, and
  ferrosilicon. The center-right government plans to continue its
  policies of reducing the budget and current account deficits,
  limiting foreign borrowing, containing inflation, revising
  agricultural and fishing policies, diversifying the economy, and
  privatizing state-owned industries. The government remains opposed
  to EU membership, primarily because of Icelanders' concern about
  losing control over their fishing resources. Iceland's economy has
  been diversifying into manufacturing and service industries in the
  last decade, and new developments in software production,
  biotechnology, and financial services are taking place. The tourism
  sector is also expanding, with the recent trends in ecotourism and
  whale-watching. Growth is likely to slow in 1999, to a still
  respectable 4.6%.

Economy



Economy--overview: India's economy encompasses traditional village
  farming, modern agriculture, handicrafts, a wide range of modern
  industries, and a multitude of support services. 67% of India's
  labor force work in agriculture, which contributes 25% of the
  country's GDP. Production, trade, and investment reforms since 1991
  have provided new opportunities for Indian businesspersons and an
  estimated 300 million middle class consumers. New Delhi has avoided
  debt rescheduling, attracted foreign investment, and revived
  confidence in India's economic prospects since 1991. Many of the
  country's fundamentals--including savings rates (26% of GDP) and
  reserves (now about $30 billion)--are healthy. Even so, the Indian
  Government needs to restore the early momentum of reform, especially
  by continuing reductions in the extensive remaining government
  regulations. India's exports, currency, and foreign institutional
  investment were affected by the East Asian crisis in late 1997 and
  1998; but capital account controls, a low ratio of short-term debt
  to reserves, and enhanced supervision of the financial sector helped
  insulate it from near term balance-of-payments problems. Exports
  fell 5% in 1998 mainly because of the fall in Asian currencies
  relative to the rupee. Energy, telecommunications, and
  transportation bottlenecks continue to constrain growth. A series of
  weak coalition governments have lacked the political strength to
  push reforms forward to address these and other problems. Indian
  think tanks project GDP growth of about 4.5% in 1999. Inflation will
  remain a worrisome problem.

Economy



Economy--overview: The Indian Ocean provides major sea routes
  connecting the Middle East, Africa, and East Asia with Europe and
  the Americas. It carries a particularly heavy traffic of petroleum
  and petroleum products from the oilfields of the Persian Gulf and
  Indonesia. Its fish are of great and growing importance to the
  bordering countries for domestic consumption and export. Fishing
  fleets from Russia, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan also exploit the
  Indian Ocean, mainly for shrimp and tuna. Large reserves of
  hydrocarbons are being tapped in the offshore areas of Saudi Arabia,
  Iran, India, and western Australia. An estimated 40% of the world's
  offshore oil production comes from the Indian Ocean. Beach sands
  rich in heavy minerals and offshore placer deposits are actively
  exploited by bordering countries, particularly India, South Africa,
  Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.

  issues include implementing IMF-mandated reforms (particularly
  restructuring and recapitalizing the insolvent banking sector),
  effecting a transition to a popularly elected government, addressing
  longstanding grievances over the role of the ethnic Chinese business
  class and charges of cronyism and corruption, alleged human rights
  violations by the military, the role of the military and religion in
  politics, and growing pressures for some form of independence or
  autonomy by Aceh, Irian Jaya, and East Timor.

Economy



Economy--overview: The collapse of the rupiah in late 1997 and
  early 1998 caused GDP to contract by an estimated 13.7% in 1998
  because of Indonesian firms' reliance on short-term
  dollar-denominated debt and high levels of nonperforming loans in
  the banking sector. The Indonesian Government initially wavered on
  meeting the conditions it agreed to in exchange for a $42 billion
  IMF assistance package, contributing to further loss in investor
  confidence and outflows of capital. Riots that in many cases
  targeted ethnic Chinese business owners also set back chances that
  Indonesia would quickly stabilize its financial crisis and
  contributed to President SOEHARTO's resignation on 21 May 1998. His
  successor, B.J. HABIBIE, improved cooperation with the IMF. The
  money supply--which expanded rapidly early in the year to prop up
  banks hit by deposit runs--was tightened within a few months, and by
  October, inflation--which reached a 77% annual rate--was significantly
  dampened. The government also announced a bank recapitalization
  program in late 1998, but by early 1999 the plan faced growing
  challenges over its reliance on public funds. Doubts about whether
  the program is adequate underlie forecasts of continued--although
  much less severe--GDP contraction for 1999. Signs of spreading unrest
  and sectarian violence and concern that social instability will
  increase as the 7 June 1999 national election approaches also
  contribute to pessimism about the economy, particularly because
  foreign investors remain reluctant to begin to increase capital
  inflows again. The next government will face the challenge of
  establishing a macroeconomic policy framework that addresses
  longstanding grievances and inequities underlying much of the
  current unrest without hampering an economic recovery.

Economy



Economy--overview: Iran's economy is a mixture of central
  planning, state ownership of oil and other large enterprises,
  village agriculture, and small-scale private trading and service
  ventures. President KHATAMI has continued to follow the market
  reform plans of former President RAFSANJANI and has indicated that
  he will pursue diversification of Iran's oil-reliant economy
  although he has made little progress toward that goal. In the early
  1990s, Iran experienced a financial crisis and was forced to
  reschedule $15 billion in debt. The strong oil market in 1996 helped
  ease financial pressures on Iran and allowed for Tehran's timely
  debt service payments. Iran's financial situation tightened in 1997
  and deteriorated further in 1998 because of lower oil prices. As a
  result Iran has begun to cut imports and fall into arrears on its
  debt payments.

  occupies two islands in the Persian Gulf claimed by the UAE: Lesser
  Tunb (called Tunb as Sughra in Arabic by UAE and Jazireh-ye Tonb-e
  Kuchek in Persian by Iran) and Greater Tunb (called Tunb al Kubra in
  Arabic by UAE and Jazireh-ye Tonb-e Bozorg in Persian by Iran); it
  jointly administers with the UAE an island in the Persian Gulf
  claimed by the UAE (called Abu Musa in Arabic by UAE and Jazireh-ye
  Abu Musa in Persian by Iran)--over which Iran has taken steps to
  exert unilateral control since 1992, including access restrictions
  and a military build-up on the island; the UAE has garnered
  significant diplomatic support in the region in protesting these
  Iranian actions; Caspian Sea boundaries are not yet determined among
  Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Turkmenistan

Illicit drugs: despite substantial interdiction efforts, Iran
  remains a key transshipment point for Southwest Asian heroin to
  Europe; domestic consumption of narcotics remains a persistent
  problem and Iranian press reports estimate that there are at least
  1.2 million drug users in the country

Introduction



Background: Iraq lies in the lower part of the Tigris-Euphrates
  valley, the heart of one of the four great ancient civilizations.
  The area was overrun by Arab, Mongol, and Turkish conquerors and
  became a British mandate following World War I. Independence came in
  1932. Iraq's pro-Western stance ended in 1958 with the overthrow of
  the monarchy. Its subsequent turbulent history has witnessed the
  dictatorship of SADDAM Husayn, civil war with the Kurds, a bloody
  conflict with neighboring Iran, and, in 1990, an invasion of Kuwait,
  swiftly turned back by a Western coalition led by the US.
  Noncooperation with UN Security Council resolution obligations and
  the UN's inspection of Iraq's nuclear, chemical, biological, and
  long-range missile weapons programs remain major problems.

Economy



Economy--overview: Iraq's economy has been dominated by the oil
  sector, which has traditionally provided about 95% of foreign
  exchange earnings. In the 1980s, financial problems caused by
  massive expenditures in the eight-year war with Iran and damage to
  oil export facilities by Iran led the government to implement
  austerity measures, borrow heavily, and later reschedule foreign
  debt payments; Iraq suffered economic losses of at least $100
  billion from the war. After the end of hostilities in 1988, oil
  exports gradually increased with the construction of new pipelines
  and restoration of damaged facilities. Iraq's seizure of Kuwait in
  August 1990, subsequent international economic embargoes, and
  military action by an international coalition beginning in January
  1991 drastically reduced economic activity and increased prices. The
  Iraqi Government has been unwilling to abide by UN resolutions so
  that the economic embargo could be removed. The government's
  policies of supporting large military and internal security forces
  and of allocating resources to key supporters of the regime have
  exacerbated shortages. The implementation of the UN's oil-for-food
  program in December 1996 has helped improve economic conditions. For
  the first three six-month phases of the program, Iraq was allowed to
  export $2 billion worth of oil in exchange for food, medicine, and
  other humanitarian goods. The UN allowed Iraq to export $5.2 billion
  of oil beginning with the fourth phase of the program in May 1998.
  At an average volume of 1.9 million barrels per day during the last
  half of 1998, oil exports are about three-quarters their prewar
  level. Per capita food imports have increased significantly, while
  medical supplies and health care services are steadily improving.
  Per capita output and living standards are still well below the
  prewar level, but any estimates have a wide range of error.

Introduction



Background: Growing Irish nationalism resulted in independence
  from the United Kingdom in 1921, with six largely Protestant
  northern counties remaining within the UK. After World War II bloody
  strife between Catholics and Protestants over the status of Northern
  Ireland cost thousands of lives. In 1998, substantial steps toward
  peace were agreed to by the British and Irish governments and the
  Roman Catholics and Protestants of Northern Ireland.

Economy



Economy--overview: Ireland is a small, modern, trade-dependent
  economy with growth averaging 9.5% in 1995-98. Agriculture, once the
  most important sector, is now dwarfed by industry, which accounts
  for 39% of GDP, about 80% of exports, and employs 28% of the labor
  force. Although exports remain the primary engine for Ireland's
  robust growth, the economy is also benefiting from a rise in
  consumer spending and recovery in both construction and business
  investment. Over the past decade, the Irish government has
  implemented a series of national economic programs designed to curb
  inflation, reduce government spending, and promote foreign
  investment. Although the unemployment rate has been halved, it
  remains high, and job creation is a primary concern of government
  policy. Recent efforts have concentrated on improving workers
  qualifications and the education system. Ireland joined in launching
  the euro currency system in January 1999 along with 10 other EU
  nations.

  Aviv

Administrative divisions: 6 districts (mehozot, singular--mehoz);
  Central, Haifa, Jerusalem, Northern, Southern, Tel Aviv

Independence: 14 May 1948 (from League of Nations mandate under
  British administration)

National holiday: Independence Day, 14 May 1948; note--Israel
  declared independence on 14 May 1948, but the Jewish calendar is
  lunar and the holiday may occur in April or May

Constitution: no formal constitution; some of the functions of a
  constitution are filled by the Declaration of Establishment (1948),
  the basic laws of the parliament (Knesset), and the Israeli
  citizenship law

  regulations, and, in personal matters, Jewish, Christian, and Muslim
  legal systems; in December 1985, Israel informed the UN Secretariat

  prime minister; under the new law, each voter casts two ballots--one
  for the direct election of the prime minister and one for the party
  in the Knesset; the candidate that receives the largest percentage
  of the popular vote then works to form a coalition with other
  parties to achieve a parliamentary majority of 61 seats; finally,
  the candidate must submit his or her cabinet to the Knesset for
  approval and this must be done within 45 days of the election; in
  contrast to the old system, under the new law, the prime minister's
  party need not be the single-largest party in the Knesset

Economy



Economy--overview: Israel has a technologically advanced market
  economy with substantial government participation. It depends on
  imports of crude oil, grains, raw materials, and military equipment.
  Despite limited natural resources, Israel has intensively developed
  its agricultural and industrial sectors over the past 20 years.
  Manufacturing and construction employ about 28% of Israeli workers;
  agriculture, forestry, and fishing 2.6%; and services the rest.
  Israel is largely self-sufficient in food production except for
  grains. Diamonds, high-technology equipment, and agricultural
  products (fruits and vegetables) are leading exports. Israel usually
  posts sizable current account deficits, which are covered by large
  transfer payments from abroad and by foreign loans. Roughly half of
  the government's external debt is owed to the US, which is its major
  source of economic and military aid. The influx of Jewish immigrants
  from the former USSR topped 750,000 during the period 1989-98,
  bringing the population of Israel from the former Soviet Union to
  one million, one-sixth of the total population and adding scientific
  and professional expertise of substantial value for the economy's
  future. The influx, coupled with the opening of new markets at the
  end of the Cold War, energized Israel's economy, which grew rapidly
  in the early 1990s. But growth began slowing in 1996 when the
  government imposed tighter fiscal and monetary policies and the
  immigration bonus petered out.

@Italy
-----





Introduction



Background: Italy failed to secure political unification until
  the 1860s, thus lacking the military and imperial power of Spain,
  Britain, and France. The fascist dictatorship of MUSSOLINI after
  World War I, led to the disastrous alliance with HITLER's Germany
  and defeat in World War II. Italy was a founding member of the
  European Economic Community (EEC) and joined in the growing
  political and economic unification of Western Europe, including the
  introduction of the euro in January 1999. On-going problems include
  illegal immigration, the ravages of organized crime, high
  unemployment, and the low incomes and technical standards of
  Southern Italy compared with the North.

Economy



Economy--overview: Since World War II, the Italian economy has
  changed from one based on agriculture into a ranking industrial
  economy, with approximately the same total and per capita output as
  France and the UK. This basically capitalistic economy is still
  divided into a developed industrial north, dominated by private
  companies, and a less developed agricultural south, with large
  public enterprises and more than 20% unemployment. Most raw
  materials needed by industry and over 75% of energy requirements
  must be imported. In the second half of 1992, Rome became unsettled
  by the prospect of not qualifying to participate in EU plans for
  economic and monetary union later in the decade; thus, it finally
  began to address its huge fiscal imbalances. Subsequently, the
  government has adopted fairly stringent budgets, abandoned its
  inflationary wage indexation system, and started to scale back its
  generous social welfare programs, including pension and health care
  benefits. In December 1998, Italy adopted a budget compliant with
  the requirements of the European Monetary Union (EMU);
  representatives of government, labor, and employers agreed to an
  update of the 1993 "social pact," which has been widely credited
  with having brought Italy's inflation into conformity with EMU
  requirements. In 1999, Italy must adjust to the loss of an
  independent monetary policy, which it has used quite liberally in
  the past to help cope with external shocks. Italy also must work to
  stimulate employment, promote wage flexibility, and tackle the
  informal economy.

Economy



Economy--overview: Key sectors in this island economy are bauxite
  (alumina and bauxite account for more than half of exports) and
  tourism. Since assuming office in 1992, Prime Minister PATTERSON has
  eliminated most price controls, streamlined tax schedules, and
  privatized government enterprises. Continued tight monetary and
  fiscal policies have helped slow inflation--although inflationary
  pressures are mounting--and stabilize the exchange rate, but have
  resulted in the slowdown of economic growth (moving from 1.5% in
  1992 to 0.5% in 1995). In 1996, GDP showed negative growth (-1.4%)
  and remained negative through 1998. Serious problems include: high
  interest rates; increased foreign competition; the weak financial
  condition of business in general resulting in receiverships or
  closures and downsizings of companies; the shift in investment
  portfolios to non-productive, short-term high yield instruments; a
  pressured, sometimes sliding, exchange rate; a widening merchandise
  trade deficit; and a growing internal debt for government bailouts
  to various ailing sectors of the economy, particularly the financial
  sector. Jamaica's medium-term prospects will depend upon encouraging
  investment in the productive sectors, maintaining a competitive
  exchange rate, stabilizing the labor environment, selling off
  reacquired firms, and implementing proper fiscal and monetary
  policies.

Economy



Economy--overview: Government-industry cooperation, a strong work
  ethic, mastery of high technology, and a comparatively small defense
  allocation (1% of GDP) have helped Japan advance with extraordinary
  rapidity to the rank of second most powerful economy in the world.
  One notable characteristic of the economy is the working together of
  manufacturers, suppliers, and distributors in closely knit groups
  called keiretsu. A second basic feature has been the guarantee of
  lifetime employment for a substantial portion of the urban labor
  force; this guarantee is eroding. Industry, the most important
  sector of the economy, is heavily dependent on imported raw
  materials and fuels. The much smaller agricultural sector is highly
  subsidized and protected, with crop yields among the highest in the
  world. Usually self-sufficient in rice, Japan must import about 50%
  of its requirements of other grain and fodder crops. Japan maintains
  one of the world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly
  15% of the global catch. For three decades overall real economic
  growth had been spectacular: a 10% average in the 1960s, a 5%
  average in the 1970s, and a 4% average in the 1980s. Growth slowed
  markedly in 1992-95 largely because of the aftereffects of
  overinvestment during the late 1980s and contractionary domestic
  policies intended to wring speculative excesses from the stock and
  real estate markets. Growth picked up to 3.9% in 1996, largely a
  reflection of stimulative fiscal and monetary policies as well as
  low rates of inflation. But in 1997-98 Japan experienced a wrenching
  recession, centered about financial difficulties in the banking
  system and real estate markets and exacerbated by rigidities in
  corporate structures and labor markets. In early 1999 output has
  started to stabilize as emergency government spending begins to take
  hold. The crowding of habitable land area and the aging of the
  population are two major long-run problems.

Economy



Economy--overview: The economy is based largely on financial
  services, agriculture, and tourism. Potatoes, cauliflower, tomatoes,
  and especially flowers are important export crops, shipped mostly to
  the UK. The Jersey breed of dairy cattle is known worldwide and
  represents an important export earner. Milk products go to the UK
  and other EU countries. In 1996 the finance sector accounted for
  about 60% of the island's output. Tourism, another mainstay of the
  economy, accounts for 24% of GDP. In recent years, the government
  has encouraged light industry to locate in Jersey, with the result
  that an electronics industry has developed alongside the traditional
  manufacturing of knitwear. All raw material and energy requirements
  are imported, as well as a large share of Jersey's food needs. Light
  tax and death duties make the island a popular tax haven.

Economy



Economy--overview: Jordan is a small Arab country with inadequate
  supplies of water and other natural resources such as oil and coal.
  Jordan benefited from increased Arab aid during the oil boom of the
  late 1970s and early 1980s, when its annual real GNP growth averaged
  more than 10%. In the remainder of the 1980s, however, reductions in
  both Arab aid and worker remittances slowed real economic growth to
  an average of roughly 2% per year. Imports--mainly oil, capital
  goods, consumer durables, and food--outstripped exports, with the
  difference covered by aid, remittances, and borrowing. In mid-1989,
  the Jordanian Government began debt-rescheduling negotiations and
  agreed to implement an IMF-supported program designed to gradually
  reduce the budget deficit and implement badly needed structural
  reforms. The Persian Gulf crisis that began in August 1990, however,
  aggravated Jordan's already serious economic problems, forcing the
  government to shelve the IMF program, stop most debt payments, and
  suspend rescheduling negotiations. Aid from Gulf Arab states, worker
  remittances, and trade contracted; and refugees flooded the country,
  producing serious balance-of-payments problems, stunting GDP growth,
  and straining government resources. The economy rebounded in 1992,
  largely due to the influx of capital repatriated by workers
  returning from the Gulf, but recovery was uneven. A preliminary
  agreement with the IMF in early 1999 will provide new loans over the
  next three years. Sluggish growth, along with debt, poverty, and
  unemployment are fundamental ongoing economic problems.

Introduction



Background: As a republic within the USSR (1920-91), Kazakhstan
  suffered greatly from Stalinist purges, from environmental damage,
  and saw the ethnic Russian portion of its population rise to 37%
  while other non-Kazakhs made up almost 20%. Current issues include
  the pace of market reform and privatization; fair and free elections
  and democratic reform; ethnic differences between Russians and
  Kazakhs; environmental problems; and how to convert the country's
  abundant energy resources into a better standard of living.

  found throughout the country and pose health risks for humans and
  animals; industrial pollution is severe in some cities; because the
  two main rivers which flowed into the Aral Sea have been diverted
  for irrigation, it is drying up and leaving behind a harmful layer
  of chemical pesticides and natural salts; these substances are then
  picked up by the wind and blown into noxious dust storms; pollution
  in the Caspian Sea; soil pollution from overuse of agricultural
  chemicals and salination from faulty irrigation practices

Economy



Economy--overview: Kazakhstan, the second largest of the former
  Soviet republics in territory, possesses enormous untapped fossil
  fuel reserves as well as plentiful supplies of other minerals and
  metals. It also has considerable agricultural potential with its
  vast steppe lands accommodating both livestock and grain production.
  Kazakhstan's industrial sector rests on the extraction and
  processing of these natural resources and also on a relatively large
  machine building sector specializing in construction equipment,
  tractors, agricultural machinery, and some defense items. The
  breakup of the USSR and the collapse of demand for Kazakhstan's
  traditional heavy industry products have resulted in a sharp
  contraction of the economy since 1991, with the steepest annual
  decline occurring in 1994. In 1995-97 the pace of the government
  program of economic reform and privatization quickened, resulting in
  a substantial shifting of assets into the private sector. The
  December 1996 signing of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium agreement
  to build a new pipeline from western Kazakhstan's Tengiz oil field
  to the Black Sea increases prospects for substantially larger oil
  exports in several years. Kazakhstan's economy turned downward in
  1998 with a 2.5% decline in GDP growth due to slumping oil prices
  and the August financial crisis in Russia. 1999 will also be a
  difficult year.

Economy



Economy--overview: Since 1993, the government of Kenya has
  implemented a program of economic liberalization and reform. Steps
  have included the removal of import licensing and price controls,
  removal of foreign exchange controls, fiscal and monetary restraint,
  and reduction of the public sector through privatizing publicly
  owned companies and downsizing the civil service. With the support
  of the World Bank, IMF, and other donors, these reforms have led to
  a turnaround in economic performance following a period of negative
  growth in the early 1990s. Kenya's real GDP grew at 5% in 1995 and
  4% in 1996, and inflation remained under control. Growth slowed in
  1997-98. Political violence damaged the tourist industry, and the
  IMF allowed Kenya's Enhanced Structural Adjustment Program to lapse
  due to the government's failure to enact reform conditions and to
  adequately address public sector corruption. Moreover, El Nino rains
  destroyed crops and damaged an already crumbling infrastructure in
  1997 and 1998. Long-term barriers to development include electricity
  shortages, the government's continued and inefficient dominance of
  key sectors, endemic corruption, and the country's high population
  growth rate.

Economy



Economy--overview: A remote country of 33 scattered coral atolls,
  Kiribati has few national resources. Commercially viable phosphate
  deposits were exhausted at the time of independence from the UK in
  1979. Copra and fish now represent the bulk of production and
  exports. The economy has fluctuated widely in recent years. Economic
  development is constrained by a shortage of skilled workers, weak
  infrastructure, and remoteness from international markets. The
  financial sector is at an early stage of development as is the
  expansion of private sector initiatives. Foreign financial aid,
  largely from the UK and Japan, is a critical supplement to GDP,
  equal to 25%-50% of GDP in recent years. Remittances from workers
  abroad account for more than $5 million each year.

@Korea, North

Introduction



Background: At the end of World War II, the US and the Soviet
  Union agreed that US troops would accept the surrender of Japanese
  forces south of the 38th parallel and the Soviet Union would do so
  in the north. In 1948, the UN proposed nationwide elections; after
  P'yongyang's refusal to allow UN inspectors in the north, elections
  were held in the south and the Republic of Korea was established.
  The Democratic People's Republic of Korea was established the
  following month in the north. Communist North Korean forces invaded
  South Korea in 1950. US and other UN forces intervened to defend the
  South and Chinese forces intervened on behalf of the North. After a
  bitter three-year war, an armistice was signed in 1953, establishing
  a military demarcation line near the 38th parallel. The North's
  heavy investment in military forces has produced an army of 1
  million troops equipped with thousands of tanks and artillery
  pieces. Despite growing economic hardships, North Korea continues to
  devote a significant portion of its scarce resources to the military.

Economy



Economy--overview: North Korea is the world's most centrally
  planned economy. Agricultural land is collectivized, state-owned
  industry produces nearly all manufactured goods, and heavy and
  military industries have long been developed at the expense of light
  and consumer industries. Open-air markets since 1995 have gained
  increasing importance in the distribution of food and consumer goods
  but private production remains extremely limited. Total economic
  output has fallen steadily since 1991--perhaps by as much as
  one-half--when the country's economic ties to the Soviet Union and
  Eastern Bloc collapsed. The slide has also been fueled by serious
  energy shortages, aging industrial facilities, and a lack of
  maintenance and new investment. The leadership has tried to maintain
  a high level of military spending but the armed forces have
  nonetheless been affected by the general economic decline. Although
  North Korea has long depended on imports to meet food needs, serious
  fertilizer shortages in recent years have combined with structural
  constraints--such as a shortage of arable land and a short growing
  season--to reduce staple grain output to more than 1 million tons
  below what the country needs to meet even minimal demand. Widespread
  famine and disease have cost the lives of hundreds of thousands of
  North Koreans in 1994-98. The US, China, the international
  community, and nongovernmental organizations have sent aid but the
  problems remain extremely serious.

Introduction



Background: At the end of World War II, the US and the Soviet
  Union agreed that US troops would accept the surrender of Japanese
  forces south of the 38th parallel and the Soviet Union would do so
  in the north. In 1948, the UN proposed nationwide elections; after
  P'yongyang's refusal to allow UN inspectors in the north, elections
  were held in the south and the Republic of Korea was established.
  The Democratic People's Republic of Korea was established the
  following month in the north. Communist North Korean forces invaded
  South Korea in 1950. US and other UN forces intervened to defend the
  South and Chinese forces intervened on behalf of the North. After a
  bitter three-year war, an armistice was signed in 1953, establishing
  a military demarcation line near the 38th parallel. Thereafter,
  South Korea achieved amazing economic growth, with per capita output
  rising to 13 times the level in the North. Since late 1997, however,
  the nation has suffered widespread financial and organizational
  difficulties. Continuing tensions between North and South have
  raised concerns of provocative military actions by the North.

Economy



Economy--overview: As one of the Four Dragons of East Asia, South
  Korea has achieved an incredible record of growth. Three decades ago
  its GDP per capita was comparable with levels in the poorer
  countries of Africa and Asia. Today its GDP per capita is seven
  times India's, 13 times North Korea's, and already near the lesser
  economies of the European Union. This success through the late 1980s
  was achieved by a system of close government business ties,
  including directed credit, import restrictions, sponsorship of
  specific industries, and a strong labor effort. The government
  promoted the import of raw materials and technology at the expense
  of consumer goods and encouraged savings and investment over
  consumption. The Asian financial crisis of 1997-98 exposed certain
  longstanding weaknesses in South Korea's development model,
  including high debt/equity ratios, massive foreign borrowing, and an
  undisciplined financial sector. By the end of 1998 it had recovered
  financial stability, rebuilding foreign exchange reserves to record
  levels by running a current account surplus of $40 billion. As of
  December 1998, the first tentative signs of a rebound in the economy
  emerged, and most forecasters expect GDP growth to turn positive at
  least in the second half of 1999. Seoul has also made a positive
  start on a program to get the country's largest business groups to
  swap subsidiaries to promote specialization, and the administration
  has directed many of the mid-sized conglomerates into debt-workout
  programs with creditor banks. Challenges for the future include
  cutting redundant staff, which reaches 20%-30% at most firms and
  maintaining the impetus for structural reform.

Economy



Economy--overview: Kuwait is a small and relatively open economy
  with proved crude oil reserves of about 94 billion barrels--10% of
  world reserves. Petroleum accounts for nearly half of GDP, 90% of
  export revenues, and 75% of government income. Kuwait lacks water
  and has practically no arable land, thus preventing development of
  agriculture. With the exception of fish, it depends almost wholly on
  food imports. About 75% of potable water must be distilled or
  imported. The economy improved moderately in 1994-97, but in 1998
  suffered from the large decline in world oil prices. The Kuwaiti
  cabinet approved a reform package in January 1999, including
  reducing subsidies and increasing taxes on large consumer goods.
  Nevertheless, Kuwait anticipates continuing budget deficits for the
  next few years. Kuwait is attracting foreign oil companies to
  develop fields in the northern part of the country.

Introduction



Background: A country of incredible natural beauty and proud
  nomadic traditions, Kyrgyzstan became part of the Russian empire in
  1864. In the Czarist and Soviet periods, Russian managers and
  technicians were sent to Kyrgyzstan and have recently made up more
  than one-fifth of the population. Many Russians have been returning
  home since Kyrgyzstan gained its independence in 1991 when the USSR
  collapsed. Privatization of state-owned enterprises, expansion of
  democracy and political freedoms, and inter-ethnic relations are
  current issues.

Economy



Economy--overview: Kyrgyzstan is a small, poor, mountainous
  country with a predominantly agricultural economy. Cotton, wool, and
  meat are the main agricultural products and exports. Industrial
  exports include gold, mercury, uranium, and hydropower. Kyrgyzstan
  has been one of the most progressive countries of the former Soviet
  Union in carrying out market reforms. Following a successful
  stabilization program, which lowered inflation from 88% in 1994 to
  15% for 1997, attention is turning toward stimulating growth. Much
  of the government's stock in enterprises has been sold. Drops in
  production have been severe since the breakup of the Soviet Union in
  December 1991, but by mid-1995 production began to recover and
  exports began to increase. Pensioners, unemployed workers, and
  government workers with salary arrears continue to suffer. Foreign
  assistance played a substantial role in the country's economic
  turnaround in 1996-97. The government has adopted a series of
  measures to combat some of the severe economic problems such as
  excessive debt and inadequate revenue collection, encountered in
  1998.

Economy



Economy--overview: The government of Laos?one of the few remaining
  official communist states--has been decentralizing control and
  encouraging private enterprise since 1986. The results, starting
  from an extremely low base, have been striking--growth averaged 7% in
  1988-96. Because Laos depends heavily on its trade with Thailand, it
  fell victim to the financial crisis in the region beginning in 1997.
  Laos is a landlocked country with a primitive infrastructure. It has
  no railroads, a rudimentary road system, and limited external and
  internal telecommunications. Electricity is available in only a few
  urban areas. Subsistence agriculture accounts for half of GDP and
  provides 80% of total employment. The predominant crop is glutinous
  rice. In non-drought years, Laos is self-sufficient overall in food,
  but each year flood, pests, and localized drought cause shortages in
  various parts of the country. For the foreseeable future the economy
  will continue to depend on aid from the IMF and other international
  sources; Japan is currently the largest bilateral aid donor; aid
  from the former USSR/Eastern Europe has been cut sharply. As in many
  developing countries, deforestation and soil erosion will hamper
  efforts to regain a high rate of GDP growth.

Introduction



Background: Along with most of the other small nations of Europe,
  Latvia shares a history of invasion by a succession of expansionist
  nations, e.g., Sweden, Poland, Germany, and Russia. After a brief
  period of independence between the two World Wars, Latvia was
  annexed by the USSR in 1940 under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. The
  USSR recaptured Latvia from its German occupiers in 1944. Latvia
  reestablished its independence in August 1991, a few months prior to
  the collapse of the Soviet Union; the last Russian troops left in
  1994. The status of ethnic Russians, who make up 30% of the
  population, is an issue of concern to Moscow. Unemployment has
  become a growing problem and Latvia hopes to receive an invitation
  to begin EU accession talks by the end of 1999.

Economy



Economy--overview: Developments in 1998 include an invitation to
  join the World Trade Organization (the first Baltic country
  invited), GDP growth of 3.6% (down from 6% in 1997), and reduced
  inflation at 4.7% (from 8.4% in 1997). The drop in GDP growth is
  largely attributable to the impact of Russia's financial crisis and
  reduced investment in emerging markets following the Asian financial
  troubles. Unofficial sanctions that Russia imposed in the spring
  initially hit Latvia's exporters--Russia is among Latvia's top three
  trade partners--but also prompted them to seek alternative markets.
  Latvia continued its strict fiscal and monetary policy, including
  its second balanced budget and had a 1.8% budget surplus. Its draft
  1999 budget is based on conservative projections of 2% to 4% GDP
  growth and 4.5% inflation. Unemployment climbed to 9.2% in 1998, a
  considerable increase over the 6.7% rate in 1997. Latvia continued
  to have a high current account deficit, estimated at about 9%.
  Privatization of large state utilities--especially the energy
  sector--was postponed and is unlikely to resume before late 1999. EU
  accession remains Latvia's top priority, and Latvia expects to be
  invited to start EU accession talks by the end of 1999. Continued
  troubles in the Russian and East Asian economies probably will hold
  growth to around 2.5% in 1999.

@Lebanon
-------





Introduction



Background: Lebanon has made progress toward rebuilding its
  political institutions and regaining its national sovereignty since
  the end of the devastating 16-year civil war, which ended in 1991.
  Under the Ta'if Accord--the blueprint for national reconciliation--the
  Lebanese have established a more equitable political system,
  particularly by giving Muslims a greater say in the political
  process while institutionalizing sectarian divisions in the
  government. Since the end of the civil war, the Lebanese have formed
  six cabinets, conducted two legislative elections, and held their
  first municipal elections in 35 years. Most of the militias have
  been weakened or disbanded. The Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) has
  seized vast quantities of weapons used by the militias during the
  war and extended central government authority over about one-half of
  the country. Hizballah, the radical Shi'a party, retains its
  weapons. Foreign forces still occupy areas of Lebanon. Israel
  maintains troops in southern Lebanon and continues to support a
  proxy militia, the Army of South Lebanon (ASL), along a narrow
  stretch of territory contiguous to its border. The ASL's enclave
  encompasses this self-declared security zone and about 20 kilometers
  north to the strategic town of Jazzin. Syria maintains about 25,000
  troops in Lebanon based mainly in Beirut, North Lebanon, and the
  Bekaa Valley. Syria's deployment was legitimized by the Arab League
  during Lebanon's civil war and in the Ta'if Accord. Citing the
  continued weakness of the LAF, Beirut's requests, and failure of the
  Lebanese Government to implement all of the constitutional reforms
  in the Ta'if Accord, Damascus has so far refused to withdraw its
  troops from Lebanon.

Economy



Economy--overview: The 1975-91 civil war seriously damaged
  Lebanon's economic infrastructure, cut national output by half, and
  all but ended Lebanon's position as a Middle Eastern entrepot and
  banking hub. Peace has enabled the central government to restore
  control in Beirut, begin collecting taxes, and regain access to key
  port and government facilities. Economic recovery has been helped by
  a financially sound banking system and resilient small- and
  medium-scale manufacturers, with family remittances, banking
  services, manufactured and farm exports, and international aid as
  the main sources of foreign exchange. Lebanon's economy has made
  impressive gains since the launch of "Horizon 2000," the
  government's $20 billion reconstruction program in 1993. Real GDP
  grew 8% in 1994 and 7% in 1995 before Israel's Operation Grapes of
  Wrath in April 1996 stunted economic activity. During 1992-98,
  annual inflation fell from more than 100% to 5%, and foreign
  exchange reserves jumped to more than $6 billion from $1.4 billion.
  Burgeoning capital inflows have generated foreign payments
  surpluses, and the Lebanese pound has remained relatively stable.
  Progress also has been made in rebuilding Lebanon's war-torn
  physical and financial infrastructure. Solidere, a $2-billion firm,
  is managing the reconstruction of Beirut's central business
  district; the stock market reopened in January 1996; and
  international banks and insurance companies are returning. The
  government nonetheless faces serious challenges in the economic
  arena. It has had to fund reconstruction by tapping foreign exchange
  reserves and boosting borrowing. Reducing the government budget
  deficit is a major goal of the LAHUD government. The stalled peace
  process and ongoing violence in southern Lebanon could lead to wider
  hostilities that would disrupt vital capital inflows. Furthermore,
  the gap between rich and poor has widened in the 1990's, resulting
  in grassroots dissatisfaction over the skewed distribution of the
  reconstruction's benefits and leading the government to shift its
  focus from rebuilding infrastructure to improving living conditions.

Economy



Economy--overview: Small, landlocked, and mountainous, Lesotho's
  only important natural resource is water. Its economy is based on
  subsistence agriculture, livestock, and remittances from miners
  employed in South Africa. The number of such mine workers has
  declined steadily over the past several years. In 1996 their
  remittances added about 33% to GDP compared with the addition of
  roughly 67% in 1990. A small manufacturing base depends largely on
  farm products which support the milling, canning, leather, and jute
  industries. Agricultural products are exported primarily to South
  Africa. Proceeds from membership in a common customs union with
  South Africa form the majority of government revenue. Although
  drought has decreased agricultural activity over the past few years,
  completion of a major hydropower facility in January 1998 now
  permits the sale of water to South Africa, generating royalties that
  will be an important source of income for Lesotho. The pace of
  parastatal privatization has increased in recent years. Civil
  disorder in September 1998 destroyed 80% of the commercial
  infrastructure in Maseru and two other major towns. Most firms were
  not covered by insurance, and the rebuilding of small and medium
  business will be a significant challenge in terms of both economic
  growth and employment levels.

Introduction



Background: The 1995 Abuja Peace Accords ended seven years of
  civil warfare in Liberia. More than 20,000 of the estimated 33,000
  factional fighters gave up their arms to the Cease-Fire Monitoring
  Group of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOMOG).
  Free and open presidential and legislative elections were held 19
  July 1997; former faction leader, Charles TAYLOR, and his National
  Patriotic Party won overwhelming victories. The years of civil
  strife coupled with the flight of most business people disrupted
  formal economic activity. A short-lived armed clash in September
  1998 between government forces and supporters of factional leader
  Roosevelt JOHNSON and continuing uncertainty about the security
  situation have slowed the process of rebuilding the social and
  economic structure of the war-torn country. For two centuries the US
  has had uniquely close ties to Liberia and today is a major aid
  donor.

Economy



Economy--overview: A civil war in 1989-97 has destroyed much of
  Liberia's economy, especially the infrastructure in and around
  Monrovia. Many businessmen have fled the country, taking capital and
  expertise with them. Some returned during 1997. Many will not
  return. Richly endowed with water, mineral resources, forests, and a
  climate favorable to agriculture, Liberia had been a producer and
  exporter of basic products, while local manufacturing, mainly
  foreign owned, had been small in scope. The democratically elected
  government, installed in August 1997, inherited massive
  international debts and currently relies on revenues from its
  maritime registry to provide the bulk of its foreign exchange
  earnings. The restoration of the infrastructure and the raising of
  incomes in this ravaged economy depends on the implementation of
  sound macro- and micro-economic policies of the new government,
  including the encouragement of foreign investment.

Economy



Economy--overview: The socialist-oriented economy depends
  primarily upon revenues from the oil sector, which contributes
  practically all export earnings and about one-third of GDP. These
  oil revenues and a small population give Libya one of the highest
  per capita GDPs in Africa, but little of this income flows down to
  the lower orders of society. Low oil prices in 1998 cut back revenue
  sharply, and GDP growth fell by 1%. In this statist society, import
  restrictions and inefficient resource allocations have led to
  periodic shortages of basic goods and foodstuffs. The nonoil
  manufacturing and construction sectors, which account for about 20%
  of GDP, have expanded from processing mostly agricultural products
  to include the production of petrochemicals, iron, steel, and
  aluminum. Agriculture accounts for only 5% of GDP; it employs 18% of
  the labor force. Climatic conditions and poor soils severely limit
  farm output, and Libya imports about 75% of its food requirements.
  The UN sanctions imposed in April 1992 do not have a major impact on
  the economy although they have increased transaction and
  transportation costs.

Economy



Economy--overview: Despite its small size and limited natural
  resources, Liechtenstein has developed into a prosperous, highly
  industrialized, free-enterprise economy with a vital financial
  service sector and living standards on a par with the urban areas of
  its large European neighbors. Low business taxes--the maximum tax
  rate is 18%--and easy incorporation rules have induced about 73,700
  holding or so-called letter box companies to establish nominal
  offices in Liechtenstein, providing 30% of state revenues. The
  country participates in a customs union with Switzerland and uses
  the Swiss franc as its national currency. It imports more than 90%
  of its energy requirements. Liechtenstein is a member of the
  European Economic Area (an organization serving as a bridge between
  European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and EU) since May 1995. The
  government is working to harmonize its economic policies with those
  of an integrated Europe.

Economy



Economy--overview: Lithuania has benefited from its disciplined
  approach to market reform and its adherence to strict fiscal and
  monetary policies imposed by the IMF, measures that have helped
  constrain the growth of the money supply, reduce inflation to 5.1%,
  and support GDP growth of 6% in 1997 and 4.5% in 1998. Foreign
  direct investment and the privatization program maintained their
  momentum in 1998. However, the current account deficit has hovered
  around 8% to 10% of GDP annually since 1995--the result of greater
  demand for consumer goods and falling growth in exports. Reducing
  this deficit is the immediate economic challenge for 1999.

Economy



Economy--overview: The stable, prosperous economy features
  moderate growth, low inflation, and low unemployment. The industrial
  sector, until recently dominated by steel, has become increasingly
  more diversified. During the past decades, growth in the financial
  sector has more than compensated for the decline in steel. Services,
  especially banking, account for a growing proportion of the economy.
  Agriculture is based on small family-owned farms. Luxembourg has
  especially close trade and financial ties to Belgium and the
  Netherlands, and as a member of the EU, enjoys the advantages of the
  open European market. It joined with 10 other EU members to launch
  the euro on 1 January 1999.

Economy



Economy--overview: The breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991 deprived
  Macedonia, its poorest republic, of key protected markets and large
  transfer payments from the center. Worker remittances and foreign
  aid have softened the subsequent volatile recovery period. Continued
  recovery depends on Macedonia's ability to attract investment, to
  redevelop trade ties with Greece and Serbia and Montenegro, and to
  maintain its commitment to economic liberalization. The economy can
  meet its basic food needs but depends on outside sources for all of
  its oil and gas and most of its modern machinery and parts.

Economy



Economy--overview: Madagascar suffers from chronic malnutrition,
  underfunded health and education facilities, a roughly 3% annual
  population growth rate, and severe loss of forest cover, accompanied
  by erosion. Agriculture, including fishing and forestry, is the
  mainstay of the economy, accounting for 32% of GDP and contributing
  more than 70% to export earnings. Industry features textile
  manufacturing and the processing of agricultural products. Growth in
  output in 1992-97 averaged less than the growth rate of the
  population. Growth has been held back by antigovernment strikes and
  demonstrations, a decline in world coffee demand, and the erratic
  commitment of the government to economic reform. Formidable
  obstacles stand in the way of Madagascar's realizing its
  considerable growth potential; the extent of government reforms,
  outside financial aid, and foreign investment will be key
  determinants.

Economy



Economy--overview: After a decade of 8% average GDP growth, the
  Malaysian economy--severely hit by the regional financial
  crisis--declined 7% in 1998. Malaysia will likely remain in recession
  for the first half of 1999; official statistics continue to show
  anemic exports, and some private financial analysts forecast a
  further drop in GDP of 1% in 1999. Prime Minister MAHATHIR has
  imposed capital controls to protect the local currency while cutting
  interest rates to stimulate the economy. Kuala Lumpur also announced
  an expansionary budget for 1999 to combat rising unemployment.
  Malaysia continues to seek funding from domestic and international
  sources to help finance its budget deficit and recapitalize its
  weakened banking sector.

Economy



Economy--overview: Tourism, Maldives largest industry, accounts
  for about 18% of GDP and more than 60% of the Maldives' foreign
  exchange receipts. Over 90% of government tax revenue comes from
  import duties and tourism-related taxes. About 350,000 tourists
  visited the islands in 1997. Fishing is a second leading growth
  sector. The Maldivian Government began an economic reform program in
  1989 initially by lifting import quotas and opening some exports to
  the private sector. Subsequently, it has liberalized regulations to
  allow more foreign investment. Agriculture and manufacturing
  continue to play a minor role in the economy, constrained by the
  limited availability of cultivable land and the shortage of domestic
  labor. Most staple foods must be imported. Industry, which consists
  mainly of garment production, boat building, and handicrafts,
  accounts for about 15% of GDP. Maldivian authorities worry about the
  impact of erosion and possible global warming on their low-lying
  country; 80% of the area is one meter or less above sea level.

Economy



Economy--overview: Mali is among the poorest countries in the
  world, with 65% of its land area desert or semidesert. Economic
  activity is largely confined to the riverine area irrigated by the
  Niger. About 10% of the population is nomadic and some 80% of the
  labor force is engaged in farming and fishing. Industrial activity
  is concentrated on processing farm commodities. Mali is heavily
  dependent on foreign aid and vulnerable to fluctuations in world
  prices for cotton, its main export. In 1997, the government
  continued its successful implementation of an IMF-recommended
  structural adjustment program that is helping the economy grow,
  diversify, and attract foreign investment. Mali's adherence to
  economic reform, and the 50% devaluation of the African franc in
  January 1994, has pushed up economic growth. Several multinational
  corporations increased gold mining operations in 1996-98, and the
  government anticipates that Mali will become a major Sub-Saharan
  gold exporter in the next few years. Annual growth thus may fall in
  the 5% range in 1999-2000, and inflation held to 5% or less.

Economy



Economy--overview: Significant resources are limestone, a
  favorable geographic location, and a productive labor force. Malta
  produces only about 20% of its food needs, has limited freshwater
  supplies, and has no domestic energy sources. The economy is
  dependent on foreign trade, manufacturing (especially electronics
  and textiles), and tourism; the state-owned Malta drydocks employs
  about 3,800 people. In 1998, almost 1 million tourists visited the
  island. Per capita GDP of roughly $13,000 places Malta in the ranks
  of the less affluent EU countries. The island is divided politically
  over the question of joining the EU. The sizable budget deficit
  remains a key concern.

Economy



Economy--overview: Offshore banking, manufacturing, and tourism
  are key sectors of the economy. The government's policy of offering
  incentives to high-technology companies and financial institutions
  to locate on the island has paid off in expanding employment
  opportunities in high-income industries. As a result, agriculture
  and fishing, once the mainstays of the economy, have declined in
  their shares of GDP. Banking and other services now contribute more
  than four fifths of GDP. Trade is mostly with the UK. The Isle of
  Man enjoys free access to EU markets.

Economy



Economy--overview: US Government assistance is the mainstay of
  this tiny island economy. Agricultural production is concentrated on
  small farms, and the most important commercial crops are coconuts,
  tomatoes, melons, and breadfruit. Small-scale industry is limited to
  handicrafts, fish processing, and copra. The tourist industry, now a
  small source of foreign exchange employing less than 10% of the
  labor force, remains the best hope for future added income. The
  islands have few natural resources, and imports far exceed exports.
  Under the terms of the Compact of Free Association, the US provides
  roughly $65 million in annual aid, equal to about 70% of GDP.
  Negotiations will get underway in 1999 for an extended agreement.
  Government downsizing, drought, a drop in construction, and the
  decline in tourism and foreign investment due to the Asian financial
  difficulties have caused GDP to fall in 1996-98.

Economy



Economy--overview: The economy is based on sugarcane, bananas,
  tourism, and light industry. Agriculture accounts for about 6% of
  GDP and the small industrial sector for 11%. Sugar production has
  declined, with most of the sugarcane now used for the production of
  rum. Banana exports are increasing, going mostly to France. The bulk
  of meat, vegetable, and grain requirements must be imported,
  contributing to a chronic trade deficit that requires large annual
  transfers of aid from France. Tourism has become more important than
  agricultural exports as a source of foreign exchange. The majority
  of the work force is employed in the service sector and in
  administration.

Economy



Economy--overview: A majority of the population still depends on
  agriculture and livestock for a livelihood, even though most of the
  nomads and many subsistence farmers were forced into the cities by
  recurrent droughts in the 1970s and 1980s. Mauritania has extensive
  deposits of iron ore, which account for almost 50% of total exports.
  The decline in world demand for this ore, however, has led to
  cutbacks in production. The nation's coastal waters are among the
  richest fishing areas in the world, but overexploitation by
  foreigners threatens this key source of revenue. The country's first
  deepwater port opened near Nouakchott in 1986. In recent years,
  drought and economic mismanagement have resulted in a substantial
  buildup of foreign debt. The government has begun the second stage
  of an economic reform program in consultation with the World Bank,
  the IMF, and major donor countries. Short-term growth prospects are
  uncertain because of the heavy debt service burden, rapid population
  growth, and vulnerability to climatic conditions.

Economy



Economy--overview: Since independence in 1968, Mauritius has
  developed from a low income, agriculturally based economy to a
  middle income diversified economy with growing industrial, financial
  services, and tourist sectors. For most of the period, annual growth

  been reflected in increased life expectancy, lowered infant
  mortality, and a much improved infrastructure. Sugarcane is grown on
  about 90% of the cultivated land area and accounts for 25% of export

  industrialization (with a view to modernization and to exports),
  agricultural diversification, and tourism. Economic performance in

Economy



Economy--overview: Mexico has a free market economy with a mixture
  of modern and outmoded industry and agriculture, increasingly
  dominated by the private sector. The number of state-owned
  enterprises in Mexico has fallen from more than 1,000 in 1982 to
  fewer than 200 in 1998. The ZEDILLO administration is privatizing
  and expanding competition in sea ports, railroads,
  telecommunications, electricity, natural gas distribution, and
  airports. A strong export sector helped to cushion the economy's
  decline in 1995 and led the recovery in 1996 and 1997. In 1998,
  private consumption became the leading driver of growth, which was
  accompanied by increased employment and higher wages. The government
  expects the economy to slow in 1999 because of low commodity prices,
  tighter international liquidity, and slacker demand for exports.
  Mexico still needs to overcome many structural problems as it
  strives to modernize its economy and raise living standards. Income
  distribution is very unequal, with the top 20% of income earners
  accounting for 55% of income. Trade with the US and Canada has
  nearly doubled since NAFTA was implemented in 1994. Mexico is
  pursuing additional trade agreements with most countries in Latin
  America and with the EU to lessen its dependence on the US.

  with the US pledged to spend $1 billion in the islands in the 1990s.
  Geographical isolation and a poorly developed infrastructure are
  major impediments to long-term growth.

Economy



Economy--overview: Moldova enjoys a favorable climate and good
  farmland but has no major mineral deposits. As a result, the economy
  depends heavily on agriculture, featuring fruits, vegetables, wine,
  and tobacco. Moldova must import all of its supplies of oil, coal,
  and natural gas, largely from Russia. Energy shortages contributed
  to sharp production declines after the breakup of the Soviet Union
  in 1991. The Moldovan Government has recently been making progress
  on an ambitious economic reform agenda. As part of its reform
  efforts, Moldova introduced a stable convertible currency, freed all
  prices, stopped issuing preferential credits to state enterprises
  and backed steady land privatization, removed export controls, and
  freed interest rates. In 1998, the economic troubles of Russia, with
  whom Moldova conducts 55% of its trade, was a major cause of the
  8.6% drop in GDP. In 1999, the IMF resumed payment on Moldova's
  Extended Fund Facility, which had been suspended since 1997. The IMF
  intends to grant $135 million in 1999.

Economy



Economy--overview: Monaco, situated on the French Mediterranean
  coast, is a popular resort, attracting tourists to its casino and
  pleasant climate. The Principality has successfully sought to
  diversify into services and small, high-value-added, nonpolluting
  industries. The state has no income tax and low business taxes and
  thrives as a tax haven both for individuals who have established
  residence and for foreign companies that have set up businesses and
  offices. The state retains monopolies in a number of sectors,
  including tobacco, the telephone network, and the postal service.
  About 55% of Monaco's annual revenue comes from value-added taxes on
  hotels, banks, and the industrial sector. Living standards are high,
  roughly comparable to those in prosperous French metropolitan areas.

Economy



Economy--overview: The government has embraced free-market
  economics, freezing spending, easing price controls, liberalizing
  domestic and international trade. Mongolia's severe climate,
  scattered population, and wide expanses of unproductive land,
  however, have constrained economic development. Economic activity
  traditionally has been based on agriculture and the breeding of
  livestock. In past years, extensive mineral resources had been
  developed with Soviet support; total Soviet assistance at its height
  amounted to 30% of GDP, but disappeared almost overnight in 1990-91.
  The mining and processing of coal, copper, molybdenum, tin,
  tungsten, and gold account for a large part of industrial
  production. The Mongolian leadership has been soliciting support
  from foreign donors and economic growth picked up in 1997 and 1998
  after stalling in 1996 due to a series of natural disasters and
  declines in world prices of copper and cashmere. Mongolia joined the
  World Trade Organization in 1997.

Economy



Economy--overview: Severe volcanic activity, which began in July
  1995, put a damper on this small, open economy throughout 1996-98. A
  catastrophic eruption in June 1997 closed the air and sea ports,
  causing further economic and social dislocation. Two-thirds of the
  12,000 inhabitants fled the island. Some began to return in 1998,
  but lack of housing limited the number. The agriculture sector
  continued to be affected by the lack of suitable land for farming
  and the destruction of crops. Construction was the dominant activity
  in 1997 and 1998. GDP probably declined again in 1998. Prospects for
  the economy depend largely on developments in relation to the
  volcano and on public sector construction activity. The UK has
  committed about $100 million in 1996-98 to help reconstruct the
  economy.

Economy



Economy--overview: Morocco faces the problems typical of
  developing countries--restraining government spending, reducing
  constraints on private activity and foreign trade, and keeping
  inflation within manageable bounds. Since the early 1980s the
  government has pursued an economic program toward these objectives
  with the support of the IMF, the World Bank, and the Paris Club of
  creditors. The dirham is now fully convertible for current account
  transactions; reforms of the financial sector have been implemented;
  and state enterprises are slowly being privatized. Drought
  conditions in 1997 depressed activity in the key agricultural
  sector, holding down exports and contributing to a 2.2% contraction
  in real GDP. Favorable rainfalls in the fall of 1997 have led to
  6.8% real GDP growth in 1998. Growth is forecast to be about 4.0% in
  1999. Formidable long-term challenges include: servicing the
  external debt; preparing the economy for freer trade with the EU;
  and improving education and attracting foreign investment to improve
  living standards and job propects for Morocco's youthful population.

Economy



Economy--overview: Before the peace accord of October 1992,
  Mozambique's economy was devastated by a protracted civil war and
  socialist mismanagement. In 1994, it ranked as one of the poorest
  countries in the world. Since then, Mozambique has undertaken a
  series of economic reforms. Almost all aspects of the economy have
  been liberalized to some extent. More than 900 state enterprises
  have been privatized. Pending are tax and much needed commercial
  code reform, as well as greater private sector involvement in the
  transportation, telecommunications, and energy sectors. Since 1996,
  inflation has been low and foreign exchange rates stable. Albeit
  from a small base, Mozambique achieved one of the highest growth
  rates in the world in 1997-98. Still, the country depends on foreign
  assistance to balance the budget and to pay for a trade imbalance in
  which imports outnumber exports by three to one. The medium-term
  outlook for the country looks bright, as trade and transportation
  links to South Africa and the rest of the region are expected to
  improve and sizable foreign investments materialize. Among these
  investments are metal production (aluminum, steel), natural gas,
  power generation, agriculture (cotton, sugar), fishing, timber, and
  transportation services. Additional exports in these areas should
  bring in needed foreign exchange.

Economy



Economy--overview: The economy is heavily dependent on the
  extraction and processing of minerals for export. Mining accounts
  for 20% of GDP. Namibia is the fourth-largest exporter of nonfuel
  minerals in Africa and the world's fifth-largest producer of
  uranium. Rich alluvial diamond deposits make Namibia a primary
  source for gem-quality diamonds. Namibia also produces large
  quantities of lead, zinc, tin, silver, and tungsten. Half of the
  population depends on agriculture (largely subsistence agriculture)
  for its livelihood. Namibia must import some of its food. Although
  per capita GDP is three times the per capita GDP of Africa's poorer
  countries, the majority of Namibia's people live in pronounced
  poverty because of the great inequality of income distribution and
  the large amounts going to foreigners. The Namibian economy has
  close links to South Africa.

Economy



Economy--overview: Revenues come from exports of phosphates, but
  reserves are expected to be exhausted by the year 2000. Phosphates
  have given Nauruans one of the highest per capita incomes in the
  Third World. Few other resources exist, thus most necessities must
  be imported, including fresh water from Australia. The
  rehabilitation of mined land and the replacement of income from
  phosphates are serious long-term problems. Substantial amounts of
  phosphate income are invested in trust funds to help cushion the
  transition. The government also has been borrowing heavily from the
  trusts to finance fiscal deficits. To cut costs the government has
  called a freezing of wages, a reduction of over-staffed public
  service departments, privatization of numerous government agencies,
  and closure of some overseas consulates.

Economy



Economy--overview: Nepal is among the poorest and least developed
  countries in the world with nearly half of its population living
  below the poverty line. Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy,
  providing a livelihood for over 80% of the population and accounting
  for 41% of GDP. Industrial activity mainly involves the processing
  of agricultural produce including jute, sugarcane, tobacco, and
  grain. Production of textiles and carpets has expanded recently and
  accounted for about 80% of foreign exchange earnings in the past
  three years. Apart from agricultural land and forests, exploitable
  natural resources are mica, hydropower, and tourism. Agricultural
  production is growing by about 5% on average as compared with annual
  population growth of 2.5%. Since May 1991, the government has been
  moving forward with economic reforms particularly those that
  encourage trade and foreign investment, e.g., by eliminating
  business licenses and registration requirements in order to simplify
  investment procedures. The government has also been cutting
  expenditures by reducing subsidies, privatizing state industries,
  and laying off civil servants. More recently, however, political
  instability--five different governments over the past few years--has
  hampered Kathmandu's ability to forge consensus to implement key
  economic reforms. Nepal has considerable scope for accelerating
  economic growth by exploiting its potential in hydropower and
  tourism, areas of recent foreign investment interest. Prospects for
  foreign trade or investment in other sectors will remain poor,
  however, because of the small size of the economy, its technological
  backwardness, its remoteness, its landlocked geographic location,
  and its susceptibility to natural disaster. The international
  community's role of funding more than 60% of Nepal's development
  budget and more than 28% of total budgetary expenditures will likely
  continue as a major ingredient of growth.

Economy



Economy--overview: This prosperous and open economy is based on
  private enterprise with the government's presence felt in many
  aspects of the economy. Industrial activity features food
  processing, petroleum refining, and metalworking. The highly
  mechanized agricultural sector employs only 4% of the labor force,
  but provides large surpluses for export and the domestic
  food-processing industry. As a result, the Netherlands ranks third
  worldwide in value of agricultural exports, behind the US and
  France. Sharp cuts in subsidy and social security spending since the
  1980s helped the Dutch achieve sustained economic growth combined
  with falling unemployment and moderate inflation. The economy
  achieved a strong 3.7% growth in 1998; a dip in the business cycle
  probably will cause the economy to decelerate to slightly over 2%
  growth in 1999. Unemployment in 1999 is expected to be less than 5%
  of the labor force, and inflation probably will decline. The Dutch
  joined the first wave of 11 EU countries launching the euro system
  on 1 January 1999.

Economy



Economy--overview: New Caledonia has more than 20% of the world's
  known nickel resources. In recent years, the economy has suffered
  because of depressed international demand for nickel, the principal
  source of export earnings. Only a negligible amount of the land is
  suitable for cultivation, and food accounts for about 25% of
  imports. In addition to nickel, financial support from France and
  tourism are key to the health of the economy. Performance in 1998
  was hampered by the spillover of financial problems in East Asia and
  by lower expected prices for nickel.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)



======================================================================


What's New

- Country information has been updated as of 8 February 2007.

- In the Government category, the "Capital" entry has been greatly
expanded and now contains up to four subfields, including significant
new information having to do with time. The subfields consist of the
name of the capital itself, its geographic coordinates, the time
difference at the capital from coordinated universal time (UTC), and,
if applicable, information on daylight saving time (DST). Where
appropriate, a special note has been added to highlight those
countries that have multiple time zones.

- The Transnational issues category now has a "Trafficking in persons"
entry. Human trafficking connotes modern-day slavery and this important
new field will include information on the most egregious countries
(Tier 2 Watch List and Tier 3) as listed in the US State Department's
annual report.

- A new Appendix G lists Weights and Measures. The appendix includes
information on mathematical notation and metric interrelationships, as
well as over 400 examples of standard conversion factors.

-Revision of some individual country maps, first introduced in the 2001
edition, is continued in this edition. Several regional maps have also
been updated to reflect boundary changes and place name spelling changes.

Factbook fields with Rank Order pages are easily identified with a
small bar chart icon to the right of the data field title.

Not all Rank Order pages include the same number of entries because
information for a particular field is not available for all countries.
In addition, not all data fields are suitable for displaying as Rank
Order pages, such as those containing textual information. Textual
information is more readily viewed by clicking on the Field Listing
icon next to the Data field title. The other icon next to the data
field title provides the definition of the field.

All of the 'Rank Order' pages can be downloaded as tab-delimited data
files and can be opened in other applications such as spreadsheets and
databases. To save a Rank Order page in a spreadsheet, first click on
the 'Download Datafile' choice above the Rank Order page you selected;
then, at the top of your browser window, click on 'File' and 'Save As'.
After saving the file, open the spreadsheet, find the saved file, and
'Open' it.

Additional Rank Order pages being considered for future updates of the
Factbook Web site include:

Median age
Literacy
Population below the poverty line

Notes and Definitions


Along with regular information updates, The World Factbook features
several new or revised fields. In the Government category, the
"Capital" entry has been greatly expanded and now contains up to four
subfields, including significant new information having to do with
time. The subfields consist of the name of the capital itself, its
geographic coordinates, the time difference at the capital from
coordinated universal time (UTC), and, if applicable, information on
daylight saving time (DST). Where appropriate, a special note has been
added to highlight those countries that have multiple time zones. The
Transnational issues category now has a "Trafficking in persons" entry.
Human trafficking connotes modern-day slavery and this important new
field will include information on the most egregious countries (Tier 2
Watch List and Tier 3) as listed in the US State Department's annual
report.



Abbreviations:  This information is included in Appendix A:
Abbreviations, which includes all abbreviations and acronyms used in
the Factbook, with their expansions.

Acronyms:  An acronym is an abbreviation coined from the initial letter
of each successive word in a term or phrase. In general, an acronym
made up solely from the first letter of the major words in the expanded
form is rendered in all capital letters (NATO from North Atlantic
Treaty Organization; an exception would be ASEAN for Association of
Southeast Asian Nations). In general, an acronym made up of more than
the first letter of the major words in the expanded form is rendered
with only an initial capital letter (Comsat from Communications
Satellite Corporation; an exception would be NAM from Nonaligned
Movement). Hybrid forms are sometimes used to distinguish between
initially identical terms (WTO: for World Trade Organization and WToO
for World Tourism Organization.)

Administrative divisions:  This entry generally gives the numbers,
designatory terms, and first-order administrative divisions as approved
by the US Board on Geographic Names (BGN). Changes that have been
reported but not yet acted on by BGN are noted.

Age structure:  This entry provides the distribution of the population
according to age. Information is included by sex and age group (0-14
years, 15-64 years, 65 years and over). The age structure of a
population affects a nation's key socioeconomic issues. Countries with
young populations (high percentage under age 15) need to invest more in
schools, while countries with older populations (high percentage ages
65 and over) need to invest more in the health sector. The age
structure can also be used to help predict potential political issues.
For example, the rapid growth of a young adult population unable to
find employment can lead to unrest.

Agriculture - products:  This entry is an ordered listing of major
crops and products starting with the most important.

Airports:  This entry gives the total number of airports or airfields
recognizable from the air. The runway(s) may be paved (concrete or
asphalt surfaces) or unpaved (grass, earth, sand, or gravel surfaces)
but may include closed or abandoned installations. Airports or
airfields that are no longer recognizable (overgrown, no facilities,
etc.) are not included. Note that not all airports have accomodations
for refueling, maintenance, or air traffic control.

Airports - with paved runways:  This entry gives the total number of
airports with paved runways (concrete or asphalt surfaces) by length.
For airports with more than one runway, only the longest runway is
included according to the following five groups - (1) over 3,047 m, (2)
2,438 to 3,047 m, (3) 1,524 to 2,437 m, (4) 914 to 1,523 m, and (5)
under 914 m. Only airports with usable runways are included in this
listing. Not all airports have facilities for refueling, maintenance,
or air traffic control.

Airports - with unpaved runways:  This entry gives the total number of
airports with unpaved runways (grass, dirt, sand, or gravel surfaces)
by length. For airports with more than one runway, only the longest
runway is included according to the following five groups - (1) over
3,047 m, (2) 2,438 to 3,047 m, (3) 1,524 to 2,437 m, (4) 914 to 1,523
m, and (5) under 914 m. Only airports with usable runways are included
in this listing. Not all airports have facilities for refueling,
maintenance, or air traffic control.

Appendixes:  This section includes Factbook-related material by topic.

Area:  This entry includes three subfields. Total area is the sum of
all land and water areas delimited by international boundaries and/or
coastlines. Land area is the aggregate of all surfaces delimited by
international boundaries and/or coastlines, excluding inland water
bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers). Water area is the sum of the
surfaces of all inland water bodies, such as lakes, reservoirs, or
rivers, as delimited by international boundaries and/or coastlines.

Area - comparative:  This entry provides an area comparison based on
total area equivalents. Most entities are compared with the entire US
or one of the 50 states based on area measurements (1990 revised)
provided by the US Bureau of the Census. The smaller entities are
compared with Washington, DC (178 sq km, 69 sq mi) or The Mall in
Washington, DC (0.59 sq km, 0.23 sq mi, 146 acres).

Background:  This entry usually highlights major historic events and
current issues and may include a statement about one or two key future
trends.

Birth rate:  This entry gives the average annual number of births
during a year per 1,000 persons in the population at midyear; also
known as crude birth rate. The birth rate is usually the dominant
factor in determining the rate of population growth. It depends on both
the level of fertility and the age structure of the population.

Budget:  This entry includes revenues, expenditures, and capital
expenditures. These figures are calculated on an exchange rate basis,
i.e., not in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.

Capital:  This entry gives the name of the seat of government, its
geographic coordinates, the time difference relative to Coordinated
Universal Time (UTC) and the time observed in Washington, DC, and, if
applicable, information on daylight saving time (DST). Where
appropriate, a special note has been added to highlight those countries
that have multiple time zones.

Climate:  This entry includes a brief description of typical weather
regimes throughout the year.

Coastline:  This entry gives the total length of the boundary between
the land area (including islands) and the sea.

Communications:  This category deals with the means of exchanging
information and includes the telephone, radio, television, and Internet
host entries.

Communications - note:  This entry includes miscellaneous
communications information of significance not included elsewhere.

Constitution:  This entry includes the dates of adoption, revisions,
and major amendments.

Coordinated Universal Time (UTC):  UTC is the international atomic time
scale that serves as the basis of timekeeping for most of the world.
The hours, minutes, and seconds expressed by UTC represent the time of
day at the Prime Meridian (0 deg. longitude) located near Greenwich,
England as reckoned from midnight. UTC is calculated by the Bureau
International des Poids et Measures (BIPM) in Sevres, France. The BIPM
averages data collected from more than 200 atomic time and frequency
standards located at about 50 laboratories worldwide. UTC is the basis
for all civil time with the Earth divided into time zones expressed as
positive or negative differences from UTC. UTC is also referred to as
"Zulu time." See the Standard Time Zones of the World map included with
the Reference Maps.

Country data codes:  see Data codes

Country map:  Most versions of the Factbook provide a country map in
color. The maps were produced from the best information available at
the time of preparation. Names and/or boundaries may have changed
subsequently.

Country name:  This entry includes all forms of the country's name
approved by the US Board on Geographic Names (Italy is used as an
example): conventional long form (Italian Republic), conventional short
form (Italy), local long form (Repubblica Italiana), local short form
(Italia), former (Kingdom of Italy), as well as the abbreviation. Also
see the Terminology note.

Crude oil:  See entry for oil.

Currency (code):  This entry identifies the national medium of exchange
and, in parenthesis, gives the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO) 4217 alphabetic currency code for each country.

Current account balance:  This entry records a country's net trade in
goods and services, plus net earnings from rents, interest, profits,
and dividends, and net transfer payments (such as pension funds and
worker remittances) to and from the rest of the world during the period
specified. These figures are calculated on an exchange rate basis,
i.e., not in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.

Data codes:  This information is presented in Appendix D: Cross-
Reference List of Country Data Codes and Appendix E: Cross-Reference
List of Hydrographic Data Codes.

Date of information:  In general, information available as of 1 January
2007, was used in the preparation of this edition.

Daylight Saving Time (DST):  This entry is included for those entities
that have adopted a policy of adjusting the official local time
forward, usually one hour, from Standard Time during summer months.
Such policies are most common in mid-latitude regions.

Death rate:  This entry gives the average annual number of deaths
during a year per 1,000 population at midyear; also known as crude
death rate. The death rate, while only a rough indicator of the
mortality situation in a country, accurately indicates the current
mortality impact on population growth. This indicator is significantly
affected by age distribution, and most countries will eventually show a
rise in the overall death rate, in spite of continued decline in
mortality at all ages, as declining fertility results in an aging
population.

Debt - external:  This entry gives the total public and private debt
owed to nonresidents repayable in foreign currency, goods, or services.
These figures are calculated on an exchange rate basis, i.e., not in
purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.

Dependency status:  This entry describes the formal relationship
between a particular nonindependent entity and an independent state.

Dependent areas:  This entry contains an alphabetical listing of all
nonindependent entities associated in some way with a particular
independent state.

Diplomatic representation:  The US Government has diplomatic relations
with 188 independent states, including 187 of the 192 UN members
(excluded UN members are Bhutan, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and the US
itself). In addition, the US has diplomatic relations with 1
independent state that is not in the UN, the Holy See, as well as with
the EU.

Diplomatic representation from the US:  This entry includes the chief
of mission, embassy address, mailing address, telephone number, FAX
number, branch office locations, consulate general locations, and
consulate locations.

Diplomatic representation in the US:  This entry includes the chief of
mission, chancery, telephone, FAX, consulate general locations, and
consulate locations.

Disputes - international:  This entry includes a wide variety of
situations that range from traditional bilateral boundary disputes to
unilateral claims of one sort or another. Information regarding
disputes over international terrestrial and maritime boundaries has
been reviewed by the US Department of State. References to other
situations involving borders or frontiers may also be included, such as
resource disputes, geopolitical questions, or irredentist issues;
however, inclusion does not necessarily constitute official acceptance
or recognition by the US Government.

Distribution of family income - Gini index:  This index measures the
degree of inequality in the distribution of family income in a country.
The index is calculated from the Lorenz curve, in which cumulative
family income is plotted against the number of families arranged from
the poorest to the richest. The index is the ratio of (a) the area
between a country's Lorenz curve and the 45 degree helping line to (b)
the entire triangular area under the 45 degree line. The more nearly
equal a country's income distribution, the closer its Lorenz curve to
the 45 degree line and the lower its Gini index, e.g., a Scandinavian
country with an index of 25. The more unequal a country's income
distribution, the farther its Lorenz curve from the 45 degree line and
the higher its Gini index, e.g., a Sub-Saharan country with an index of
50. If income were distributed with perfect equality, the Lorenz curve
would coincide with the 45 degree line and the index would be zero; if
income were distributed with perfect inequality, the Lorenz curve would
coincide with the horizontal axis and the right vertical axis and the
index would be 100.

Economic aid - donor:  This entry refers to net official development
assistance (ODA) from Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) nations to developing countries and multilateral
organizations. ODA is defined as financial assistance that is
concessional in character, has the main objective to promote economic
development and welfare of the less developed countries (LDCs), and
contains a grant element of at least 25%. The entry does not cover
other official flows (OOF) or private flows. These figures are
calculated on an exchange rate basis, i.e., not in purchasing power
parity (PPP) terms.

Economic aid - recipient:  This entry, which is subject to major
problems of definition and statistical coverage, refers to the net
inflow of Official Development Finance (ODF) to recipient countries.
The figure includes assistance from the World Bank, the IMF, and other
international organizations and from individual nation donors. Formal
commitments of aid are included in the data. Omitted from the data are
grants by private organizations. Aid comes in various forms including
outright grants and loans. The entry thus is the difference between new
inflows and repayments. These figures are calculated on an exchange
rate basis, i.e., not in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.

Economy:  This category includes the entries dealing with the size,
development, and management of productive resources, i.e., land, labor,
and capital.

Economy - overview:  This entry briefly describes the type of economy,
including the degree of market orientation, the level of economic
development, the most important natural resources, and the unique areas
of specialization. It also characterizes major economic events and
policy changes in the most recent 12 months and may include a statement
about one or two key future macroeconomic trends.

Electricity - consumption:  This entry consists of total electricity
generated annually plus imports and minus exports, expressed in
kilowatt-hours. The discrepancy between the amount of electricity
generated and/or imported and the amount consumed and/or exported is
accounted for as loss in transmission and distribution.

Electricity - exports:  This entry is the total exported electricity in
kilowatt-hours.

Electricity - imports:  This entry is the total imported electricity in
kilowatt-hours.

Electricity - production:  This entry is the annual electricity
generated expressed in kilowatt-hours. The discrepancy between the
amount of electricity generated and/or imported and the amount consumed
and/or exported is accounted for as loss in transmission and
distribution.

Elevation extremes:  This entry includes both the highest point and the
lowest point.

Entities:  Some of the independent states, dependencies, areas of
special sovereignty, and governments included in this publication are
not independent, and others are not officially recognized by the US
Government. "Independent state" refers to a people politically
organized into a sovereign state with a definite territory.
"Dependencies" and "areas of special sovereignty" refer to a broad
category of political entities that are associated in some way with an
independent state. "Country" names used in the table of contents or for
page headings are usually the short-form names as approved by the US
Board on Geographic Names and may include independent states,
dependencies, and areas of special sovereignty, or other geographic
entities. There are a total of 268 separate geographic entities in The
World Factbook that may be categorized as follows:

Environment - current issues:  This entry lists the most pressing and
important environmental problems. The following terms and abbreviations
are used throughout the entry:

Acidification - the lowering of soil and water pH due to acid
precipitation and deposition usually through precipitation; this
process disrupts ecosystem nutrient flows and may kill freshwater fish
and plants dependent on more neutral or alkaline conditions (see acid
rain).

Acid rain - characterized as containing harmful levels of sulfur
dioxide or nitrogen oxide; acid rain is damaging and potentially deadly
to the earth's fragile ecosystems; acidity is measured using the pH
scale where 7 is neutral, values greater than 7 are considered
alkaline, and values below 5.6 are considered acid precipitation; note
- a pH of 2.4 (the acidity of vinegar) has been measured in rainfall in
New England.

Aerosol - a collection of airborne particles dispersed in a gas, smoke,
or fog.

Afforestation - converting a bare or agricultural space by planting
trees and plants; reforestation involves replanting trees on areas that
have been cut or destroyed by fire.

Asbestos - a naturally occurring soft fibrous mineral commonly used in
fireproofing materials and considered to be highly carcinogenic in
particulate form.

Biodiversity - also biological diversity; the relative number of
species, diverse in form and function, at the genetic, organism,
community, and ecosystem level; loss of biodiversity reduces an
ecosystem's ability to recover from natural or man-induced disruption.

Bio-indicators - a plant or animal species whose presence, abundance,
and health reveal the general condition of its habitat.
Biomass - the total weight or volume of living matter in a given area
or volume.

Carbon cycle - the term used to describe the exchange of carbon (in
various forms, e.g., as carbon dioxide) between the atmosphere, ocean,
terrestrial biosphere, and geological deposits.

Catchments - assemblages used to capture and retain rainwater and
runoff; an important water management technique in areas with limited
freshwater resources, such as Gibraltar.

DDT (dichloro-diphenyl-trichloro-ethane) - a colorless, odorless
insecticide that has toxic effects on most animals; the use of DDT was
banned in the US in 1972.

Defoliants - chemicals which cause plants to lose their leaves
artificially; often used in agricultural practices for weed control,
and may have detrimental impacts on human and ecosystem health.

Deforestation - the destruction of vast areas of forest (e.g.,
unsustainable forestry practices, agricultural and range land clearing,
and the over exploitation of wood products for use as fuel) without
planting new growth.

Desertification - the spread of desert-like conditions in arid or semi-
arid areas, due to overgrazing, loss of agriculturally productive
soils, or climate change.

Dredging - the practice of deepening an existing waterway; also, a
technique used for collecting bottom-dwelling marine organisms (e.g.,
shellfish) or harvesting coral, often causing significant destruction
of reef and ocean-floor ecosystems.

Drift-net fishing - done with a net, miles in extent, that is generally
anchored to a boat and left to float with the tide; often results in an
over harvesting and waste of large populations of non-commercial marine
species (by-catch) by its effect of "sweeping the ocean clean".

Ecosystems - ecological units comprised of complex communities of
organisms and their specific environments.

Effluents - waste materials, such as smoke, sewage, or industrial waste
which are released into the environment, subsequently polluting it.

Endangered species - a species that is threatened with extinction
either by direct hunting or habitat destruction.

Freshwater - water with very low soluble mineral content; sources
include lakes, streams, rivers, glaciers, and underground aquifers.

Greenhouse gas - a gas that "traps" infrared radiation in the lower
atmosphere causing surface warming; water vapor, carbon dioxide,
nitrous oxide, methane, hydrofluorocarbons, and ozone are the primary
greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere.

Groundwater - water sources found below the surface of the earth often
in naturally occurring reservoirs in permeable rock strata; the source
for wells and natural springs.

Highlands Water Project - a series of dams constructed jointly by
Lesotho and South Africa to redirect Lesotho's abundant water supply
into a rapidly growing area in South Africa; while it is the largest
infrastructure project in southern Africa, it is also the most costly
and controversial; objections to the project include claims that it
forces people from their homes, submerges farmlands, and squanders
economic resources.

Inuit Circumpolar Conference (ICC) - represents the 145,000 Inuits of
Russia, Alaska, Canada, and Greenland in international environmental
issues; a General Assembly convenes every three years to determine the
focus of the ICC; the most current concerns are long-range transport of
pollutants, sustainable development, and climate change.

Metallurgical plants - industries which specialize in the science,
technology, and processing of metals; these plants produce highly
concentrated and toxic wastes which can contribute to pollution of
ground water and air when not properly disposed.

Noxious substances - injurious, very harmful to living beings.
Overgrazing - the grazing of animals on plant material faster than it
can naturally regrow leading to the permanent loss of plant cover, a
common effect of too many animals grazing limited range land.

Ozone shield - a layer of the atmosphere composed of ozone gas (O3)
that resides approximately 25 miles above the Earth's surface and
absorbs solar ultraviolet radiation that can be harmful to living
organisms.

Poaching - the illegal killing of animals or fish, a great concern with
respect to endangered or threatened species.

Pollution - the contamination of a healthy environment by man-made
waste.

Potable water - water that is drinkable, safe to be consumed.

Salination - the process through which fresh (drinkable) water becomes
salt (undrinkable) water; hence, desalination is the reverse process;
also involves the accumulation of salts in topsoil caused by
evaporation of excessive irrigation water, a process that can
eventually render soil incapable of supporting crops.

Siltation - occurs when water channels and reservoirs become clotted
with silt and mud, a side effect of deforestation and soil erosion.

Slash-and-burn agriculture - a rotating cultivation technique in which
trees are cut down and burned in order to clear land for temporary
agriculture; the land is used until its productivity declines at which
point a new plot is selected and the process repeats; this practice is
sustainable while population levels are low and time is permitted for
regrowth of natural vegetation; conversely, where these conditions do
not exist, the practice can have disastrous consequences for the
environment.

Soil degradation - damage to the land's productive capacity because of
poor agricultural practices such as the excessive use of pesticides or
fertilizers, soil compaction from heavy equipment, or erosion of
topsoil, eventually resulting in reduced ability to produce
agricultural products.

Soil erosion - the removal of soil by the action of water or wind,
compounded by poor agricultural practices, deforestation, overgrazing,
and desertification.

Ultraviolet (UV) radiation - a portion of the electromagnetic energy
emitted by the sun and naturally filtered in the upper atmosphere by
the ozone layer; UV radiation can be harmful to living organisms and
has been linked to increasing rates of skin cancer in humans.
Water-born diseases - those in which bacteria survive in, and are
transmitted through, water; always a serious threat in areas with an
untreated water supply.


Environment - international agreements:  This entry separates country
participation in international environmental agreements into two levels
- party to and signed, but not ratified. Agreements are listed in
alphabetical order by the abbreviated form of the full name.

Environmental agreements:  This information is presented in Appendix C:
Selected International Environmental Agreements, which includes the
name, abbreviation, date opened for signature, date entered into force,
objective, and parties by category.

Ethnic groups:  This entry provides an ordered listing of ethnic groups
starting with the largest and normally includes the percent of total
population.

Exchange rates:  This entry provides the official value of a country's
monetary unit at a given date or over a given period of time, as
expressed in units of local currency per US dollar and as determined by
international market forces or official fiat.

Executive branch:  This entry includes several subfields. Chief of
state includes the name and title of the titular leader of the country
who represents the state at official and ceremonial functions but may
not be involved with the day-to-day activities of the government. Head
of government includes the name and title of the top administrative
leader who is designated to manage the day-to-day activities of the
government. For example, in the UK, the monarch is the chief of state,
and the prime minister is the head of government. In the US, the
president is both the chief of state and the head of government.
Cabinet includes the official name for this body of high-ranking
advisers and the method for selection of members. Elections includes
the nature of election process or accession to power, date of the last
election, and date of the next election. Election results includes the
percent of vote for each candidate in the last election.

Exports:  This entry provides the total US dollar amount of merchandise
exports on an f.o.b. (free on board) basis. These figures are
calculated on an exchange rate basis, i.e., not in purchasing power
parity (PPP) terms.

Exports - commodities:  This entry provides a rank ordering of exported
products starting with the most important; it sometimes includes the
percent of total dollar value.

Exports - partners:  This entry provides a rank ordering of trading
partners starting with the most important; it sometimes includes the
percent of total dollar value.

Fiscal year:  This entry identifies the beginning and ending months for
a country's accounting period of 12 months, which often is the calendar
year but which may begin in any month. All yearly references are for
the calendar year (CY) unless indicated as a noncalendar fiscal year
(FY).

Flag description:  This entry provides a written flag description
produced from actual flags or the best information available at the
time the entry was written. The flags of independent states are used by
their dependencies unless there is an officially recognized local flag.
Some disputed and other areas do not have flags.

Flag graphic:  Most versions of the Factbook include a color flag at
the beginning of the country profile. The flag graphics were produced
from actual flags or the best information available at the time of
preparation. The flags of independent states are used by their
dependencies unless there is an officially recognized local flag. Some
disputed and other areas do not have flags.

GDP (official exchange rate):  This entry gives the gross domestic
product (GDP) or value of all final goods and services produced within
a nation in a given year. A nation's GDP at offical exchange rates
(OER) is the home-currency-denominated annual GDP figure divided by the
bilateral average US exchange rate with that country in that year. The
measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value
of output. Many economists prefer this measure when gauging the
economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors, judging
that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in
the international marketplace. Official exchange rates, however, can be
artifically fixed and/or subject to manipulation - resulting in claims
of the country having an under- or over-valued currency - and are not
necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate.
Moreover, even if the official exchange rate is market-determined,
market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small
set of goods and services (the ones the country trades) and may not
capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces.
Furthermore, OER-converted GDP is not well suited to comparing domestic
GDP over time, since appreciation/depreciation from one year to the
next will make the OER GDP value rise/fall regardless of whether home-
currency-denominated GDP changed.

GDP (purchasing power parity):  This entry gives the gross domestic
product (GDP) or value of all final goods and services produced within
a nation in a given year. A nation's GDP at purchasing power parity
(PPP) exchange rates is the sum value of all goods and services
produced in the country valued at prices prevailing in the United
States. This is the measure most economists prefer when looking at per-
capita welfare and when comparing living conditions or use of resources
across countries. The measure is difficult to compute, as a US dollar
value has to be assigned to all goods and services in the country
regardless of whether these goods and services have a direct equivalent
in the United States (for example, the value of an ox-cart or non-US
military equipment); as a result, PPP estimates for some countries are
based on a small and sometimes different set of goods and services. In
addition, many countries do not formally participate in the World
Bank's PPP project that calculates these measures, so the resulting GDP
estimates for these countries may lack precision. For many developing
countries, PPP-based GDP measures are multiples of the official
exchange rate (OER) measure. The difference between the OER- and PPP-
denominated GDP values for most of the weathly industrialized countries
are generally much smaller.

GDP - composition by sector:  This entry gives the percentage
contribution of agriculture, industry, and services to total GDP. The
distribution will total less than 100 percent if the data are
incomplete.

GDP - per capita (PPP):  This entry shows GDP on a purchasing power
parity basis divided by population as of 1 July for the same year.

GDP - real growth rate:  This entry gives GDP growth on an annual basis
adjusted for inflation and expressed as a percent.

GDP methodology:  In the Economy category, GDP dollar estimates for
countries are reported both on an official exchange rate (OER) and a
purchasing power parity (PPP) basis. Both measures contain information
that is useful to the reader. The PPP method involves the use of
standardized international dollar price weights, which are applied to
the quantities of final goods and services produced in a given economy.
The data derived from the PPP method probably provides the best
available starting point for comparisons of economic strength and well-
being between countries. In contrast, the currency exchange rate method
involves a variety of international and domestic financial forces that
may not capture the value of domestic output. Furthermore, exchange
rates may suddenly go up or down by 10% or more because of market
forces or official fiat whereas real output has remained unchanged. On
12 January 1994, for example, the 14 countries of the African Financial
Community (whose currencies are tied to the French franc) devalued
their currencies by 50%. This move, of course, did not cut the real
output of these countries by half. Whereas PPP estimates for OECD
countries are quite reliable, PPP estimates for developing countries
are often rough approximations. In developing countries with weak
currencies, the exchange rate estimate of GDP in dollars is typically
one-fourth to one-half the PPP estimate. Most of the GDP estimates for
developing countries are based on extrapolation of PPP numbers
published by the UN International Comparison Program (UNICP) and by
Professors Robert Summers and Alan Heston of the University of
Pennsylvania and their colleagues. GDP derived using the OER method
should be used for the purpose of calculating the share of items such
as exports, imports, military expenditures, external debt, or the
current account balance, because the dollar values presented in the
Factbook for these items have been converted at official exchange
rates, not at PPP. One should use the OER GDP figure to calculate the
proportion of, say, Chinese defense expenditures in GDP, because that
share will be the same as one calculated in local currency units.
Comparison of OER GDP with PPP GDP may also indicate whether a currency
is over- or under-valued. If OER GDP is smaller than PPP GDP, the
official exchange rate may be undervalued, and vice versa. However,
there is no strong historical evidence that market exchange rates move
in the direction implied by the PPP rate, at least not in the short- or
medium-term. Note: the numbers for GDP and other economic data should
not be chained together from successive volumes of the Factbook because
of changes in the US dollar measuring rod, revisions of data by
statistical agencies, use of new or different sources of information,
and changes in national statistical methods and practices.

GNP:  Gross national product (GNP) is the value of all final goods and
services produced within a nation in a given year, plus income earned
by its citizens abroad, minus income earned by foreigners from domestic
production. The Factbook, following current practice, uses GDP rather
than GNP to measure national production. However, the user must realize
that in certain countries net remittances from citizens working abroad
may be important to national well-being.

GWP:  This entry gives the gross world product (GWP) or aggregate value
of all final goods and services produced worldwide in a given year.

Geographic coordinates:  This entry includes rounded latitude and
longitude figures for the purpose of finding the approximate geographic
center of an entity and is based on the Gazetteer of Conventional
Names, Third Edition, August 1988, US Board on Geographic Names and on
other sources.

Geographic names:  This information is presented in Appendix F: Cross-
Reference List of Geographic Names. It includes a listing of various
alternate names, former names, local names, and regional names
referenced to one or more related Factbook entries. Spellings are
normally, but not always, those approved by the US Board on Geographic
Names (BGN). Alternate names and additional information are included in
parentheses.

Geography:  This category includes the entries dealing with the natural
environment and the effects of human activity.

Geography - note:  This entry includes miscellaneous geographic
information of significance not included elsewhere.

Gini index:  See entry for Distribution of family income - Gini index

Government:  This category includes the entries dealing with the system
for the adoption and administration of public policy.

Government - note:  This entry includes miscellaneous government
information of significance not included elsewhere.


Government type:  This entry gives the basic form of government.
Definitions of the major governmental terms are as follows:

Anarchy - a condition of lawlessness or political disorder brought
about by the absence of governmental authority.

Commonwealth - a nation, state, or other political entity founded on
law and united by a compact of the people for the common good.

Communism - a system of government in which the state plans and
controls the economy and a single - often authoritarian - party holds
power; state controls are imposed with the elimination of private
ownership of property or capital while claiming to make progress toward
a higher social order in which all goods are equally shared by the
people (i.e., a classless society).

Confederacy (Confederation) - a union by compact or treaty between
states, provinces, or territories, that creates a central government
with limited powers; the constituent entities retain supreme authority
over all matters except those delegated to the central government.

Constitutional - a government by or operating under an authoritative
document (constitution) that sets forth the system of fundamental laws
and principles that determines the nature, functions, and limits of
that government.

Constitutional democracy - a form of government in which the sovereign
power of the people is spelled out in a governing constitution.

Constitutional monarchy - a system of government in which a monarch is
guided by a constitution whereby his/her rights, duties, and
responsibilities are spelled out in written law or by custom.

Democracy - a form of government in which the supreme power is retained
by the people, but which is usually exercised indirectly through a
system of representation and delegated authority periodically renewed.

Democratic republic - a state in which the supreme power rests in the
body of citizens entitled to vote for officers and representatives
responsible to them.

Dictatorship - a form of government in which a ruler or small clique
wield absolute power (not restricted by a constitution or laws).

Ecclesiastical - a government administrated by a church.

Emirate - similar to a monarchy or sultanate, but a government in which
the supreme power is in the hands of an emir (the ruler of a Muslim
state); the emir may be an absolute overlord or a sovereign with
constitutionally limited authority.

Federal (Federative) - a form of government in which sovereign power is
formally divided - usually by means of a constitution - between a
central authority and a number of constituent regions (states,
colonies, or provinces) so that each region retains some management of
its internal affairs; differs from a confederacy in that the central
government exerts influence directly upon both individuals as well as
upon the regional units.

Federal republic - a state in which the powers of the central
government are restricted and in which the component parts (states,
colonies, or provinces) retain a degree of self-government; ultimate
sovereign power rests with the voters who chose their governmental
representatives.

Islamic republic - a particular form of government adoped by some
Muslim states; although such a state is, in theory, a theocracy, it
remains a republic, but its laws are required to be compatible with the
laws of Islam.

Maoism - the theory and practice of Marxism-Leninism developed in China
by Mao Zedong (Mao Tse-tung), which states that a continuous revolution
is necessary if the leaders of a communist state are to keep in touch
with the people.

Marxism - the political, economic, and social principles espoused by
19th century economist Karl Marx; he viewed the struggle of workers as
a progression of historical forces that would proceed from a class
struggle of the proletariat (workers) exploited by capitalists
(business owners), to a socialist "dictatorship of the proletariat,"
to, finally, a classless society - Communism.

Marxism-Leninism - an expanded form of communism developed by Lenin
from doctrines of Karl Marx; Lenin saw imperialism as the final stage
of capitalism and shifted the focus of workers' struggle from developed
to underdeveloped countries.

Monarchy - a government in which the supreme power is lodged in the
hands of a monarch who reigns over a state or territory, usually for
life and by hereditary right; the monarch may be either a sole absolute
ruler or a sovereign - such as a king, queen, or prince - with
constitutionally limited authority.

Oligarchy - a government in which control is exercised by a small group
of individuals whose authority generally is based on wealth or power.
Parliamentary democracy - a political system in which the legislature
(parliament) selects the government - a prime minister, premier, or
chancellor along with the cabinet ministers - according to party
strength as expressed in elections; by this system, the government
acquires a dual responsibility: to the people as well as to the
parliament.

Parliamentary government (Cabinet-Parliamentary government) - a
government in which members of an executive branch (the cabinet and its
leader - a prime minister, premier, or chancellor) are nominated to
their positions by a legislature or parliament, and are directly
responsible to it; this type of government can be dissolved at will by
the parliament (legislature) by means of a no confidence vote or the
leader of the cabinet may dissolve the parliament if it can no longer
function.

Parliamentary monarchy - a state headed by a monarch who is not
actively involved in policy formation or implementation (i.e., the
exercise of sovereign powers by a monarch in a ceremonial capacity);
true governmental leadership is carried out by a cabinet and its head -
a prime minister, premier, or chancellor - who are drawn from a
legislature (parliament).

Republic - a representative democracy in which the people's elected
deputies (representatives), not the people themselves, vote on
legislation.

Socialism - a government in which the means of planning, producing, and
distributing goods is controlled by a central government that
theoretically seeks a more just and equitable distribution of property
and labor; in actuality, most socialist governments have ended up being
no more than dictatorships over workers by a ruling elite.

Sultanate - similar to a monarchy, but a government in which the
supreme power is in the hands of a sultan (the head of a Muslim state);
the sultan may be an absolute ruler or a sovereign with
constitutionally limited authority.

Theocracy - a form of government in which a Deity is recognized as the
supreme civil ruler, but the Deity's laws are interpreted by
ecclesiastical authorities (bishops, mullahs, etc.); a government
subject to religious authority.

Totalitarian - a government that seeks to subordinate the individual to
the state by controlling not only all political and economic matters,
but also the attitudes, values, and beliefs of its population.


Greenwich Mean Time (GMT):  The mean solar time at the Greenwich
Meridian, Greenwich, England, with the hours and days, since 1925,
reckoned from midnight. GMT is now a historical term having been
replaced by UTC on 1 January 1972. See Coordinated Universal Time.

HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate:  This entry gives an estimate of the
percentage of adults (aged 15-49) living with HIV/AIDS. The adult
prevalence rate is calculated by dividing the estimated number of
adults living with HIV/AIDS at yearend by the total adult population at
yearend.

HIV/AIDS - deaths:  This entry gives an estimate of the number of
adults and children who died of AIDS during a given calendar year.

HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS:  This entry gives an estimate
of all people (adults and children) alive at yearend with HIV
infection, whether or not they have developed symptoms of AIDS.

Heliports:  This entry gives the total number of heliports with hard-
surface runways, helipads, or landing areas that support routine
sustained helicopter operations exclusively and have support facilities
including one or more of the following facilities: lighting, fuel,
passenger handling, or maintenance. It includes former airports used
exclusively for helicopter operations but excludes heliports limited to
day operations and natural clearings that could support helicopter
landings and takeoffs.

Household income or consumption by percentage share:  Data on household
income or consumption come from household surveys, the results adjusted
for household size. Nations use different standards and procedures in
collecting and adjusting the data. Surveys based on income will
normally show a more unequal distribution than surveys based on
consumption. The quality of surveys is improving with time, yet caution
is still necessary in making inter-country comparisons.

Hydrographic data codes:  see Data codes

Illicit drugs:  This entry gives information on the five categories of
illicit drugs - narcotics, stimulants, depressants (sedatives),
hallucinogens, and cannabis. These categories include many drugs
legally produced and prescribed by doctors as well as those illegally
produced and sold outside of medical channels.

Cannabis (Cannabis sativa) is the common hemp plant, which provides
hallucinogens with some sedative properties, and includes marijuana
(pot, Acapulco gold, grass, reefer), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC,
Marinol), hashish (hash), and hashish oil (hash oil).

Coca (mostly Erythroxylum coca) is a bush with leaves that contain the
stimulant used to make cocaine. Coca is not to be confused with cocoa,
which comes from cacao seeds and is used in making chocolate, cocoa,
and cocoa butter.

Cocaine is a stimulant derived from the leaves of the coca bush.
Depressants (sedatives) are drugs that reduce tension and anxiety and
include chloral hydrate, barbiturates (Amytal, Nembutal, Seconal,
phenobarbital), benzodiazepines (Librium, Valium), methaqualone
(Quaalude), glutethimide (Doriden), and others (Equanil, Placidyl,
Valmid).

Drugs are any chemical substances that effect a physical, mental,
emotional, or behavioral change in an individual.

Drug abuse is the use of any licit or illicit chemical substance that
results in physical, mental, emotional, or behavioral impairment in an
individual.

Hallucinogens are drugs that affect sensation, thinking, self-
awareness, and emotion. Hallucinogens include LSD (acid, microdot),
mescaline and peyote (mexc, buttons, cactus), amphetamine variants
(PMA, STP, DOB), phencyclidine (PCP, angel dust, hog), phencyclidine
analogues (PCE, PCPy, TCP), and others (psilocybin, psilocyn).
Hashish is the resinous exudate of the cannabis or hemp plant (Cannabis
sativa).

Heroin is a semisynthetic derivative of morphine.

Mandrax is a trade name for methaqualone, a pharmaceutical depressant.
Marijuana is the dried leaf of the cannabis or hemp plant (Cannabis
sativa).

Methaqualone is a pharmaceutical depressant, referred to as mandrax in
Southwest Asia and Africa.

Narcotics are drugs that relieve pain, often induce sleep, and refer to
opium, opium derivatives, and synthetic substitutes. Natural narcotics
include opium (paregoric, parepectolin), morphine (MS-Contin, Roxanol),
codeine (Tylenol with codeine, Empirin with codeine, Robitussan AC),
and thebaine. Semisynthetic narcotics include heroin (horse, smack),
and hydromorphone (Dilaudid). Synthetic narcotics include meperidine or
Pethidine (Demerol, Mepergan), methadone (Dolophine, Methadose), and
others (Darvon, Lomotil).

Opium is the brown, gummy exudate of the incised, unripe seedpod of the
opium poppy.

Opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) is the source for the natural and
semisynthetic narcotics.

Poppy straw is the entire cut and dried opium poppy-plant material,
other than the seeds. Opium is extracted from poppy straw in commercial
operations that produce the drug for medical use.

Qat (kat, khat) is a stimulant from the buds or leaves of Catha edulis
that is chewed or drunk as tea.

Quaaludes is the North American slang term for methaqualone, a
pharmaceutical depressant.

Stimulants are drugs that relieve mild depression, increase energy and
activity, and include cocaine (coke, snow, crack), amphetamines
(Desoxyn, Dexedrine), ephedrine, ecstasy (clarity, essence, doctor,
Adam), phenmetrazine (Preludin), methylphenidate (Ritalin), and others
(Cylert, Sanorex, Tenuate).


Imports:  This entry provides the total US dollar amount of merchandise
imports on a c.i.f. (cost, insurance, and freight) or f.o.b. (free on
board) basis. These figures are calculated on an exchange rate basis,
i.e., not in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.

Imports - commodities:  This entry provides a rank ordering of imported
products starting with the most important; it sometimes includes the
percent of total dollar value.

Imports - partners:  This entry provides a rank ordering of trading
partners starting with the most important; it sometimes includes the
percent of total dollar value.

Independence:  For most countries, this entry gives the date that
sovereignty was achieved and from which nation, empire, or trusteeship.
For the other countries, the date given may not represent
"independence" in the strict sense, but rather some significant
nationhood event such as the traditional founding date or the date of
unification, federation, confederation, establishment, fundamental
change in the form of government, or state succession. Dependent areas
include the notation "none" followed by the nature of their dependency
status. Also see the Terminology note.

Industrial production growth rate:  This entry gives the annual
percentage increase in industrial production (includes manufacturing,
mining, and construction).

Industries:  This entry provides a rank ordering of industries starting
with the largest by value of annual output.

Infant mortality rate:  This entry gives the number of deaths of
infants under one year old in a given year per 1,000 live births in the
same year; included is the total death rate, and deaths by sex, male
and female. This rate is often used as an indicator of the level of
health in a country.

Inflation rate (consumer prices):  This entry furnishes the annual
percent change in consumer prices compared with the previous year's
consumer prices.

International disputes:  see Disputes - international

International organization participation:  This entry lists in
alphabetical order by abbreviation those international organizations in
which the subject country is a member or participates in some other
way.

International organizations:  This information is presented in Appendix
B: International Organizations and Groups which includes the name,
abbreviation, date established, aim, and members by category.

Internet country code:  This entry includes the two-letter codes
maintained by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
in the ISO 3166 Alpha-2 list and used by the Internet Assigned Numbers
Authority (IANA) to establish country-coded top-level domains (ccTLDs).

Internet hosts:  This entry lists the number of Internet hosts
available within a country. An Internet host is a computer connected
directly to the Internet; normally an Internet Service Provider's (ISP)
computer is a host. Internet users may use either a hard-wired
terminal, at an institution with a mainframe computer connected
directly to the Internet, or may connect remotely by way of a modem via
telephone line, cable, or satellite to the Internet Service Provider's
host computer. The number of hosts is one indicator of the extent of
Internet connectivity.

Internet users:  This entry gives the number of users within a country
that access the Internet. Statistics vary from country to country and
may include users who access the Internet at least several times a week
to those who access it only once within a period of several months.

Introduction:  This category includes one entry, Background.

Investment (gross fixed):  This entry records total business spending
on fixed assets, such as factories, machinery, equipment, dwellings,
and inventories of raw materials, which provide the basis for future
production. It is measured gross of the depreciation of the assets,
i.e., it includes invesment that merely replaces worn-out or scrapped
capital.

Irrigated land:  This entry gives the number of square kilometers of
land area that is artificially supplied with water.

Judicial branch:  This entry contains the name(s) of the highest
court(s) and a brief description of the selection process for members.

Labor force:  This entry contains the total labor force figure.

Labor force - by occupation:  This entry lists the percentage
distribution of the labor force by occupation. The distribution will
total less than 100 percent if the data are incomplete.

Land boundaries:  This entry contains the total length of all land
boundaries and the individual lengths for each of the contiguous border
countries. When available, official lengths published by national
statistical agencies are used. Because surveying methods may differ,
country border lengths reported by contiguous countries may differ.

Land use:  This entry contains the percentage shares of total land area
for three different types of land use: arable land - land cultivated
for crops like wheat, maize, and rice that are replanted after each
harvest; permanent crops - land cultivated for crops like citrus,
coffee, and rubber that are not replanted after each harvest; includes
land under flowering shrubs, fruit trees, nut trees, and vines, but
excludes land under trees grown for wood or timber; other - any land
not arable or under permanent crops; includes permanent meadows and
pastures, forests and woodlands, built-on areas, roads, barren land,
etc.

Languages:  This entry provides a rank ordering of languages starting
with the largest and sometimes includes the percent of total population
speaking that language.

Legal system:  This entry contains a brief description of the legal
system's historical roots, role in government, and acceptance of
International Court of Justice (ICJ) jurisdiction.

Legislative branch:  This entry contains information on the structure
(unicameral, bicameral, tricameral), formal name, number of seats, and
term of office. Elections includes the nature of election process or
accession to power, date of the last election, and date of the next
election. Election results includes the percent of vote and/or number
of seats held by each party in the last election.

Life expectancy at birth:  This entry contains the average number of
years to be lived by a group of people born in the same year, if
mortality at each age remains constant in the future. The entry
includes total population as well as the male and female components.
Life expectancy at birth is also a measure of overall quality of life
in a country and summarizes the mortality at all ages. It can also be
thought of as indicating the potential return on investment in human
capital and is necessary for the calculation of various actuarial
measures.

Literacy:  This entry includes a definition of literacy and Census
Bureau percentages for the total population, males, and females. There
are no universal definitions and standards of literacy. Unless
otherwise specified, all rates are based on the most common definition
- the ability to read and write at a specified age. Detailing the
standards that individual countries use to assess the ability to read
and write is beyond the scope of the Factbook. Information on literacy,
while not a perfect measure of educational results, is probably the
most easily available and valid for international comparisons. Low
levels of literacy, and education in general, can impede the economic
development of a country in the current rapidly changing, technology-
driven world.

Location:  This entry identifies the country's regional location,
neighboring countries, and adjacent bodies of water.

Major infectious diseases:  This entry lists major infectious diseases
likely to be encountered in countries where the risk of such diseases
is assessed to be very high as compared to the United States. These
infectious diseases represent risks to US government personnel
traveling to the specified country for a period of less than three
years. The degree of risk is assessed by considering the foreign nature
of these infectious diseases, their severity, and the probability of
being affected by the diseases present. The diseases listed do not
necessarily represent the total disease burden experienced by the local
population.
The risk to an individual traveler varies considerably by the specific
location, visit duration, type of activities, type of accommodations,
time of year, and other factors. Consultation with a travel medicine
physician is needed to evaluate individual risk and recommend
appropriate preventive measures such as vaccines.
Diseases are organized into the following six exposure categories shown
in italics and listed in typical descending order of risk. Note - The
sequence of exposure categories listed in individual country entries
may vary according to local conditions.

food or waterborne diseases acquired through eating or drinking on the
local economy:

Hepatitis A - viral disease that interferes with the functioning of the
liver; spread through consumption of food or water contaminated with
fecal matter, principally in areas of poor sanitation; victims exhibit
fever, jaundice, and diarrhea; 15% of victims will experience prolonged
symptoms over 6-9 months; vaccine available.

Hepatitis E - water-borne viral disease that interferes with the
functioning of the liver; most commonly spread through fecal
contamination of drinking water; victims exhibit jaundice, fatigue,
abdominal pain, and dark colored urine.

Typhoid fever - bacterial disease spread through contact with food or
water contaminated by fecal matter or sewage; victims exhibit sustained
high fevers; left untreated, mortality rates can reach 20%.

vectorborne diseases acquired through the bite of an infected
arthropod:

Malaria - caused by single-cell parasitic protozoa Plasmodium;
transmitted to humans via the bite of the female Anopheles mosquito;
parasites multiply in the liver attacking red blood cells resulting in
cycles of fever, chills, and sweats accompanied by anemia; death due to
damage to vital organs and interruption of blood supply to the brain;
endemic in 100, mostly tropical, countries with 90% of cases and the
majority of 1.5-2.5 million estimated annual deaths occurring in sub-
Saharan Africa.

Dengue fever - mosquito-borne (Aedes aegypti) viral disease associated
with urban environments; manifests as sudden onset of fever and severe
headache; occasionally produces shock and hemorrhage leading to death
in 5% of cases.

Yellow fever - mosquito-borne viral disease; severity ranges from
influenza-like symptoms to severe hepatitis and hemorrhagic fever;
occurs only in tropical South America and sub-Saharan Africa, where
most cases are reported; fatality rate is less than 20%.

Japanese Encephalitis - mosquito-borne (Culex tritaeniorhynchus) viral
disease associated with rural areas in Asia; acute encephalitis can
progress to paralysis, coma, and death; fatality rates 30%.

African Trypanosomiasis - caused by the parasitic protozoa Trypanosoma;
transmitted to humans via the bite of bloodsucking Tsetse flies;
infection leads to malaise and irregular fevers and, in advanced cases
when the parasites invade the central nervous system, coma and death;
endemic in 36 countries of sub-Saharan Africa; cattle and wild animals
act as reservoir hosts for the parasites.

Cutaneous Leishmaniasis - caused by the parasitic protozoa leishmania;
transmitted to humans via the bite of sandflies; results in skin
lesions that may become chronic; endemic in 88 countries; 90% of cases
occur in Iran, Afghanistan, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, and Peru; wild
and domesticated animals as well as humans can act as reservoirs of
infection.

Plague - bacterial disease transmitted by fleas normally associated
with rats; person-to-person airborne transmission also possible; recent
plague epidemics occurred in areas of Asia, Africa, and South America
associated with rural areas or small towns and villages; manifests as
fever, headache, and painfully swollen lymph nodes; disease progresses
rapidly and without antibiotic treatment leads to pneumonic form with a
death rate in excess of 50%.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever - tick-borne viral disease; infection
may also result from exposure to infected animal blood or tissue;
geographic distribution includes Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and
Eastern Europe; sudden onset of fever, headache, and muscle aches
followed by hemorrhaging in the bowels, urine, nose, and gums;
mortality rate is approximately 30%.

Rift Valley fever - viral disease affecting domesticated animals and
humans; transmission is by mosquito and other biting insects; infection
may also occur through handling of infected meat or contact with blood;
geographic distribution includes eastern and southern Africa where
cattle and sheep are raised; symptoms are generally mild with fever and
some liver abnormalities, but the disease may progress to hemorrhagic
fever, encephalitis, or ocular disease; fatality rates are low at about
1% of cases.

Chikungunya - mosquito-borne (Aedes aegypti) viral disease associated
with urban environments, similar to Dengue Fever; characterized by
sudden onset of fever, rash, and severe joint pain usually lasting 3-7
days, some cases result in persistent arthritis.

water contact diseases acquired through swimming or wading in
freshwater lakes, streams, and rivers:

Leptospirosis - bacterial disease that affects animals and humans;
infection occurs through contact with water, food, or soil contaminated
by animal urine; symptoms include high fever, severe headache,
vomiting, jaundice, and diarrhea; untreated, the disease can result in
kidney damage, liver failure, meningitis, or respiratory distress;
fatality rates are low but left untreated recovery can take months.

Schistosomiasis - caused by parasitic trematode flatworm Schistosoma;
fresh water snails act as intermediate host and release larval form of
parasite that penetrates the skin of people exposed to contaminated
water; worms mature and reproduce in the blood vessels, liver, kidneys,
and intestines releasing eggs, which become trapped in tissues
triggering an immune response; may manifest as either urinary or
intestinal disease resulting in decreased work or learning capacity;
mortality, while generally low, may occur in advanced cases usually due
to bladder cancer; endemic in 74 developing countries with 80% of
infected people living in sub-Saharan Africa; humans act as the
reservoir for this parasite.

aerosolized dust or soil contact disease acquired through inhalation of
aerosols contaminated with rodent urine:

Lassa fever - viral disease carried by rats of the genus Mastomys;
endemic in portions of West Africa; infection occurs through direct
contact with or consumption of food contaminated by rodent urine or
fecal matter containing virus particles; fatality rate can reach 50% in
epidemic outbreaks.

respiratory disease acquired through close contact with an infectious
person:

Meningococcal meningitis - bacterial disease causing an inflammation of
the lining of the brain and spinal cord; one of the most important
bacterial pathogens is Neisseria meningitidis because of its potential
to cause epidemics; symptoms include stiff neck, high fever, headaches,
and vomiting; bacteria are transmitted from person to person by
respiratory droplets and facilitated by close and prolonged contact
resulting from crowded living conditions, often with a seasonal
distribution; death occurs in 5-15% of cases, typically within 24-48
hours of onset of symptoms; highest burden of meningococcal disease
occurs in the hyperendemic region of sub-Saharan Africa known as the
"Meningitis Belt" which stretches from Senegal east to Ethiopia.

animal contact disease acquired through direct contact with local
animals:

Rabies - viral disease of mammals usually transmitted through the bite
of an infected animal, most commonly dogs; virus affects the central
nervous system causing brain alteration and death; symptoms initially
are non-specific fever and headache progressing to neurological
symptoms; death occurs within days of the onset of symptoms.


Manpower available for military service:  This entry gives the number
of males and females falling in the military age range for the country
and assumes that every individual is fit to serve.

Manpower fit for military service:  This entry gives the number of
males and females falling in the military age range for the country and
who are not otherwise disqualified for health reasons; accounts for the
health situation in the country and provides a more realistic estimate
of the actual number fit to serve.

Manpower reaching military service age annually:  This entry gives the
number of draft-age males and females entering the military manpower
pool in any given year and is a measure of the availability of draft-
age young adults.

Map references:  This entry includes the name of the Factbook reference
map on which a country may be found. The entry on Geographic
coordinates may be helpful in finding some smaller countries.

Maritime claims:  This entry includes the following claims, the
definitions of which are excerpted from the United Nations Convention
on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which alone contains the full and
definitive descriptions:

territorial sea - the sovereignty of a coastal state extends beyond its
land territory and internal waters to an adjacent belt of sea,
described as the territorial sea in the UNCLOS (Part II); this
sovereignty extends to the air space over the territorial sea as well
as its underlying seabed and subsoil; every state has the right to
establish the breadth of its territorial sea up to a limit not
exceeding 12 nautical miles; the normal baseline for measuring the
breadth of the territorial sea is the low-water line along the coast as
marked on large-scale charts officially recognized by the coastal
state; the UNCLOS describes specific rules for archipelagic states.

contiguous zone - according to the UNCLOS (Article 33), this is a zone
contiguous to a coastal state's territorial sea, over which it may
exercise the control necessary to: prevent infringement of its customs,
fiscal, immigration, or sanitary laws and regulations within its
territory or territorial sea; punish infringement of the above laws and
regulations committed within its territory or territorial sea; the
contiguous zone may not extend beyond 24 nautical miles from the
baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured
(e.g. the US has claimed a 12-nautical mile contiguous zone in addition
to its 12-nautical mile territorial sea).

exclusive economic zone (EEZ) - the UNCLOS (Part V) defines the EEZ as
a zone beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea in which a coastal
state has: sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring and
exploiting, conserving and managing the natural resources, whether
living or non-living, of the waters superjacent to the seabed and of
the seabed and its subsoil, and with regard to other activities for the
economic exploitation and exploration of the zone, such as the
production of energy from the water, currents, and winds; jurisdiction
with regard to the establishment and use of artificial islands,
installations, and structures; marine scientific research; the
protection and preservation of the marine environment; the outer limit
of the exclusive economic zone shall not exceed 200 nautical miles from
the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is
measured.

continental shelf - the UNCLOS (Article 76) defines the continental
shelf of a coastal state as comprising the seabed and subsoil of the
submarine areas that extend beyond its territorial sea throughout the
natural prolongation of its land territory to the outer edge of the
continental margin, or to a distance of 200 nautical miles from the
baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured
where the outer edge of the continental margin does not extend up to
that distance; the continental margin comprises the submerged
prolongation of the landmass of the coastal state, and consists of the
seabed and subsoil of the shelf, the slope and the rise; wherever the
continental margin extends beyond 200 nautical miles from the baseline,
coastal states may extend their claim to a distance not to exceed 350
nautical miles from the baseline or 100 nautical miles from the 2500
meter isobath; it does not include the deep ocean floor with its
oceanic ridges or the subsoil thereof.

exclusive fishing zone - while this term is not used in the UNCLOS,
some states (e.g., the United Kingdom) have chosen not to claim an EEZ,
but rather to claim jurisdiction over the living resources off their
coast; in such cases, the term exclusive fishing zone is often used;
the breadth of this zone is normally the same as the EEZ or 200
nautical miles.


Median age:  This entry is the age that divides a population into two
numerically equal groups; that is, half the people are younger than
this age and half are older. It is a single index that summarizes the
age distribution of a population. Currently, the median age ranges from
a low of about 15 in Uganda and Gaza Strip to 40 or more in several
European countries and Japan. See the entry for "Age structure" for the
importance of a young versus an older age structure and, by
implication, a low versus a higher median age.

Merchant marine:  Merchant marine may be defined as all ships engaged
in the carriage of goods; or all commercial vessels (as opposed to all
nonmilitary ships), which excludes tugs, fishing vessels, offshore oil
rigs, etc. This entry contains information in four fields - total,
ships by type, foreign-owned, and registered in other countries.

Total includes the number of ships (1,000 GRT or over), total DWT for
those ships, and total GRT for those ships. DWT or dead weight tonnage
is the total weight of cargo, plus bunkers, stores, etc., that a ship
can carry when immersed to the appropriate load line. GRT or gross
register tonnage is a figure obtained by measuring the entire sheltered
volume of a ship available for cargo and passengers and converting it
to tons on the basis of 100 cubic feet per ton; there is no stable
relationship between GRT and DWT.

Ships by type includes a listing of barge carriers, bulk cargo ships,
cargo ships, chemical tankers, combination bulk carriers, combination
ore/oil carriers, container ships, liquefied gas tankers, livestock
carriers, multifunctional large-load carriers, petroleum tankers,
passenger ships, passenger/cargo ships, railcar carriers, refrigerated
cargo ships, roll-on/roll-off cargo ships, short-sea passenger ships,
specialized tankers, and vehicle carriers.

Foreign-owned are ships that fly the flag of one country but belong to
owners in another.

Registered in other countries are ships that belong to owners in one
country but fly the flag of another.


Military:  This category includes the entries dealing with a country's
military structure, manpower, and expenditures.

Military - note:  This entry includes miscellaneous military
information of significance not included elsewhere.

Military branches:  This entry lists the service branches subordinate
to defense ministries or the equivalent (typically ground, naval, air,
and marine forces).

Military expenditures - dollar figure:  This entry gives spending on
defense programs in US dollars for the most recent year available;
dollar figures for military expenditures should be treated with caution
because of different price patterns and accounting methods among
nations, as well as wide variations in the strength of different
currencies.

Military expenditures - percent of GDP:  This entry gives spending on
defense programs for the most recent year available as a percent of
gross domestic product (GDP); the GDP is calculated on an exchange rate
basis, i.e., not in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP).

Military service age and obligation:  This entry gives the required
ages for voluntary or conscript military service and the length of
sevice obligation.

Money figures:  All money figures are expressed in contemporaneous US
dollars unless otherwise indicated.

National holiday:  This entry gives the primary national day of
celebration - usually independence day.

Nationality:  This entry provides the identifying terms for citizens -
noun and adjective.

Natural gas - consumption:  This entry is the total natural gas
consumed in cubic meters (cu m). The discrepancy between the amount of
natural gas produced and/or imported and the amount consumed and/or
exported is due to the omission of stock changes and other complicating
factors.

Natural gas - exports:  This entry is the total natural gas exported in
cubic meters (cu m).

Natural gas - imports:  This entry is the total natural gas imported in
cubic meters (cu m).

Natural gas - production:  This entry is the total natural gas produced
in cubic meters (cu m). The discrepancy between the amount of natural
gas produced and/or imported and the amount consumed and/or exported is
due to the omission of stock changes and other complicating factors.

Natural gas - proved reserves:  This entry is the stock of proved
reserves of natural gas in cubic meters (cu m). Proved reserves are
those quantities of natural gas, which, by analysis of geological and
engineering data, can be estimated with a high degree of confidence to
be commercially recoverable from a given date forward, from known
reservoirs and under current economic conditions.

Natural hazards:  This entry lists potential natural disasters.

Natural resources:  This entry lists a country's mineral, petroleum,
hydropower, and other resources of commercial importance.

Net migration rate:  This entry includes the figure for the difference
between the number of persons entering and leaving a country during the
year per 1,000 persons (based on midyear population). An excess of
persons entering the country is referred to as net immigration (e.g.,
3.56 migrants/1,000 population); an excess of persons leaving the
country as net emigration (e.g., -9.26 migrants/1,000 population). The
net migration rate indicates the contribution of migration to the
overall level of population change. High levels of migration can cause
problems such as increasing unemployment and potential ethnic strife
(if people are coming in) or a reduction in the labor force, perhaps in
certain key sectors (if people are leaving).

Oil - consumption:  This entry is the total oil consumed in barrels per
day (bbl/day). The discrepancy between the amount of oil produced
and/or imported and the amount consumed and/or exported is due to the
omission of stock changes, refinery gains, and other complicating
factors.

Oil - exports:  This entry is the total oil exported in barrels per day
(bbl/day), including both crude oil and oil products.

Oil - imports:  This entry is the total oil imported in barrels per day
(bbl/day), including both crude oil and oil products.

Oil - production:  This entry is the total oil produced in barrels per
day (bbl/day). The discrepancy between the amount of oil produced
and/or imported and the amount consumed and/or exported is due to the
omission of stock changes, refinery gains, and other complicating
factors.

Oil - proved reserves:  This entry is the stock of proved reserves of
crude oil in barrels (bbl). Proved reserves are those quantities of
petroleum which, by analysis of geological and engineering data, can be
estimated with a high degree of confidence to be commercially
recoverable from a given date forward, from known reservoirs and under
current economic conditions.

People:  This category includes the entries dealing with the
characteristics of the people and their society.

People - note:  This entry includes miscellaneous demographic
information of significance not included elsewhere.

Personal Names - Capitalization:  The Factbook capitalizes the surname
or family name of individuals for the convenience of our users who are
faced with a world of different cultures and naming conventions. The
need for capitalization, bold type, underlining, italics, or some other
indicator of the individual's surname is apparent in the following
examples: MAO Zedong, Fidel CASTRO Ruz, George W. BUSH, and TUNKU
SALAHUDDIN Abdul Aziz Shah ibni Al-Marhum Sultan Hisammuddin Alam Shah.
By knowing the surname, a short form without all capital letters can be
used with confidence as in President Castro, Chairman Mao, President
Bush, or Sultan Tunku Salahuddin. The same system of capitalization is
extended to the names of leaders with surnames that are not commonly
used such as Queen ELIZABETH II. For Vietnamese names, the given name
is capitalized because officials are referred to by their given name
rather than by their surname. For example, the president of Vietnam is
Tran Duc LUONG. His surname is Tran, but he is referred to by his given
name - President LUONG.

Personal Names - Spelling:  The romanization of personal names in the
Factbook normally follows the same transliteration system used by the
US Board on Geographic Names for spelling place names. At times,
however, a foreign leader expressly indicates a preference for, or the
media or official documents regularly use, a romanized spelling that
differs from the transliteration derived from the US Government
standard. In such cases, the Factbook uses the alternative spelling.

Personal Names - Titles:  The Factbook capitalizes any valid title (or
short form of it) immediately preceding a person's name. A title
standing alone is not capitalized. Examples: President PUTIN and
President BUSH are chiefs of state. In Russia, the president is chief
of state and the premier is the head of the government, while in the
US, the president is both chief of state and head of government.

Petroleum:  See entries under Oil.

Petroleum products:  See entries under Oil.

Pipelines:  This entry gives the lengths and types of pipelines for
transporting products like natural gas, crude oil, or petroleum
products.

Political parties and leaders:  This entry includes a listing of
significant political organizations and their leaders.

Political pressure groups and leaders:  This entry includes a listing
of organizations with leaders involved in politics, but not standing
for legislative election.

Population:  This entry gives an estimate from the US Bureau of the
Census based on statistics from population censuses, vital statistics
registration systems, or sample surveys pertaining to the recent past
and on assumptions about future trends. The total population presents
one overall measure of the potential impact of the country on the world
and within its region. Note: starting with the 1993 Factbook,
demographic estimates for some countries (mostly African) have
explicitly taken into account the effects of the growing impact of the
HIV/AIDS epidemic. These countries are currently: The Bahamas, Benin,
Botswana, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Burma, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon,
Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of
the Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Guyana, Haiti,
Honduras, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda,
South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, and
Zimbabwe.

Population below poverty line:  National estimates of the percentage of
the population falling below the poverty line are based on surveys of
sub-groups, with the results weighted by the number of people in each
group. Definitions of poverty vary considerably among nations. For
example, rich nations generally employ more generous standards of
poverty than poor nations.

Population growth rate:  The average annual percent change in the
population, resulting from a surplus (or deficit) of births over deaths
and the balance of migrants entering and leaving a country. The rate
may be positive or negative. The growth rate is a factor in determining
how great a burden would be imposed on a country by the changing needs
of its people for infrastructure (e.g., schools, hospitals, housing,
roads), resources (e.g., food, water, electricity), and jobs. Rapid
population growth can be seen as threatening by neighboring countries.

Ports and terminals:  This entry lists major ports and terminals
primarily on the basis of the amount of cargo tonnage shipped through
the facilities on an annual basis. In some instances, the number of
containers handled or ship visits were also considered.

Public debt:  This entry records the cumulatiive total of all
government borrowings less repayments that are denominated in a
country's home currency. Public debt should not be confused with
external debt, which reflects the foreign currency liabilities of both
the private and public sector and must be financed out of foreign
exchange earnings.

Radio broadcast stations:  This entry includes the total number of AM,
FM, and shortwave broadcast stations.

Railways:  This entry states the total route length of the railway
network and of its component parts by gauge: broad, standard, narrow,
and dual. Other gauges are listed under note.

Reference maps:  This section includes world and regional maps.

Refugees and internally displaced persons:  This entry includes those
persons residing in a country as refugees or internally displaced
persons (IDPs). The definition of a refugee according to a United
Nations Convention is "a person who is outside his/her country of
nationality or habitual residence; has a well-founded fear of
persecution because of his/her race, religion, nationality, membership
in a particular social group or political opinion; and is unable or
unwilling to avail himself/herself of the protection of that country,
or to return there, for fear of persecution." The UN established the
Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in 1950 to
handle refugee matters worldwide. The UN Relief and Works Agency for
Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) has a different,
operational definition for a Palestinian refugee: "a person whose
normal place of residence was Palestine during the period 1 June 1946
to 15 May 1948 and who lost both home and means of livelihood as a
result of the 1948 conflict." However, UNHCR also assists some 400,000
Palestinian refugees not covered under the UNRWA definition. The term
"internally displaced person" is not specifically covered in the UN
Convention; it is used to describe people who have fled their homes for
reasons similar to refugees, but who remain within their own national
territory and are subject to the laws of that state.

Religions:  This entry is an ordered listing of religions by adherents
starting with the largest group and sometimes includes the percent of
total population.

Reserves of foreign exchange and gold:  This entry gives the dollar
value for the stock of all financial assets that are available to the
central monetary authority for use in meeting a country's balance of
payments needs as of the end-date of the period specified. This
category includes not only foreign currency and gold, but also a
country's holdings of Special Drawing Rights in the International
Monetary Fund, and its reserve position in the Fund.

Roadways:  This entry gives the total length of the road network and
includes the length of the paved and unpaved portions.

Sex ratio:  This entry includes the number of males for each female in
five age groups - at birth, under 15 years, 15-64 years, 65 years and
over, and for the total population. Sex ratio at birth has recently
emerged as an indicator of certain kinds of sex discrimination in some
countries. For instance, high sex ratios at birth in some Asian
countries are now attributed to sex-selective abortion and infanticide
due to a strong preference for sons. This will affect future marriage
patterns and fertility patterns. Eventually, it could cause unrest
among young adult males who are unable to find partners.

Suffrage:  This entry gives the age at enfranchisement and whether the
right to vote is universal or restricted.

Telephone numbers:  All telephone numbers in The World Factbook consist
of the country code in brackets, the city or area code (where required)
in parentheses, and the local number. The one component that is not
presented is the international access code, which varies from country
to country. For example, an international direct dial telephone call
placed from the US to Madrid, Spain, would be as follows: 011 [34] (1)
577-xxxx, where 011 is the international access code for station-to-
station calls; 01 is for calls other than station-to-station calls,
[34] is the country code for Spain, (1) is the city code for Madrid,
577 is the local exchange, and xxxx is the local telephone number. An
international direct dial telephone call placed from another country to
the US would be as follows: international access code + [1] (202) 939-
xxxx, where [ 1] is the country code for the US, (202) is the area code
for Washington, DC, 939 is the local exchange, and xxxx is the local
telephone number.

main telephone lines in use.

Telephones - mobile cellular:  This entry gives the total number of
mobile cellular telephone subscribers.

Television broadcast stations:  This entry gives the total number of
separate broadcast stations plus any repeater stations.

Terminology:  Due to the highly structured nature of the Factbook
database, some collective generic terms have to be used. For example,
the word Country in the Country name entry refers to a wide variety of
dependencies, areas of special sovereignty, uninhabited islands, and
other entities in addition to the traditional countries or independent
states. Military is also used as an umbrella term for various civil
defense, security, and defense activities in many entries. The
Independence entry includes the usual colonial independence dates and
former ruling states as well as other significant nationhood dates such
as the traditional founding date or the date of unification,
federation, confederation, establishment, or state succession that are
not strictly independence dates. Dependent areas have the nature of
their dependency status noted in this same entry.

Terrain:  This entry contains a brief description of the topography.

Time Difference:  This entry is expressed in The World Factbook in two
ways. First, it is stated as the difference in hours between the
capital of an entity and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) during
Standard Time. Additionally, the difference in time between the capital
of an entity and that observed in Washington, D.C. is also provided.
Note that the time difference assumes both locations are simultaneously
observing Standard Time or Daylight Saving Time.

Time zones:  Ten countries (Australia, Brazil, Canada, Indonesia,
Kazakhstan, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Spain, and the United States)
and the island of Greenland observe more than one official time
depending on the number of designated time zones within their
boundaries. An illustration of time zones throughout the world and
within countries can be seen in the Standard Time Zones of the World
map included in the Reference Maps section of The World Factbook.

Total fertility rate:  This entry gives a figure for the average number
of children that would be born per woman if all women lived to the end
of their childbearing years and bore children according to a given
fertility rate at each age. The total fertility rate (TFR) is a more
direct measure of the level of fertility than the crude birth rate,
since it refers to births per woman. This indicator shows the potential
for population change in the country. A rate of two children per woman
is considered the replacement rate for a population, resulting in
relative stability in terms of total numbers. Rates above two children
indicate populations growing in size and whose median age is declining.
Higher rates may also indicate difficulties for families, in some
situations, to feed and educate their children and for women to enter
the labor force. Rates below two children indicate populations
decreasing in size and growing older. Global fertility rates are in
general decline and this trend is most pronounced in industrialized
countries, especially Western Europe, where populations are projected
to decline dramatically over the next 50 years.

Trafficking in persons:  Trafficking in persons is modern-day slavery,
involving victims who are forced, defrauded, or coerced into labor or
sexual exploitation. The International Labor Organization (ILO), the UN
agency charged with addressing labor standards, employment, and social
protection issues, estimates that 12.3 million people worldwide are
enslaved in forced labor, bonded labor, forced child labor, sexual
servitude, and involuntary servitude at any given time. Human
trafficking is a multi-dimensional threat, depriving people of their
human rights and freedoms, risking global health, promoting social
breakdown, inhibiting development by depriving countries of their human
capital, and helping fuel the growth of organized crime. In 2000, the
US Congress passed the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA),
reauthorized in 2003 and 2005, which provides tools for the US to
combat trafficking in persons, both domestically and abroad. One of the
law's key components is the creation of the US Department of State's
annual Trafficking in Persons Report, which assesses the government
response in some 150 countries with a significant number of victims
trafficked across their borders who are recruited, harbored,
transported, provided, or obtained for forced labor or sexual
exploitation. Countries in the annual report are rated in three tiers,
based on government efforts to combat trafficking. The countries
identified in this entry are those listed in the 2006 Trafficking in
Persons Report as Tier 2 Watch List or Tier 3 based on the following
definitions:

Tier 2 Watch List countries do not fully comply with the minimum
standards for the elimination of trafficking but are making significant
efforts to do so, and meet one of the following criteria:

1. they display a high or significantly increasing number victims,

2. they have failed to provide evidence of increasing efforts to combat
trafficking in persons, or,

3. they have committed to take action over the next year.

Tier 3 countries neither satisfy the minimum standards for the
elimination of trafficking nor demonstrate a significant effort to do
so. Countries in this tier are subject to potential non-humanitarian
and non-trade sanctions.

Transnational issues:  This category includes four entries - Disputes -
international, Refugees and internally displaced persons, Trafficking
in persons, and Illicit drugs - that deal with current issues going
beyond national boundaries.

Transportation:  This category includes the entries dealing with the
means for movement of people and goods.

Transportation - note:  This entry includes miscellaneous
transportation information of significance not included elsewhere.

UTC (Coordinated Universal Time):  See entry for Coordinated Universal
Time.

Unemployment rate:  This entry contains the percent of the labor force
that is without jobs. Substantial underemployment might be noted.

Waterways:  This entry gives the total length of navigable rivers,
canals, and other inland bodies of water.

Weights and Measures:  This information is presented in Appendix G:
Weights and Measures and includes mathematical notations (mathematical
powers and names), metric interrelationships (prefix; symbol; length,
weight, or capacity; area; volume), and standard conversion factors.

Years:  All year references are for the calendar year (CY) unless
indicated as fiscal year (FY). The calendar year is an accounting
period of 12 months from 1 January to 31 December. The fiscal year is
an accounting period of 12 months other than 1 January to 31 December.

CIA - The World Factbook -- History


A Brief History of Basic Intelligence and The World Factbook

The Intelligence Cycle is the process by which information is
acquired, converted into intelligence, and made available to
policymakers. Information is raw data from any source, data that may
be fragmentary, contradictory, unreliable, ambiguous, deceptive, or
wrong. Intelligence is information that has been collected,
integrated, evaluated, analyzed, and interpreted. Finished
intelligence is the final product of the Intelligence Cycle ready to
be delivered to the policymaker.

The three types of finished intelligence are: basic, current, and
estimative. Basic intelligence provides the fundamental and factual
reference material on a country or issue. Current intelligence
reports on new developments. Estimative intelligence judges probable
outcomes. The three are mutually supportive: basic intelligence is
the foundation on which the other two are constructed; current
intelligence continually updates the inventory of knowledge; and
estimative intelligence revises overall interpretations of country
and issue prospects for guidance of basic and current intelligence.
The World Factbook, The President's Daily Brief, and the National
Intelligence Estimates are examples of the three types of finished
intelligence.

The United States has carried on foreign intelligence activities
since the days of George Washington but only since World War II have
they been coordinated on a government-wide basis. Three programs
have highlighted the development of coordinated basic intelligence
since that time: (1 ) the Joint Army Navy Intelligence Studies
(JANIS), (2 ) the National Intelligence Survey (NIS), and (3) The
World Factbook.

During World War II, intelligence consumers realized that the
production of basic intelligence by different components of the US
Government resulted in a great duplication of effort and conflicting
information. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 brought
home to leaders in Congress and the executive branch the need for
integrating departmental reports to national policymakers. Detailed
and coordinated information was needed not only on such major powers
as Germany and Japan, but also on places of little previous
interest. In the Pacific Theater, for example, the Navy and Marines
had to launch amphibious operations against many islands about which
information was unconfirmed or nonexistent. Intelligence authorities
resolved that the United States should never again be caught
unprepared.

In 1943, Gen. George B. Strong (G-2), Adm. H. C. Train (Office of
Naval Intelligence - ONI), and Gen. William J. Donovan (Director of
the Office of Strategic Services - OSS) decided that a joint effort
should be initiated. A steering committee was appointed on 27 April
1943 that recommended the formation of a Joint Intelligence Study
Publishing Board to assemble, edit, coordinate, and publish the
Joint Army Navy Intelligence Studies (JANIS). JANIS was the first
interdepartmental basic intelligence program to fulfill the needs of
the US Government for an authoritative and coordinated appraisal of
strategic basic intelligence. Between April 1943 and July 1947, the
board published 34 JANIS studies. JANIS performed well in the war
effort, and numerous letters of commendation were received,
including a statement from Adm. Forrest Sherman, Chief of Staff,
Pacific Ocean Areas, which said, "JANIS has become the indispensable
reference work for the shore-based planners."

The need for more comprehensive basic intelligence in the postwar
world was well expressed in 1946 by George S. Pettee, a noted author
on national security. He wrote in The Future of American Secret
Intelligence (Infantry Journal Press, 1946, page 46) that world
leadership in peace requires even more elaborate intelligence than
in war. "The conduct of peace involves all countries, all human
activities - not just the enemy and his war production."

The Central Intelligence Agency was established on 26 July 1947 and
officially began operating on 18 September 1947. Effective 1 October
1947, the Director of Central Intelligence assumed operational
responsibility for JANIS. On 13 January 1948, the National Security
Council issued Intelligence Directive (NSCID) No. 3, which
authorized the National Intelligence Survey (NIS) program as a
peacetime replacement for the wartime JANIS program. Before adequate
NIS country sections could be produced, government agencies had to
develop more comprehensive gazetteers and better maps. The US Board
on Geographic Names (BGN) compiled the names; the Department of the
Interior produced the gazetteers; and CIA produced the maps.
The Hoover Commission's Clark Committee, set up in 1954 to study the
structure and administration of the CIA, reported to Congress in
1955 that: "The National Intelligence Survey is an invaluable
publication which provides the essential elements of basic
intelligence on all areas of the world. There will always be a
continuing requirement for keeping the Survey up-to-date." The
Factbook was created as an annual summary and update to the
encyclopedic NIS studies. The first classified Factbook was
published in August 1962, and the first unclassified version was
published in June 1971. The NIS program was terminated in 1973
except for the Factbook, map, and gazetteer components. The 1975
Factbook was the first to be made available to the public with sales
through the US Government Printing Office (GPO). The Factbook was
first made available on the Internet in June 1997. The year 2007
marks the 60th anniversary of the establishment of the Central
Intelligence Agency and the 64th year of continuous basic
intelligence support to the US Government by The World Factbook and
its two predecessor programs.

I can't find a geographic name for a particular country. Why not?

The World Factbook is not a gazetteer (a dictionary or index of
places, usually with descriptive or statistical information) and
cannot provide more than the names of the administrative divisions
(in the Government category) and major cities/towns (on the country
maps). Our expanded Cross-Reference List of Geographic Names,
however, includes many of the world's major geographic features as
well as historic (former) names of countries and cities mentioned in
The World Factbook.

Why are Taiwan and the European Union listed out of alphabetical
order at the end of the Factbook entries?

Taiwan is listed after the regular entries because even though the
mainland People's Republic of China claims Taiwan, elected Taiwanese
authorities de facto administer the island and reject mainland
sovereignty claims. With the establishment of diplomatic relations
with China on January 1, 1979, the US Government recognized the
People's Republic of China as the sole legal government of China,
acknowledging the Chinese position that there is only one China and
that Taiwan is part of China.

The European Union (EU) is not a country, but it has taken on many
nation-like attributes and these are likely to be expanded in the
future. A more complete explanation on the inclusion of the EU into
the Factbook may be found in the Preliminary statement.

Since we have an ambassador who represents the US at the Vatican,
why is this entity not listed in the Factbook?

Vatican City is found under Holy See. The term "Holy See" refers to
the authority, jurisdiction, and sovereignty vested in the Pope and
his advisors to direct the worldwide Catholic Church. The Holy See
has a legal personality that allows it to enter into treaties as the
juridical equal of a state and to send and receive diplomatic
representatives. Vatican City, created in 1929 to administer
properties belonging to the Holy See in Rome, is recognized under
international law as a sovereign state, but it does not send or
receive diplomatic representatives. Consequently, Holy See is
included as a Factbook entry, with Vatican City cross-referenced in
the Geographic Names appendix.

Why is Palestine not listed in The World Factbook?

The areas that could potentially form a future Palestinian state --
the West Bank and Gaza Strip -- do appear in the Factbook. These
areas are presently Israeli-occupied with current status subject to
the Israeli-Palestinian 1995 Interim Agreement; their permanent
status is to be determined through further negotiation.

Why are the Golan Heights not shown as part of Israel or Northern
Cyprus with Turkey?

Territorial occupations/annexations not recognized by the United
States Government are not shown on US Government maps.

Why don't you include information on entities such as Tibet,
Kashmir, or Kosovo?

The World Factbook provides information on the administrative
divisions of a country as recommended by the United States Board on
Geographic Names (BGN). The BGN is a component of the US Government
that develops policies, principles, and procedures governing the
spelling, use, and application of geographic names--domestic,
foreign, Antarctic, and undersea. Its decisions enable all
departments and agencies of the US Government to have access to
uniform names of geographic features.

Also included in the Factbook are entries on parts of the world
whose status has not yet been resolved (e.g., West Bank, Spratly
Islands). Specific regions within a country or areas in dispute
among countries are not covered.

What do you mean when you say that a country is "doubly landlocked"?
A doubly landlocked country is one that is separated from an ocean
or an ocean-accessible sea by two intervening countries. Uzbekistan
and Liechtenstein are the only countries that fit this definition.

Why is the area of the United States described as "slightly larger
than China" in the Factbook, while other sources list China as
larger in area than the United States?

It all depends on whether one is looking at total area (land and
water) when making the comparison (which is the criterion used by
the Factbook) or just land area (which excludes inland water
features such as rivers or lakes).

Total area (combining land and water)

United States = 9,631,418 sq km
China = 9,596,960 sq km

Land only (without any water features)

United States = 9,161,923 sq km
China = 9,326,410 sq km

Why has The World Factbook dropped the four French departments of
Guadeloupe, Martinique, Reunion, and French Guiana?

The reason the four entities are no longer in The World Factbook is
because their status has changed. While they are overseas
departments of France, they are also now recognized as French
regions, having equal status to the 22 metropolitan regions that
make up European France. In other words, they are now recognized as
being part of France proper. Their status is somewhat analogous to
Alaska and Hawaii vis-a-vis the contiguous United States. Although
separated from the larger geographic entity, they are still
considered to be an integral part of it.


Spelling and Pronunciation

Why is the spelling of proper names such as rulers, presidents, and
prime ministers in The World Factbook different than their spelling
in my country?

The Factbook staff applies the names and spellings from the Chiefs
of State link on the CIA Web site. The World Factbook is prepared
using the standard American English computer keyboard and does not
use any special characters, symbols, or most diacritical markings in
its spellings. Surnames are always spelled with capital letters;
they may appear first in some cultures.

The spelling of geographic names, features, cities, administrative
divisions, etc. in the Factbook differs from those used in my
country. Why is this?

The United States Board on Geographic Names (BGN) recommends and
approves names and spellings. The BGN is the component of the United
States Government that develops policies, principles, and procedures
governing the spelling, use, and application of geographic
names--domestic, foreign, Antarctic, and undersea. Its decisions
enable all departments and agencies of the US Government to use
uniform names of geographic features. (A note is usually included
where changes may have occurred but have not yet been approved by
the BGN). The World Factbook is prepared using the standard American
English computer keyboard and does not use any special characters,
symbols, or most diacritical markings in its spellings.

Why doesn't The World Factbook include pronunciations of country or
leader names?

There are too many variations in pronunciation among
English-speaking countries, not to mention English renditions of
non-English names, for pronunciations to be included. American
English pronunciations are included for some countries like Qatar
and Kiribati.

Why is the name of the Labour party misspelled?

When American and British spellings of common English words differ,
The World Factbook always uses the American spelling, even when
these common words form part of a proper name in British English.


Policies and Procedures

What is The World Factbook's source for a specific subject field?

The Factbook staff uses many different sources to publish what we
judge are the most reliable and consistent data for any particular
category. Space considerations preclude a listing of these various
sources.

The names of some geographic features provided in the Factbook
differ from those used in other publications. For example, in Asia
the Factbook has Burma as the country name, but in other
publications Myanmar is used; also, the Factbook uses Sea of Japan
whereas other publications label it East Sea. What is your policy on
naming geographic features?

The Factbook staff follows the guidance of the United States Board
on Geographic Names (BGN). The BGN is the component of the United
States Government that develops policies, principles, and procedures
governing the spelling, use, and application of geographic
names--domestic, foreign, Antarctic, and undersea. Its decisions
enable all departments and agencies of the US Government to have
access to uniform names of geographic features. The position of the
BGN is that the names Burma and Sea of Japan be used in official US
Government maps and publications.

Why is most of the statistical information in the Factbook given in
metric units, rather than the units standard to US measure?

US Federal agencies are required by the Metric Conversion Act of
1975 (Public Law 94-168) and by Executive Order 12770 of July 1991
to use the International System of Units, commonly referred to as
the metric system or SI. In addition, the metric system is used by
over 95 percent of the world's population.

Why don't you include information on minimum and maximum temperature
extremes?

The Factbook staff judges that this information would only be useful
for some (generally smaller) countries. Larger countries can have
large temperature extremes that do not represent the landmass as a
whole. In the future, such a category may be adopted listing the
extremes, but also adding a normal temperature range found
throughout most of a country's territory.

What information sources are used for the country flags?

Flag designs used in The World Factbook are those recognized by the
protocol office of the US Department of State.

Why do your GDP (Gross Domestic Product) statistics differ from
other sources?

We have two sets of GDP dollar estimates in The World Factbook, one
derived from purchasing power parity (PPP) calculations and the
other derived using official exchange rates (OER). Other sources
probably use one of the two. See the Notes and Definitions section
on GDP and GDP methodology for more information.

On the CIA Web site, Chiefs of State is updated weekly, but the last
update for the Factbook was an earlier date. Why the discrepancy?

Although Chiefs of State and The World Factbook both appear on the
CIA Web site, they are produced and updated by separate staffs.
Chiefs of State includes fewer countries but more leaders, and is
updated more frequently than The World Factbook, which has a much
larger database, and includes all countries.

Some percentage distributions do not add to 100. Why not?

Because of rounding, percentage distributions do not always add
precisely to 100%. Rounding of numbers always results in a loss of
precision--i.e., error. This error becomes apparent when percentage
data are totaled, as the following two examples show:


                Original Data      Rounded to whole integer

Example 1                43.2                            43
                         30.4                            30
                         26.4                            26
                         ----                            --
                        100.0                            99

Example 2                42.8                            43
                         31.6                            32
                         25.6                            26
                         ----                            --
                        100.0                           101

When this occurs, we do not force the numbers to add exactly to 100,
because doing so would introduce additional error into the
distribution.

What rounding convention does The World Factbook use?

In deciding on the number of digits to present, the Factbook staff
assesses the accuracy of the original data and the needs of US
Government officials. All of the economic data are processed by
computer--either at the source or by the Factbook staff. The economic
data presented in The Factbook, therefore, follow the rounding
convention used by virtually all numerical software applications,
namely, any digit followed by a "5" is rounded up to the next higher
digit, no matter whether the original digit is even or odd. Thus,
for example, when rounded to the nearest integer, 2.5 becomes 3,
rather than 2, as occurred in some pre-computer rounding systems.

Why do you list "Independence" dates for countries like France,
Germany, and the United Kingdom?

For most countries, this entry presents the date that sovereignty
was achieved and from which nation, empire, or trusteeship. For
other countries, the date may be some other significant nationhood
event such as the traditional founding date or the date of
unification, federation, confederation, establishment, or state
succession and so may not strictly be an "Independence" date.
Dependent entities have the nature of their dependency status noted
in this same entry.


Technical

Does The World Factbook comply with Section 508 of the
Rehabilitation Act regarding accessibility of Web pages?

The World Factbook home page has a link entitled "Text/Low Bandwidth
Version." The country data in the text version is fully accessible.
We believe The World Factbook is compliant with the Section 508 law
in both fact and spirit. If you are experiencing difficulty, please
use our comment form to provide us details of the specific problem
you are experiencing and the assistive software and/or hardware that
you are using so that we can work with our technical support staff
to find and implement a solution. We welcome visitors' suggestions
to improve accessibility of The World Factbook and the CIA Web site.

I am using the Factbook online and it is not working. What is wrong?

Hundreds of "Factbook" look-alikes exist on the Internet. The
Factbook site at: www.cia.gov is the only official site.

When I attempt to download a PDF (Portable Document Format) map file
(or some other map) the file has no image. Can you fix this?

Some of the files on The World Factbook Web site are large and could
take several minutes to download on a dial-up connection. The screen
might be blank during the download process.

When I open a map on The World Factbook site, it is fuzzy or
granular, or too big or too small. Why?

Adjusting the resolution setting on your monitor should correct this
problem.

Is The World Factbook country data available in machine-readable
format? All I can find is HTML, but I'm looking for simple tabular
data.

The Factbook Web site now features "Rank Order" pages for selected
Factbook entries. "Rank Order" pages are available for those data
fields identified with a small bar chart icon located next to the
title of the data entry. In addition, all of the "Rank Order" pages
can be downloaded as tab-delimited data files that can be opened in
other applications such as spreadsheets and databases.

Introduction Afghanistan


Background:
  Ahmad Shah DURRANI unified the Pashtun tribes and founded
  Afghanistan in 1747. The country served as a buffer between the
  British and Russian empires until it won independence from notional
  British control in 1919. A brief experiment in democracy ended in a
  1973 coup and a 1978 Communist counter-coup. The Soviet Union
  invaded in 1979 to support the tottering Afghan Communist regime,
  touching off a long and destructive war. The USSR withdrew in 1989
  under relentless pressure by internationally supported
  anti-Communist mujahedin rebels. Subsequently, a series of civil
  wars saw Kabul finally fall in 1996 to the Taliban, a hardline
  Pakistani-sponsored movement that emerged in 1994 to end the
  country's civil war and anarchy. Following the 11 September 2001
  terrorist attacks, a US, Allied, and anti-Taliban Northern Alliance
  military action toppled the Taliban for sheltering Osama BIN LADIN.
  The UN-sponsored Bonn Conference in 2001 established a process for
  political reconstruction that included the adoption of a new
  constitution and a presidential election in 2004, and National
  Assembly elections in 2005. On 7 December 2004, Hamid KARZAI became
  the first democratically elected president of Afghanistan. The
  National Assembly was inaugurated on 19 December 2005.

Economy Afghanistan


Economy - overview:
  Afghanistan's economy is recovering from decades of conflict. The
  economy has improved significantly since the fall of the Taliban
  regime in 2001 largely because of the infusion of international
  assistance, the recovery of the agricultural sector, and service
  sector growth. Real GDP growth probably exceeded 8% in 2006. Despite
  the progress of the past few years, Afghanistan is extremely poor,
  landlocked, and highly dependent on foreign aid, agriculture, and
  trade with neighboring countries. Much of the population continues
  to suffer from shortages of housing, clean water, electricity,
  medical care, and jobs. Criminality, insecurity, and the Afghan
  Government's inability to extend rule of law to all parts of the
  country pose challenges to future economic growth. It will probably
  take the remainder of the decade and continuing donor aid and
  attention to significantly raise Afghanistan's living standards from
  its current status, among the lowest in the world. While the
  international community remains committed to Afghanistan's
  development, pledging over $24 billion at three donors' conferences
  since 2002, Kabul will need to overcome a number of challenges.
  Expanding poppy cultivation and a growing opium trade generate
  roughly $3 billion in illicit economic activity and looms as one of
  Kabul's most serious policy concerns. Other long-term challenges
  include: budget sustainability, job creation, corruption, government
  capacity, and rebuilding war torn infrastructure.

  encroachments; regional conflicts over water-sharing arrangements
  with Amu Darya and Helmand River states

  west due to drought and instability) (2006)

Illicit drugs:
  world's largest producer of opium; cultivation dropped 48% to
  107,400 hectares in 2005; better weather and lack of widespread
  disease returned opium yields to normal levels, meaning potential
  opium production declined by only 10% to 4,475 metric tons; if the
  entire poppy crop were processed, it is estimated that 526 metric
  tons of heroin could be processed; source of hashish; many
  narcotics-processing labs throughout the country; drug trade source
  of instability and some antigovernment groups profit from the trade;
  80-90% of the heroin consumed in Europe comes from Afghan opium;
  vulnerable to narcotics money laundering through informal financial
  networks

@Albania

Introduction Albania


Background:
  Between 1990 and 1992 Albania ended 46 years of xenophobic
  Communist rule and established a multiparty democracy. The
  transition has proven challenging as successive governments have
  tried to deal with high unemployment, widespread corruption, a
  dilapidated physical infrastructure, powerful organized crime
  networks, and combative political opponents. Albania has made
  progress in its democratic development since first holding
  multiparty elections in 1991, but deficiencies remain. International
  observers judged elections to be largely free and fair since the
  restoration of political stability following the collapse of pyramid
  schemes in 1997. In the 2005 general elections, the Democratic Party
  and its allies won a decisive victory on pledges of reducing crime
  and corruption, promoting economic growth, and decreasing the size
  of government. The election, and particularly the orderly transition
  of power, was considered an important step forward. Although
  Albania's economy continues to grow, the country is still one of the
  poorest in Europe, hampered by a large informal economy and an
  inadequate energy and transportation infrastructure. Albania has
  played a largely helpful role in managing inter-ethnic tensions in
  southeastern Europe, and is continuing to work toward joining NATO
  and the EU. Albania, with troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, has been a
  strong supporter of the global war on terrorism.

Economy Albania


Economy - overview:
  Lagging behind its Balkan neighbors, Albania is making the
  difficult transition to a more modern open-market economy. The
  government has taken measures to curb violent crime and reduce the
  large grey economy. The economy is bolstered by annual remittances
  from abroad of $600-$800 million, mostly from Albanians residing in
  Greece and Italy; this helps offset the towering trade deficit.
  Agriculture, which accounts for about one-quarter of GDP, is held
  back because of lack of modern equipment, unclear property rights,
  and the prevalence of small, inefficient plots of land. Energy
  shortages and antiquated and inadequate infrastructure contribute to
  Albania's poor business environment, which make it difficult to
  attract and sustain foreign investment. The planned construction of
  a new thermal power plant near Vlore and improved transmission and
  distribution facilities eventually will help relieve the energy
  shortages. Also, the government is moving slowly to improve the poor
  national road and rail network, a long-standing barrier to sustained
  economic growth. On the positive side: growth was strong in 2003-06
  and inflation is low and stable.

  widespread and generally effective
  domestic: offsetting the shortage of fixed line capacity, mobile
  phone service has been available since 1996; by 2003 two companies
  were providing mobile services at a greater density than some of
  Albania's Balkan neighbors
  international: country code - 355; inadequate fixed main lines;

Transnational Issues Albania


Disputes - international:
  the Albanian Government calls for the protection of the rights of
  ethnic Albanians in neighboring countries, and the peaceful
  resolution of interethnic disputes; some ethnic Albanian groups in
  neighboring countries advocate for a "greater Albania," but the idea
  has little appeal among Albanian nationals; thousands of unemployed
  Albanians emigrate annually to nearby Italy and other developed
  countries

Illicit drugs:
  increasingly active transshipment point for Southwest Asian
  opiates, hashish, and cannabis transiting the Balkan route and - to
  a far lesser extent - cocaine from South America destined for
  Western Europe; limited opium and growing cannabis production;
  ethnic Albanian narcotrafficking organizations active and expanding
  in Europe; vulnerable to money laundering associated with regional
  trafficking in narcotics, arms, contraband, and illegal aliens

Introduction Algeria


Background:
  After more than a century of rule by France, Algerians fought
  through much of the 1950s to achieve independence in 1962. Algeria's
  primary political party, the National Liberation Front (FLN), has
  dominated politics ever since. Many Algerians in the subsequent
  generation were not satisfied, however, and moved to counter the
  FLN's centrality in Algerian politics. The surprising first round
  success of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) in the December 1991
  balloting spurred the Algerian army to intervene and postpone the
  second round of elections to prevent what the secular elite feared
  would be an extremist-led government from assuming power. The army
  began a crack down on the FIS that spurred FIS supporters to begin
  attacking government targets. The government later allowed elections
  featuring pro-government and moderate religious-based parties, but
  did not appease the activists who progressively widened their
  attacks. The fighting escalated into an insurgency, which saw
  intense fighting between 1992-98 and which resulted in over 100,000
  deaths - many attributed to indiscriminate massacres of villagers by
  extremists. The government gained the upper hand by the late-1990s
  and FIS's armed wing, the Islamic Salvation Army, disbanded in
  January 2000. However, small numbers of armed militants persist in
  confronting government forces and conducting ambushes and occasional
  attacks on villages. The army placed Abdelaziz BOUTEFLIKA in the
  presidency in 1999 in a fraudulent election but claimed neutrality
  in his 2004 landslide reelection victory. Longstanding problems
  continue to face BOUTEFLIKA in his second term, including the ethnic
  minority Berbers' ongoing autonomy campaign, large-scale
  unemployment, a shortage of housing, unreliable electrical and water
  supplies, government inefficiencies and corruption, and the
  continuing - although significantly degraded - activities of
  extremist militants. Algeria must also diversify its petroleum-based
  economy, which has yielded a large cash reserve but which has not
  been used to redress Algeria's many social and infrastructure
  problems.

Economy Algeria


Economy - overview:
  The hydrocarbons sector is the backbone of the economy, accounting
  for roughly 60% of budget revenues, 30% of GDP, and over 95% of
  export earnings. Algeria has the seventh-largest reserves of natural
  gas in the world and is the second-largest gas exporter; it ranks
  14th in oil reserves. Sustained high oil prices in recent years,
  along with macroeconomic policy reforms supported by the IMF, have
  helped improve Algeria's financial and macroeconomic indicators.
  Algeria is running substantial trade surpluses and building up
  record foreign exchange reserves. Algeria has decreased its external
  debt to less than 10% of GDP after repaying its Paris Club and
  London Club debt in 2006. Real GDP has risen due to higher oil
  output and increased government spending. The government's continued
  efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic
  investment outside the energy sector, however, has had little
  success in reducing high unemployment and improving living
  standards. Structural reform within the economy, such as development
  of the banking sector and the construction of infrastructure, moves
  ahead slowly hampered by corruption and bureaucratic resistance.

Transnational Issues Algeria


Disputes - international:
  Algeria supports the exiled Sahrawi Polisario Front and rejects
  Moroccan administration of Western Sahara; most of the approximately
  102,000 Western Saharan Sahrawi refugees are sheltered in camps in
  Tindouf, Algeria; Algeria's border with Morocco remains an irritant
  to bilateral relations, each nation accusing the other of harboring
  militants and arms smuggling; in an attempt to improve relations,
  Morocco, in mid-2004, unilaterally lifted the requirement that
  Algerians visiting Morocco possess entry visas - a gesture not
  reciprocated by Algeria; Algeria remains concerned about armed
  bandits operating throughout the Sahel who sometimes destabilize
  southern Algerian towns; dormant disputes include Libyan claims of
  about 32,000 sq km still reflected on its maps of southeastern
  Algeria and the FLN's assertions of a claim to Chirac Pastures in
  southeastern Morocco

Refugees and internally displaced persons:
  refugees (country of origin): 90,000 (Western Saharan Sahrawi,
  mostly living in Algerian-sponsored camps in the southwestern
  Algerian town of Tindouf)
  IDPs: 400,000-600,000 (conflict between government forces, Islamic
  insurgents) (2006)

Trafficking in persons:
  current situation: Algeria is a transit and destination country for
  men, women, and children from sub-Saharan Africa and Asia trafficked
  for forced labor and sexual exploitation; many victims willingly
  migrate to Algeria en route to European countries with the help of
  smugglers, where they are often forced into prostitution, labor, and
  begging to pay off their smuggling debt; armed militants reportedly
  traffic women for sexual exploitation and involuntary servitude, and
  children may be trafficked for forced labor as domestic servants or
  street vendors
  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Algeria took no steps to assess the
  scope of trafficking in the country and reported no investigations
  or prosecutions for trafficking offenses this year

@American Samoa

Introduction American Samoa


Background:
  Settled as early as 1000 B.C., Samoa was "discovered" by European
  explorers in the 18th century. International rivalries in the latter
  half of the 19th century were settled by an 1899 treaty in which
  Germany and the US divided the Samoan archipelago. The US formally
  occupied its portion - a smaller group of eastern islands with the
  excellent harbor of Pago Pago - the following year.

Economy American Samoa


Economy - overview:
  American Samoa has a traditional Polynesian economy in which more
  than 90% of the land is communally owned. Economic activity is
  strongly linked to the US with which American Samoa conducts most of
  its foreign trade. Tuna fishing and tuna processing plants are the
  backbone of the private sector, with canned tuna the primary export.
  Transfers from the US Government add substantially to American
  Samoa's economic well being. Attempts by the government to develop a
  larger and broader economy are restrained by Samoa's remote
  location, its limited transportation, and its devastating
  hurricanes. Tourism is a promising developing sector.

@Andorra

Introduction Andorra


Background:
  For 715 years, from 1278 to 1993, Andorrans lived under a unique
  co-principality, ruled by French and Spanish leaders (from 1607
  onward, the French chief of state and the Spanish bishop of Urgel).
  In 1993, this feudal system was modified with the titular heads of
  state retained, but the government transformed into a parliamentary
  democracy. Long isolated and impoverished, mountainous Andorra
  achieved considerable prosperity since World War II through its
  tourist industry. Many immigrants (legal and illegal) are attracted
  to the thriving economy with its lack of income taxes.

Economy Andorra


Economy - overview:
  Tourism, the mainstay of Andorra's tiny, well-to-do economy,
  accounts for more than 80% of GDP. An estimated 11.6 million
  tourists visit annually, attracted by Andorra's duty-free status and
  by its summer and winter resorts. Andorra's comparative advantage
  has recently eroded as the economies of neighboring France and Spain
  have been opened up, providing broader availability of goods and
  lower tariffs. The banking sector, with its partial "tax haven"
  status, also contributes substantially to the economy. Agricultural
  production is limited - only 2% of the land is arable - and most
  food has to be imported. The principal livestock activity is sheep
  raising. Manufacturing output consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars,
  and furniture. Andorra is a member of the EU Customs Union and is
  treated as an EU member for trade in manufactured goods (no tariffs)
  and as a non-EU member for agricultural products.

Introduction Angola


Background:
  Angola is slowly rebuilding its country after the end of a 27-year
  civil war in 2002. Fighting between the Popular Movement for the
  Liberation of Angola (MPLA), led by Jose Eduardo DOS SANTOS, and the
  National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), led by
  Jonas SAVIMBI, followed independence from Portugal in 1975. Peace
  seemed imminent in 1992 when Angola held national elections, but
  UNITA renewed fighting after being beaten by the MPLA at the polls.
  Up to 1.5 million lives may have been lost - and 4 million people
  displaced - in the quarter century of fighting. SAVIMBI's death in
  2002 ended UNITA's insurgency and strengthened the MPLA's hold on
  power. DOS SANTOS has pledged to hold legislative elections in 2007,
  but 2008 may be more realistic.

Economy Angola


Economy - overview:
  Angola's high growth rate is driven by its oil sector, with record
  oil prices and rising petroleum production. Oil production and its
  supporting activities contribute about half of GDP and 90% of
  exports. Increased oil production supported 12% growth in 2004, 19%
  growth in 2005, and nearly 17% growth in 2006. A postwar
  reconstruction boom and resettlement of displaced persons has led to
  high rates of growth in construction and agriculture as well. Much
  of the country's infrastructure is still damaged or undeveloped from
  the 27-year-long civil war. Remnants of the conflict such as
  widespread land mines still mar the countryside even though an
  apparently durable peace was established after the death of rebel
  leader Jonas SAVIMBI in February 2002. Subsistence agriculture
  provides the main livelihood for half of the population, but half of
  the country's food must still be imported. In 2005, the government
  started using a $2 billion line of credit from China to rebuild
  Angola's public infrastructure, and several large-scale projects
  were completed in 2006. The central bank in 2003 implemented an
  exchange rate stabilization program using foreign exchange reserves
  to buy kwanzas out of circulation, a policy that was more
  sustainable in 2005 because of strong oil export earnings, and has
  significantly reduced inflation. Consumer inflation declined from
  325% in 2000 to about 13% in 2006, but the stabilization policy
  places pressure on international net liquidity. To fully take
  advantage of its rich national resources - gold, diamonds, extensive
  forests, Atlantic fisheries, and large oil deposits - Angola will
  need to continue reforming government policies and to reduce
  corruption. The government has made little progress on reforms
  recommended by the IMF such as promoting greater transparency in
  government spending and continues to be without a formal monitoring
  agreement with the institution. Corruption, especially in the
  extractive sectors, is a major challenge facing Angola.

@Anguilla

Introduction Anguilla


Background:
  Colonized by English settlers from Saint Kitts in 1650, Anguilla
  was administered by Great Britain until the early 19th century, when
  the island - against the wishes of the inhabitants - was
  incorporated into a single British dependency, along with Saint
  Kitts and Nevis. Several attempts at separation failed. In 1971, two
  years after a revolt, Anguilla was finally allowed to secede; this
  arrangement was formally recognized in 1980, with Anguilla becoming
  a separate British dependency.

Economy Anguilla


Economy - overview:
  Anguilla has few natural resources, and the economy depends heavily
  on luxury tourism, offshore banking, lobster fishing, and
  remittances from emigrants. Increased activity in the tourism
  industry, which has spurred the growth of the construction sector,
  has contributed to economic growth. Anguillan officials have put
  substantial effort into developing the offshore financial sector,
  which is small, but growing. In the medium term, prospects for the
  economy will depend largely on the tourism sector and, therefore, on
  revived income growth in the industrialized nations as well as on
  favorable weather conditions.

@Antarctica



Background:
  Speculation over the existence of a "southern land" was not
  confirmed until the early 1820s when British and American commercial
  operators and British and Russian national expeditions began
  exploring the Antarctic Peninsula region and other areas south of
  the Antarctic Circle. Not until 1840 was it established that
  Antarctica was indeed a continent and not just a group of islands.
  Several exploration "firsts" were achieved in the early 20th
  century. Following World War II, there was an upsurge in scientific
  research on the continent. A number of countries have set up
  year-round research stations on Antarctica. Seven have made
  territorial claims, but not all countries recognize these claims. In
  order to form a legal framework for the activities of nations on the
  continent, an Antarctic Treaty was negotiated that neither denies
  nor gives recognition to existing territorial claims; signed in
  1959, it entered into force in 1961.

Geography Antarctica


Location:
  continent mostly south of the Antarctic Circle

Geographic coordinates:
  90 00 S, 0 00 E

Map references:
  Antarctic Region

Area:
  total: 14 million sq km
  land: 14 million sq km (280,000 sq km ice-free, 13.72 million sq km
  ice-covered) (est.)
  note: fifth-largest continent, following Asia, Africa, North
  America, and South America, but larger than Australia and the
  subcontinent of Europe

Area - comparative:
  slightly less than 1.5 times the size of the US

Land boundaries:
  0 km
  note: see entry on Disputes - international

Coastline:
  17,968 km

Maritime claims:
  Australia, Chile, and Argentina claim Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)
  rights or similar over 200 nm extensions seaward from their
  continental claims, but like the claims themselves, these zones are
  not accepted by other countries; 21 of 28 Antarctic consultative
  nations have made no claims to Antarctic territory (although Russia
  and the US have reserved the right to do so) and do not recognize
  the claims of the other nations; also see the Disputes -
  international entry

Climate:
  severe low temperatures vary with latitude, elevation, and distance
  from the ocean; East Antarctica is colder than West Antarctica
  because of its higher elevation; Antarctic Peninsula has the most
  moderate climate; higher temperatures occur in January along the
  coast and average slightly below freezing

Terrain:
  about 98% thick continental ice sheet and 2% barren rock, with
  average elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters; mountain ranges
  up to nearly 5,000 meters; ice-free coastal areas include parts of
  southern Victoria Land, Wilkes Land, the Antarctic Peninsula area,
  and parts of Ross Island on McMurdo Sound; glaciers form ice shelves
  along about half of the coastline, and floating ice shelves
  constitute 11% of the area of the continent

Elevation extremes:
  lowest point: Bentley Subglacial Trench -2,555 m
  highest point: Vinson Massif 4,897 m
  note: the lowest known land point in Antarctica is hidden in the
  Bentley Subglacial Trench; at its surface is the deepest ice yet
  discovered and the world's lowest elevation not under seawater

Natural resources:
  iron ore, chromium, copper, gold, nickel, platinum and other
  minerals, and coal and hydrocarbons have been found in small
  uncommercial quantities; none presently exploited; krill, finfish,
  and crab have been taken by commercial fisheries

Land use:
  arable land: 0%
  permanent crops: 0%
  other: 100% (ice 98%, barren rock 2%) (2005)

Natural hazards:
  katabatic (gravity-driven) winds blow coastward from the high
  interior; frequent blizzards form near the foot of the plateau;
  cyclonic storms form over the ocean and move clockwise along the
  coast; volcanism on Deception Island and isolated areas of West
  Antarctica; other seismic activity rare and weak; large icebergs may
  calve from ice shelf

Environment - current issues:
  in 1998, NASA satellite data showed that the Antarctic ozone hole
  was the largest on record, covering 27 million square kilometers;
  researchers in 1997 found that increased ultraviolet light passing
  through the hole damages the DNA of icefish, an Antarctic fish
  lacking hemoglobin; ozone depletion earlier was shown to harm
  one-celled Antarctic marine plants; in 2002, significant areas of
  ice shelves disintegrated in response to regional warming

Geography - note:
  the coldest, windiest, highest (on average), and driest continent;
  during summer, more solar radiation reaches the surface at the South
  Pole than is received at the Equator in an equivalent period; mostly
  uninhabitable

People Antarctica


Population:
  no indigenous inhabitants, but there are both permanent and
  summer-only staffed research stations
  note: 26 nations, all signatory to the Antarctic Treaty, operate
  through their National Antarctic Program a number of seasonal-only
  (summer) and year-round research stations on the continent and its
  nearby islands south of 60 degrees south latitude (the region
  covered by the Antarctic Treaty); these stations' population of
  persons doing and supporting science or engaged in the management
  and protection of the Antarctic region varies from approximately
  4,000 in summer to 1,000 in winter; in addition, approximately 1,000
  personnel, including ship's crew and scientists doing onboard
  research, are present in the waters of the treaty region; peak
  summer (December-February) population - 3,822 total; Argentina 417,

  Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (1980); a mineral
  resources agreement was signed in 1988 but remains unratified; the
  Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty was
  signed 4 October 1991 and entered into force 14 January 1998; this
  agreement provides for the protection of the Antarctic environment
  through six specific annexes: 1) environmental impact assessment, 2)
  conservation of Antarctic fauna and flora, 3) waste disposal and
  waste management, 4) prevention of marine pollution, 5) area
  protection and management and 6) liability arising from
  environmental emergencies; it prohibits all activities relating to
  mineral resources except scientific research; a permanent Antarctic
  Treaty Secretariat was established in 2004 in Buenos Aires, Argentina

Legal system:
  Antarctica is administered through meetings of the consultative
  member nations; decisions from these meetings are carried out by
  these member nations (with respect to their own nationals and
  operations) in accordance with their own national laws; US law,
  including certain criminal offenses by or against US nationals, such
  as murder, may apply extraterritorially; some US laws directly apply
  to Antarctica; for example, the Antarctic Conservation Act, 16
  U.S.C. section 2401 et seq., provides civil and criminal penalties
  for the following activities, unless authorized by regulation of
  statute: the taking of native mammals or birds; the introduction of
  nonindigenous plants and animals; entry into specially protected
  areas; the discharge or disposal of pollutants; and the importation
  into the US of certain items from Antarctica; violation of the
  Antarctic Conservation Act carries penalties of up to $10,000 in
  fines and one year in prison; the National Science Foundation and
  Department of Justice share enforcement responsibilities; Public Law
  95-541, the US Antarctic Conservation Act of 1978, as amended in
  1996, requires expeditions from the US to Antarctica to notify, in
  advance, the Office of Oceans, Room 5805, Department of State,
  Washington, DC 20520, which reports such plans to other nations as
  required by the Antarctic Treaty; for more information, contact
  Permit Office, Office of Polar Programs, National Science
  Foundation, Arlington, Virginia 22230; telephone: (703) 292-8030, or
  visit their website at www.nsf.gov; more generally, access to the
  Antarctic Treaty area, that is to all areas between 60 and 90
  degrees south latitude, is subject to a number of relevant legal
  instruments and authorization procedures adopted by the states party
  to the Antarctic Treaty

Economy Antarctica


Economy - overview:
  Fishing off the coast and tourism, both based abroad, account for
  Antarctica's limited economic activity. Antarctic fisheries in
  2003-04 (1 July-30 June) reported landing 136,262 metric tons
  (estimated fishing from the area covered by the Convention on the
  Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), which
  extends slightly beyond the Antarctic Treaty area). Unregulated
  fishing, particularly of Patagonian toothfish, is a serious problem.
  The CCAMLR determines the recommended catch limits for marine
  species. A total of 23,175 tourists visited in the 2004-05 Antarctic
  summer, up from the 19,486 visitors the previous year. Nearly all of
  them were passengers on commercial (nongovernmental) ships and
  several yachts that make trips during the summer. Most tourist trips
  last approximately two weeks.

@Antigua and Barbuda

Introduction Antigua and Barbuda


Background:
  The Siboney were the first to inhabit the islands of Antigua and
  Barbuda in 2400 B.C., but Arawak Indians populated the islands when
  Columbus landed on his second voyage in 1493. Early settlements by
  the Spanish and French were succeeded by the English who formed a
  colony in 1667. Slavery, established to run the sugar plantations on
  Antigua, was abolished in 1834. The islands became an independent
  state within the British Commonwealth of Nations in 1981.

Economy Antigua and Barbuda


Economy - overview:
  Tourism continues to dominate the economy, accounting for more than
  half of GDP. Weak tourist arrival numbers since early 2000 have
  slowed the economy and pressed the government into a tight fiscal
  corner. The dual-island nation's agricultural production is focused
  on the domestic market and constrained by a limited water supply and
  a labor shortage stemming from the lure of higher wages in tourism
  and construction. Manufacturing comprises enclave-type assembly for
  export with major products being bedding, handicrafts, and
  electronic components. Prospects for economic growth in the medium
  term will continue to depend on income growth in the industrialized
  world, especially in the US, which accounts for slightly more than
  one-third of tourist arrivals.

@Arctic Ocean



Background:
  The Arctic Ocean is the smallest of the world's five oceans (after
  the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, and the recently
  delimited Southern Ocean). The Northwest Passage (US and Canada) and
  Northern Sea Route (Norway and Russia) are two important seasonal
  waterways. A sparse network of air, ocean, river, and land routes
  circumscribes the Arctic Ocean.

Geography Arctic Ocean


Location:
  body of water between Europe, Asia, and North America, mostly north
  of the Arctic Circle

Geographic coordinates:
  90 00 N, 0 00 E

Map references:
  Arctic Region

Area:
  total: 14.056 million sq km
  note: includes Baffin Bay, Barents Sea, Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea,
  East Siberian Sea, Greenland Sea, Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Kara
  Sea, Laptev Sea, Northwest Passage, and other tributary water bodies

Area - comparative:
  slightly less than 1.5 times the size of the US

Coastline:
  45,389 km

Climate:
  polar climate characterized by persistent cold and relatively
  narrow annual temperature ranges; winters characterized by
  continuous darkness, cold and stable weather conditions, and clear
  skies; summers characterized by continuous daylight, damp and foggy
  weather, and weak cyclones with rain or snow

Terrain:
  central surface covered by a perennial drifting polar icepack that,
  on average, is about 3 meters thick, although pressure ridges may be
  three times that thickness; clockwise drift pattern in the Beaufort
  Gyral Stream, but nearly straight-line movement from the New
  Siberian Islands (Russia) to Denmark Strait (between Greenland and
  Iceland); the icepack is surrounded by open seas during the summer,
  but more than doubles in size during the winter and extends to the
  encircling landmasses; the ocean floor is about 50% continental
  shelf (highest percentage of any ocean) with the remainder a central
  basin interrupted by three submarine ridges (Alpha Cordillera,
  Nansen Cordillera, and Lomonosov Ridge)

Elevation extremes:
  lowest point: Fram Basin -4,665 m
  highest point: sea level 0 m

Natural resources:
  sand and gravel aggregates, placer deposits, polymetallic nodules,
  oil and gas fields, fish, marine mammals (seals and whales)

Natural hazards:
  ice islands occasionally break away from northern Ellesmere Island;
  icebergs calved from glaciers in western Greenland and extreme

Introduction Argentina


Background:
  In 1816, the United Provinces of the Rio Plata declared their
  independence from Spain. Eventually, Bolivia, Paraguay, and Uruguay
  went their own way, but the area that remained became Argentina. The
  country's population and culture were subsequently heavily shaped by
  immigrants from throughout Europe, but most particularly Italy and
  Spain, which provided the largest percentage of newcomers from 1860
  to 1930. Up until about the mid-20th century, much of Argentina's
  history was dominated by periods of internal political conflict
  between Federalists and Unitarians and between civilian and military
  factions. After World War II, an era of Peronist authoritarian rule
  and interference in subsequent governments was followed by a
  military junta that took power in 1976. Democracy returned in 1983,
  and has persisted despite numerous challenges, the most formidable
  of which was a severe economic crisis in 2001-02 that led to violent
  public protests and the resignation of several interim presidents.
  The economy has since recovered strongly since bottoming out in
  2002. The government renegotiated its public debt in 2005 and paid
  off its remaining obligations to the IMF in early 2006.

Economy Argentina


Economy - overview:
  Argentina benefits from rich natural resources, a highly literate
  population, an export-oriented agricultural sector, and a
  diversified industrial base. Although one of the world's wealthiest
  countries 100 years ago, Argentina suffered during most of the
  twentieth century from recurring economic crises, persistent fiscal
  and current account deficits, high inflation, mounting external
  debt, and capital flight. Beginning in 1998, with external debt
  equivalent to more than 400 percent of annual exports, economic
  growth slowed and ultimately fell into a full-blown depression, as
  investors' fears grew in the wake of Russia's debt default,
  political discord caused by then-President Carlos MENEM's unpopular
  efforts to run for a constitutionally prohibited third term, and
  Brazil's devaluation. The government of Fernando DE LA RUA, elected
  President in late 1999, tried several measures to cut the fiscal
  deficit and instill confidence and received large IMF credit
  facilities, but nothing worked to revive the economy. Depositors
  began withdrawing money from the banks in late 2001, and the
  government responded with strict limits on withdrawals. When street
  protests turned deadly, DE LA RUA was forced to resign in December
  2001. Interim President Adolfo Rodriguez SAA declared a default, the
  largest in history, on Argentina's foreign debt, but he stepped down
  only a few days later when he failed to garner political support
  from the country's governors. Eduardo DUHALDE became President in
  January 2002 and announced an end to the peso's decade-long 1-to-1
  peg to the US dollar. When the peso depreciated and inflation rose,
  DUHALDE's government froze utility tariffs indefinitely, curtailed
  creditors' rights, and imposed high taxes on exports. The economy
  rebounded strongly from the crisis, inflation started falling, and
  DUHALDE called for special elections. Nestor KIRCHNER was elected
  President, taking office in May 2003, and continued the restrictions
  imposed by DUHALDE. With the reemergence of double-digit inflation
  in 2005, the KIRCHNER administration pressured businesses into a
  series of agreements to hold down prices. The government also
  restructured its defaulted debt in 2005, convincing most bondholders
  to accept a large cut on the value of their holdings, and paid off
  its IMF obligations from reserves in full in early 2006, both of
  which have reduced Argentina's external debt burden. Real GDP has
  continued growing strongly, averaging 9 percent during the period
  2003-2006, bolstering government revenues and keeping the fiscal
  accounts-a key vulnerability in the past-in surplus.

  general assessment: by opening the telecommunications market to
  competition and foreign investment with the "Telecommunications
  Liberalization Plan of 1998," Argentina encouraged the growth of
  modern telecommunications technology; fiber-optic cable trunk lines
  are being installed between all major cities; the major networks are
  entirely digital and the availability of telephone service is
  improving; however, telephone density is presently minimal, and
  making telephone service universally available will take time
  domestic: microwave radio relay, fiber-optic cable, and a domestic
  satellite system with 40 earth stations serve the trunk network;
  more than 110,000 pay telephones are installed and mobile telephone
  use is rapidly expanding

  responsive (2005)

Transnational Issues Argentina


Disputes - international:
  Argentina continues to assert its claims to the UK-administered
  Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas) and South Georgia and the South
  Sandwich Islands in its constitution, forcibly occupying the
  Falklands in 1982, but in 1995 agreed no longer to seek settlement
  by force; territorial claim in Antarctica partially overlaps UK and
  Chilean claims (see Antarctic disputes); unruly region at
  convergence of Argentina-Brazil-Paraguay borders is locus of money
  laundering, smuggling, arms and illegal narcotics trafficking, and
  fundraising for extremist organizations; uncontested dispute between
  Brazil and Uruguay over Braziliera Island in the Quarai/Cuareim
  River leaves the tripoint with Argentina in question; action by the
  joint boundary commission, established by Chile and Argentina in
  2001, for mapping and demarcating the disputed boundary in the
  Andean Southern Ice Field (Campo de Hielo Sur) remains pending

Trafficking in persons:
  current situation: Argentina is primarily a destination country for
  women and children trafficked for sexual and labor exploitation with
  most victims trafficked internally, from rural to urban areas, for
  exploitation in prostitution; foreign women and children trafficked
  for commercial sexual exploitation come primarily from Paraguay, but
  also from Bolivia, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Colombia, and
  Chile; Bolivians are trafficked for forced labor; Argentine women
  and girls are also trafficked to neighboring countries for sexual
  exploitation
  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Argentina failed to show evidence
  of increasing efforts to combat trafficking particularly in the key
  area of prosecutions; government efforts to improve interagency
  anti-trafficking coordination did not achieve significant progress
  in moving cases against traffickers through the judicial system; the
  government made progress in other areas, by submitting
  anti-trafficking legislation to Congress in August 2005 and
  sensitizing provincial and municipal government officials to the
  trafficking problem

Illicit drugs:
  used as a transshipment country for cocaine headed for Europe; some
  money-laundering activity, especially in the Tri-Border Area;
  domestic consumption of drugs in urban centers is increasing

Introduction Armenia


Background:
  Armenia prides itself on being the first nation to formally adopt
  Christianity (early 4th century). Despite periods of autonomy, over
  the centuries Armenia came under the sway of various empires
  including the Roman, Byzantine, Arab, Persian, and Ottoman. During
  World War I in the western portion of Armenia, Ottoman Turkey
  instituted a policy of forced resettlement coupled with other harsh
  practices that resulted in an estimated 1 million Armenian deaths.
  The eastern area of Armenia was ceded by the Ottomans to Russia in
  1828; this portion declared its independence in 1918, but was
  conquered by the Soviet Red Army in 1920. Armenian leaders remain
  preoccupied by the long conflict with Muslim Azerbaijan over
  Nagorno-Karabakh, a primarily Armenian-populated region, assigned to
  Soviet Azerbaijan in the 1920s by Moscow. Armenia and Azerbaijan
  began fighting over the area in 1988; the struggle escalated after
  both countries attained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.
  By May 1994, when a cease-fire took hold, Armenian forces held not
  only Nagorno-Karabakh but also a significant portion of Azerbaijan
  proper. The economies of both sides have been hurt by their
  inability to make substantial progress toward a peaceful resolution.
  Turkey imposed an economic blockade on Armenia and closed the common
  border because of the Armenian occupation of Nagorno-Karabakh and
  surrounding areas.

Economy Armenia


Economy - overview:
  Under the old Soviet central planning system, Armenia had developed
  a modern industrial sector, supplying machine tools, textiles, and
  other manufactured goods to sister republics in exchange for raw
  materials and energy. Since the implosion of the USSR in December
  1991, Armenia has switched to small-scale agriculture away from the
  large agroindustrial complexes of the Soviet era. The agricultural
  sector has long-term needs for more investment and updated
  technology. The privatization of industry has been at a slower pace,
  but has been given renewed emphasis by the current administration.
  Armenia is a food importer, and its mineral deposits (copper, gold,
  bauxite) are small. The ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan over the
  ethnic Armenian-dominated region of Nagorno-Karabakh and the breakup
  of the centrally directed economic system of the former Soviet Union
  contributed to a severe economic decline in the early 1990s. By
  1994, however, the Armenian Government had launched an ambitious
  IMF-sponsored economic liberalization program that resulted in
  positive growth rates in 1995-2006. Armenia joined the WTO in
  January 2003. Armenia also has managed to slash inflation, stabilize
  its currency, and privatize most small- and medium-sized
  enterprises. Armenia's unemployment rate, however, remains high,
  despite strong economic growth. The chronic energy shortages Armenia
  suffered in the early and mid-1990s have been offset by the energy
  supplied by one of its nuclear power plants at Metsamor. Armenia is
  now a net energy exporter, although it does not have sufficient
  generating capacity to replace Metsamor, which is under
  international pressure to close. The electricity distribution system
  was privatized in 2002 and bought by Russia's RAO-UES in 2005.
  Armenia's severe trade imbalance has been offset somewhat by
  international aid, remittances from Armenians working abroad, and
  foreign direct investment. Economic ties with Russia remain close,
  especially in the energy sector. The government made some
  improvements in tax and customs administration in 2005, but
  anti-corruption measures will be more difficult to implement.
  Construction of a natural gas pipeline between Iran and Armenia has
  been completed and it is scheduled to be commissioned by April 2007.
  Investment in the construction and industrial sectors is expected to
  continue in 2007 and will help to ensure annual average real GDP
  growth of more than 10%.

Transnational Issues Armenia


Disputes - international:
  Armenia supports ethnic Armenian secessionists in Nagorno-Karabakh
  and since the early 1990s, has militarily occupied 16% of Azerbaijan
  - Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
  continues to mediate dispute; over 800,000 mostly ethnic
  Azerbaijanis were driven from the occupied lands and Armenia; about
  230,000 ethnic Armenians were driven from their homes in Azerbaijan
  into Armenia; Azerbaijan seeks transit route through Armenia to
  connect to Naxcivan exclave; border with Turkey remains closed over
  Nagorno-Karabakh dispute; ethnic Armenian groups in Javakheti region
  of Georgia seek greater autonomy; tens of thousands of Armenians
  emigrate, primarily to Russia, to seek employment

Refugees and internally displaced persons:
  refugees (country of origin): 219,324 (Azerbaijan)
  IDPs: 8,400 (conflict with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh,
  majority have returned home since 1994 ceasefire) (2006)

Trafficking in persons:
  current situation: Armenia is a major source and, to a lesser
  extent, a transit and destination country for women and girls
  trafficked for sexual exploitation largely to the UAE and Turkey;
  traffickers, many of them women, route victims directly into Dubai
  or through Moscow; profits derived from the trafficking of Armenian
  victims reportedly increased dramatically from 2005
  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Armenia has failed to show evidence
  of increasing efforts, particularly in the areas of enforcement,
  trafficking-related corruption, and victim protection; the
  government increased implementation of its anti-trafficking law, but
  failed to impose significant penalties for convicted traffickers and
  failed to vigorously investigate and prosecute ongoing and
  widespread allegations of public officials' complicity in
  trafficking; victim protection efforts remain in early, formative
  stages and a lack of sensitivity for victims remains a problem,
  particularly in the judiciary

Illicit drugs:
  illicit cultivation of small amount of cannabis for domestic
  consumption; minor transit point for illicit drugs - mostly opium
  and hashish - moving from Southwest Asia to Russia and to a lesser
  extent the rest of Europe

@Aruba

Introduction Aruba


Background:
  Discovered and claimed for Spain in 1499, Aruba was acquired by the
  Dutch in 1636. The island's economy has been dominated by three main
  industries. A 19th century gold rush was followed by prosperity
  brought on by the opening in 1924 of an oil refinery. The last
  decades of the 20th century saw a boom in the tourism industry.
  Aruba seceded from the Netherlands Antilles in 1986 and became a
  separate, autonomous member of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.
  Movement toward full independence was halted at Aruba's request in
  1990.

Economy Aruba


Economy - overview:
  Tourism is the mainstay of the small, open Aruban economy, with
  offshore banking and oil refining and storage also important. The
  rapid growth of the tourism sector over the last decade has resulted
  in a substantial expansion of other activities. Over 1.5 million
  tourists per year visit Aruba, with 75% of those from the US.
  Construction continues to boom, with hotel capacity five times the
  1985 level. In addition, the reopening of the country's oil refinery
  in 1993, a major source of employment and foreign exchange earnings,
  has further spurred growth. Tourist arrivals have rebounded strongly
  following a dip after the 11 September 2001 attacks. The island
  experiences only a brief low season, and hotel occupancy in 2004
  averaged 80%, compared to 68% throughout the rest of the Caribbean.
  The government has made cutting the budget and trade deficits a high
  priority.

@Atlantic Ocean



Background:
  The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's five oceans
  (after the Pacific Ocean, but larger than the Indian Ocean, Southern
  Ocean, and Arctic Ocean). The Kiel Canal (Germany), Oresund
  (Denmark-Sweden), Bosporus (Turkey), Strait of Gibraltar
  (Morocco-Spain), and the Saint Lawrence Seaway (Canada-US) are
  important strategic access waterways. The decision by the
  International Hydrographic Organization in the spring of 2000 to
  delimit a fifth world ocean, the Southern Ocean, removed the portion
  of the Atlantic Ocean south of 60 degrees south latitude.

Geography Atlantic Ocean


Location:
  body of water between Africa, Europe, the Southern Ocean, and the
  Western Hemisphere

Geographic coordinates:
  0 00 N, 25 00 W

Map references:

Area:
  total: 76.762 million sq km
  note: includes Baltic Sea, Black Sea, Caribbean Sea, Davis Strait,
  Denmark Strait, part of the Drake Passage, Gulf of Mexico, Labrador
  Sea, Mediterranean Sea, North Sea, Norwegian Sea, almost all of the
  Scotia Sea, and other tributary water bodies

Area - comparative:
  slightly less than 6.5 times the size of the US

Coastline:
  111,866 km

Climate:
  tropical cyclones (hurricanes) develop off the coast of Africa near
  Cape Verde and move westward into the Caribbean Sea; hurricanes can
  occur from May to December, but are most frequent from August to
  November

Terrain:
  surface usually covered with sea ice in Labrador Sea, Denmark
  Strait, and coastal portions of the Baltic Sea from October to June;
  clockwise warm-water gyre (broad, circular system of currents) in
  the northern Atlantic, counterclockwise warm-water gyre in the
  southern Atlantic; the ocean floor is dominated by the Mid-Atlantic
  Ridge, a rugged north-south centerline for the entire Atlantic basin

Elevation extremes:
  lowest point: Milwaukee Deep in the Puerto Rico Trench -8,605 m
  highest point: sea level 0 m

Natural resources:
  oil and gas fields, fish, marine mammals (seals and whales), sand
  and gravel aggregates, placer deposits, polymetallic nodules,
  precious stones

Natural hazards:
  icebergs common in Davis Strait, Denmark Strait, and the
  northwestern Atlantic Ocean from February to August and have been
  spotted as far south as Bermuda and the Madeira Islands; ships
  subject to superstructure icing in extreme northern Atlantic from
  October to May; persistent fog can be a maritime hazard from May to
  September; hurricanes (May to December)

Environment - current issues:
  endangered marine species include the manatee, seals, sea lions,
  turtles, and whales; drift net fishing is hastening the decline of
  fish stocks and contributing to international disputes; municipal
  sludge pollution off eastern US, southern Brazil, and eastern
  Argentina; oil pollution in Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, Lake
  Maracaibo, Mediterranean Sea, and North Sea; industrial waste and
  municipal sewage pollution in Baltic Sea, North Sea, and
  Mediterranean Sea

Geography - note:
  major chokepoints include the Dardanelles, Strait of Gibraltar,
  access to the Panama and Suez Canals; strategic straits include the
  Strait of Dover, Straits of Florida, Mona Passage, The Sound
  (Oresund), and Windward Passage; the Equator divides the Atlantic
  Ocean into the North Atlantic Ocean and South Atlantic Ocean



Economy Atlantic Ocean


Economy - overview:
  The Atlantic Ocean provides some of the world's most heavily
  trafficked sea routes, between and within the Eastern and Western
  Hemispheres. Other economic activity includes the exploitation of
  natural resources, e.g., fishing, dredging of aragonite sands (The
  Bahamas), and production of crude oil and natural gas (Caribbean
  Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and North Sea).

@Australia

Introduction Australia


Background:
  Aboriginal settlers arrived on the continent from Southeast Asia
  about 40,000 years before the first Europeans began exploration in
  the 17th century. No formal territorial claims were made until 1770,
  when Capt. James COOK took possession in the name of Great Britain.
  Six colonies were created in the late 18th and 19th centuries; they
  federated and became the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901. The new
  country took advantage of its natural resources to rapidly develop
  agricultural and manufacturing industries and to make a major
  contribution to the British effort in World Wars I and II. In recent
  decades, Australia has transformed itself into an internationally
  competitive, advanced market economy. It boasted one of the OECD's
  fastest growing economies during the 1990s, a performance due in
  large part to economic reforms adopted in the 1980s. Long-term
  concerns include pollution, particularly depletion of the ozone
  layer, and management and conservation of coastal areas, especially
  the Great Barrier Reef.

Economy Australia


Economy - overview:
  Australia has an enviable Western-style capitalist economy with a
  per capita GDP on par with the four dominant West European
  economies. Rising output in the domestic economy, robust business
  and consumer confidence, and high export prices for raw materials
  and agricultural products are fueling the economy. Australia's
  emphasis on reforms, low inflation, and growing ties with China are
  other key factors behind the economy's strength. The impact of
  drought and strong import demand pushed the trade deficit up in
  recent years, although the trade balance improved in 2006. Housing
  prices probably peaked in 2005, diminishing the prospect that
  interest rates would be raised to prevent a speculative bubble.
  Conservative fiscal policies have kept Australia's budget in surplus
  since 2002.

Introduction Austria


Background:
  Once the center of power for the large Austro-Hungarian Empire,
  Austria was reduced to a small republic after its defeat in World
  War I. Following annexation by Nazi Germany in 1938 and subsequent
  occupation by the victorious Allies in 1945, Austria's status
  remained unclear for a decade. A State Treaty signed in 1955 ended
  the occupation, recognized Austria's independence, and forbade
  unification with Germany. A constitutional law that same year
  declared the country's "perpetual neutrality" as a condition for
  Soviet military withdrawal. The Soviet Union's collapse in 1991 and
  Austria's entry into the European Union in 1995 have altered the
  meaning of this neutrality. A prosperous, democratic country,
  Austria entered the EU Economic Monetary Union in 1999.

Economy Austria


Economy - overview:
  Austria, with its well-developed market economy and high standard
  of living, is closely tied to other EU economies, especially
  Germany's. The Austrian economy also benefits greatly from strong
  commercial relations, especially in the banking and insurance
  sectors, with central, eastern, and southeastern Europe. The economy
  features a large service sector, a sound industrial sector, and a
  small, but highly developed agricultural sector. Membership in the
  EU has drawn an influx of foreign investors attracted by Austria's
  access to the single European market and proximity to the new EU
  economies. The outgoing government has successfully pursued a
  comprehensive economic reform program, aimed at streamlining
  government, creating a more competitive business environment,
  further strengthening Austria's attractiveness as an investment
  location, and implementing effective pension reforms; however, lower
  taxes in 2005-2006 have lead to a small budget deficit in 2006. Weak
  domestic consumption and slow growth in Europe have held the economy
  to growth rates below 3% in 2002-05. Due to higher growth across
  Europe, Austrian grew 3.3 percent in 2006. To meet increased
  competition from both EU and Central European countries,
  particularly the new EU members, Austria will need to continue
  restructuring, emphasizing knowledge-based sectors of the economy,
  and encouraging greater labor flexibility and greater labor
  participation by its aging population.

@Azerbaijan

Introduction Azerbaijan


Background:
  Azerbaijan - a nation with a Turkic and majority-Muslim population
  - was briefly independent from 1918 to 1920; it regained its
  independence after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Despite
  a 1994 cease-fire, Azerbaijan has yet to resolve its conflict with
  Armenia over the Azerbaijani Nagorno-Karabakh enclave (largely
  Armenian populated). Azerbaijan has lost 16% of its territory and
  must support some 528,000 internally displaced persons as a result
  of the conflict. Corruption is ubiquitous, and the promise of
  widespread wealth from Azerbaijan's undeveloped petroleum resources
  remains largely unfulfilled.

Geography Azerbaijan


Location:
  Southwestern Asia, bordering the Caspian Sea, between Iran and
  Russia, with a small European portion north of the Caucasus range

Geographic coordinates:
  40 30 N, 47 30 E

Map references:
  Asia

Area:
  total: 86,600 sq km
  land: 86,100 sq km
  water: 500 sq km
  note: includes the exclave of Naxcivan Autonomous Republic and the
  Nagorno-Karabakh region; the region's autonomy was abolished by
  Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet on 26 November 1991

Area - comparative:
  slightly smaller than Maine

Land boundaries:
  total: 2,013 km
  border countries: Armenia (with Azerbaijan-proper) 566 km, Armenia
  (with Azerbaijan-Naxcivan exclave) 221 km, Georgia 322 km, Iran
  (with Azerbaijan-proper) 432 km, Iran (with Azerbaijan-Naxcivan
  exclave) 179 km, Russia 284 km, Turkey 9 km

Coastline:
  0 km (landlocked); note - Azerbaijan borders the Caspian Sea (800
  km est.)

Maritime claims:
  none (landlocked)

Climate:
  dry, semiarid steppe

Terrain:
  large, flat Kur-Araz Ovaligi (Kura-Araks Lowland) (much of it below
  sea level) with Great Caucasus Mountains to the north, Qarabag
  Yaylasi (Karabakh Upland) in west; Baku lies on Abseron Yasaqligi
  (Apsheron Peninsula) that juts into Caspian Sea

Environment - current issues:
  local scientists consider the Abseron Yasaqligi (Apsheron
  Peninsula) (including Baku and Sumqayit) and the Caspian Sea to be
  the ecologically most devastated area in the world because of severe
  air, soil, and water pollution; soil pollution results from oil
  spills, from the use of DDT as a pesticide, and from toxic
  defoliants used in the production of cotton

Environment - international agreements:
  party to: Air Pollution, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate
  Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species,
  Hazardous Wastes, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Wetlands

Economy Azerbaijan


Economy - overview:
  Azerbaijan's number one export is oil. Azerbaijan's oil production
  declined through 1997, but has registered an increase every year
  since. Negotiation of production-sharing arrangements (PSAs) with
  foreign firms, which have thus far committed $60 billion to
  long-term oilfield development, should generate the funds needed to
  spur future industrial development. Oil production under the first
  of these PSAs, with the Azerbaijan International Operating Company,
  began in November 1997. A consortium of Western oil companies began
  pumping 1 million barrels a day from a large offshore field in early
  2006, through a $4 billion pipeline it built from Baku to Turkey's
  Mediterranean port of Ceyhan. Economists estimate that by 2010
  revenues from this project will double the country's current GDP.
  Azerbaijan shares all the formidable problems of the former Soviet
  republics in making the transition from a command to a market
  economy, but its considerable energy resources brighten its
  long-term prospects. Baku has only recently begun making progress on
  economic reform, and old economic ties and structures are slowly
  being replaced. Several other obstacles impede Azerbaijan's economic
  progress: the need for stepped up foreign investment in the
  non-energy sector, the continuing conflict with Armenia over the
  Nagorno-Karabakh region, and the pervasive corruption. Trade with
  Russia and the other former Soviet republics is declining in
  importance while trade is building with Turkey and the nations of
  Europe. Long-term prospects will depend on world oil prices, the
  location of new pipelines in the region, and Azerbaijan's ability to
  manage its oil wealth.

Introduction Bahamas, The


Background:
  Lucayan Indians inhabited the islands when Christopher Columbus
  first set foot in the New World on San Salvador in 1492. British
  settlement of the islands began in 1647; the islands became a colony
  in 1783. Since attaining independence from the UK in 1973, The
  Bahamas have prospered through tourism and international banking and
  investment management. Because of its geography, the country is a
  major transshipment point for illegal drugs, particularly shipments
  to the US, and its territory is used for smuggling illegal migrants
  into the US.

Economy Bahamas, The


Economy - overview:
  The Bahamas is a stable, developing nation with an economy heavily
  dependent on tourism and offshore banking. Tourism together with
  tourism-driven construction and manufacturing accounts for
  approximately 60% of GDP and directly or indirectly employs half of
  the archipelago's labor force. Steady growth in tourism receipts and
  a boom in construction of new hotels, resorts, and residences had
  led to solid GDP growth in recent years, but the slowdown in the US
  economy and the attacks of 11 September 2001 held back growth in
  these sectors in 2001-03. The current government has presided over a
  period of economic recovery and an upturn in large-scale private
  sector investments in tourism. Financial services constitute the
  second-most important sector of the Bahamian economy, accounting for
  about 15% of GDP. However, since December 2000, when the government
  enacted new regulations on the financial sector, many international
  businesses have left The Bahamas. Manufacturing and agriculture
  together contribute approximately a tenth of GDP and show little
  growth, despite government incentives aimed at those sectors.
  Overall growth prospects in the short run rest heavily on the
  fortunes of the tourism sector, which depends on growth in the US,
  the source of more than 80% of the visitors.

@Bahrain

Introduction Bahrain


Background:
  In 1782, the Al Khalifa family captured Bahrain from the Persians.
  In order to secure these holdings, it entered into a series of
  treaties with the UK during the 19th century that made Bahrain a
  British protectorate. The archipelago attained its independence in
  1971. Bahrain's small size and central location among Persian Gulf
  countries require it to play a delicate balancing act in foreign
  affairs among its larger neighbors. Facing declining oil reserves,
  Bahrain has turned to petroleum processing and refining and has
  transformed itself into an international banking center. King HAMAD
  bin Isa Al Khalifa, after coming to power in 1999, pushed economic
  and political reforms to improve relations with the Shia community
  and Shia political societies participated in 2006 parliamentary and
  municipal elections. Al Wifaq, the largest Shia political society,
  won the largest number of seats in the elected chamber of the
  legislature. However, Shia discontent has resurfaced in recent years
  with street demonstrations and occasional low-level violence.

Economy Bahrain


Economy - overview:
  With its highly developed communication and transport facilities,
  Bahrain is home to numerous multinational firms with business in the
  Gulf. Petroleum production and refining account for about 60% of
  Bahrain's export receipts, 70% of government revenues, and 20% of
  GDP, underpinning Bahrain's strong economic growth in recent years.
  The financial and construction sectors have also bolstered GDP
  growth. Bahrain is actively pursuing the diversification and
  privatization of its economy to reduce the country's dependence on
  oil. As part of this effort, Bahrain and the US in August 2006
  implemented a Free Trade Agreement (FTA), the first FTA between the
  US and a Gulf state. Unemployment, especially among the young, and
  the depletion of oil and underground water resources are major
  long-term economic problems.

Trafficking in persons:

  involuntary servitude when faced with exorbitant recruitment and
  transportation fees, withholding of their passports, restrictions on
  their movement, non-payment of wages, and physical or sexual abuse;
  Eastern European women are also believed to be trafficked to Bahrain
  for the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation or forced labor
  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Bahrain's efforts to address
  trafficking in persons are based largely on pledges of future
  efforts; the government did not enact a comprehensive
  anti-trafficking law extending labor protection to domestic workers

Introduction Bangladesh


Background:
  Europeans began to set up trading posts in the area of Bangladesh
  in the 16th century; eventually the British came to dominate the
  region and it became part of British India. In 1947, West Pakistan
  and East Bengal (both primarily Muslim) separated from India
  (largely Hindu) and jointly became the new country of Pakistan. East
  Bengal became East Pakistan in 1955, but the awkward arrangement of
  a two-part country with its territorial units separated by 1,600 km
  left the Bengalis marginalized and dissatisfied. East Pakistan
  seceded from its union with West Pakistan in 1971 and was renamed
  Bangladesh. About a third of this extremely poor country floods
  annually during the monsoon rainy season, hampering economic
  development.

Economy Bangladesh


Economy - overview:
  Despite sustained domestic and international efforts to improve
  economic and demographic prospects, Bangladesh remains a poor,
  overpopulated, and inefficiently-governed nation. Although more than
  half of GDP is generated through the service sector, nearly
  two-thirds of Bangladeshis are employed in the agriculture sector,
  with rice as the single-most-important product. Major impediments to
  growth include frequent cyclones and floods, inefficient state-owned
  enterprises, inadequate port facilities, a rapidly growing labor
  force that cannot be absorbed by agriculture, delays in exploiting
  energy resources (natural gas), insufficient power supplies, and
  slow implementation of economic reforms. Reform is stalled in many
  instances by political infighting and corruption at all levels of
  government. Progress also has been blocked by opposition from the
  bureaucracy, public sector unions, and other vested interest groups.
  The BNP government, led by Prime Minister Khaleda ZIA, has the
  parliamentary strength to push through needed reforms, but the
  party's political will to do so has been lacking in key areas. On an
  encouraging note, growth has been a steady 5-6% for the past several
  years.

Introduction Barbados


Background:
  The island was uninhabited when first settled by the British in
  1627. Slaves worked the sugar plantations established on the island
  until 1834 when slavery was abolished. The economy remained heavily
  dependent on sugar, rum, and molasses production through most of the
  20th century. The gradual introduction of social and political
  reforms in the 1940s and 1950s led to complete independence from the
  UK in 1966. In the 1990s, tourism and manufacturing surpassed the
  sugar industry in economic importance.

Economy Barbados


Economy - overview:

  encourage direct foreign investment, and to privatize remaining
  state-owned enterprises. The economy contracted in 2002-03 mainly
  due to a decline in tourism. Growth was positive in 2005-06, as
  economic conditions in the US and Europe moderately improved.

Introduction Belarus


Background:
  After seven decades as a constituent republic of the USSR, Belarus
  attained its independence in 1991. It has retained closer political
  and economic ties to Russia than any of the other former Soviet
  republics. Belarus and Russia signed a treaty on a two-state union
  on 8 December 1999 envisioning greater political and economic
  integration. Although Belarus agreed to a framework to carry out the
  accord, serious implementation has yet to take place. Since his
  election in July 1994 as the country's first president, Alexandr
  LUKASHENKO has steadily consolidated his power through authoritarian
  means. Government restrictions on freedom of speech and the press,
  peaceful assembly, and religion continue.

Economy Belarus


Economy - overview:
  Belarus's economy in 2006 posted more than 8% growth. The
  government has succeeded in lowering inflation over the past several
  years. Trade with Russia - by far its largest single trade partner -
  decreased in 2006, largely as a result of a change in the way the
  Value Added Tax (VAT) on trade was collected. Trade with European
  countries increased. Belarus has seen little structural reform since
  1995, when President LUKASHENKO launched the country on the path of
  "market socialism." In keeping with this policy, LUKASHENKO
  reimposed administrative controls over prices and currency exchange
  rates and expanded the state's right to intervene in the management
  of private enterprises. Since 2005, the government has
  re-nationalized a number of private companies. In addition,
  businesses have been subject to pressure by central and local
  governments, e.g., arbitrary changes in regulations, numerous
  rigorous inspections, retroactive application of new business
  regulations, and arrests of "disruptive" businessmen and factory
  owners. A wide range of redistributive policies has helped those at
  the bottom of the ladder; the Gini coefficient is among the lowest
  in the world. Because of these restrictive economic policies,
  Belarus has had trouble attracting foreign investment, which remains
  low. Growth has been strong in recent years, despite the roadblocks
  in a tough, centrally directed economy with a high, but decreasing,
  rate of inflation. Belarus receives heavily discounted oil and
  natural gas from Russia and much of Belarus' growth can be
  attributed to the re-export of Russian oil at market prices. This
  growth will be threatened in 2007, however, when Russia raises
  energy prices closer to world market prices for Belarus. Russia is
  planning to increase Belarusian gas prices from $47 per thousand
  cubic meters (tcm) to $200 per tcm and introduce a first-time export
  duty of $180 per ton on oil shipped to Belarus.

Introduction Belgium


Background:
  Belgium became independent from the Netherlands in 1830; it was
  occupied by Germany during World Wars I and II. The country
  prospered in the past half century as a modern, technologically
  advanced European state and member of NATO and the EU. Tensions
  between the Dutch-speaking Flemings of the north and the
  French-speaking Walloons of the south have led in recent years to
  constitutional amendments granting these regions formal recognition
  and autonomy.

Economy Belgium


Economy - overview:
  This modern, private-enterprise economy has capitalized on its
  central geographic location, highly developed transport network, and
  diversified industrial and commercial base. Industry is concentrated
  mainly in the populous Flemish area in the north. With few natural
  resources, Belgium must import substantial quantities of raw
  materials and export a large volume of manufactures, making its
  economy unusually dependent on the state of world markets. Roughly
  three-quarters of its trade is with other EU countries. Public debt
  is more than 90% of GDP. On the positive side, the government has
  succeeded in balancing its budget, and income distribution is
  relatively equal. Belgium began circulating the euro currency in
  January 2002. Economic growth in 2001-03 dropped sharply because of
  the global economic slowdown, with moderate recovery in 2004-06.

Introduction Belize


Background:
  Belize was the site of several Mayan city states until their
  decline at the end of the first millennium A.D. The British and
  Spanish disputed the region in the 17th and 18th centuries; it
  formally became the colony of British Honduras in 1854. Territorial
  disputes between the UK and Guatemala delayed the independence of
  Belize until 1981. Guatemala refused to recognize the new nation
  until 1992. Tourism has become the mainstay of the economy. Current
  concerns include high unemployment, growing involvement in the South
  American drug trade, and increasing urban crime.

Economy Belize


Economy - overview:
  In this small, essentially private-enterprise economy the tourism
  industry is the number one foreign exchange earner followed by
  marine products, citrus, cane sugar, bananas, and garments. The
  government's expansionary monetary and fiscal policies, initiated in
  September 1998, led to sturdy GDP growth averaging nearly 4% in
  1999-2006. Major concerns continue to be the sizable trade deficit
  and unsustainable foreign debt. The government in 2006 announced it
  would seek a restructuring of its sovereign debt and has been
  negotiating with international creditors to find an acceptable
  formula for doing so. A key short-term objective remains the
  reduction of poverty with the help of international donors.

  country for men, women, and children trafficked for the purposes of
  labor and sexual exploitation; women and girls are trafficked mainly
  from Central America, and exploited in prostitution; children are
  trafficked to Belize for labor exploitation; Belize's largely
  unmonitored borders with Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico facilitate
  the movement of illegal migrants who are vulnerable to traffickers;
  girls are trafficked within the country for sexual exploitation,
  sometimes with the consent and complicity of their close relatives;
  there are unconfirmed reports that Indian and Chinese migrants are
  trafficked for involuntary servitude in homes and shops
  tier rating: Tier 3 - Belize has failed to show evidence of
  significant law enforcement or victim protection efforts

Illicit drugs:
  transshipment point for cocaine; small-scale illicit producer of
  cannabis for the international drug trade; money-laundering activity

Introduction Benin


Background:
  Present day Benin was the site of Dahomey, a prominent West African
  kingdom that rose in the 15th century. The territory became a French
  Colony in 1872 and achieved independence on 1 August 1960, as the
  Republic of Benin. A succession of military governments ended in
  1972 with the rise to power of Mathieu KEREKOU and the establishment
  of a government based on Marxist-Leninist principles. A move to
  representative government began in 1989. Two years later, free
  elections ushered in former Prime Minister Nicephore SOGLO as
  president, marking the first successful transfer of power in Africa
  from a dictatorship to a democracy. KEREKOU was returned to power by
  elections held in 1996 and 2001, though some irregularities were
  alleged. KEREKOU stepped down at the end of his second term in 2006
  and was succeeded by Thomas YAYI BONI, a political outsider and
  independent.

Economy Benin


Economy - overview:
  The economy of Benin remains underdeveloped and dependent on
  subsistence agriculture, cotton production, and regional trade.
  Growth in real output has averaged around 5% in the past six years,
  but rapid population growth has offset much of this increase.
  Inflation has subsided over the past several years. In order to
  raise growth still further, Benin plans to attract more foreign
  investment, place more emphasis on tourism, facilitate the
  development of new food processing systems and agricultural
  products, and encourage new information and communication
  technology. Many of these proposals were included in Benin's $307
  million Millennium Challenge Account grant signed in February 2006.
  The 2001 privatization policy continues in telecommunications,
  water, electricity, and agriculture in spite of government
  reluctance. The Paris Club and bilateral creditors have eased the
  external debt situation, with Benin benefiting from a G8 debt
  reduction announced in July 2005, while pressing for more rapid
  structural reforms. Benin continues to be hurt by Nigerian trade
  protection that bans imports of a growing list of products from
  Benin and elsewhere, which has resulted in increased smuggling and
  criminality in the border region.

  highly successful offshore financial center. Although a referendum
  on independence from the UK was soundly defeated in 1995, the
  present government has reopened debate on the issue.

Economy Bermuda


Economy - overview:
  Bermuda enjoys the highest per capita income in the world, more
  than 50% higher than that of the US. Its economy is primarily based
  on providing financial services for international business and
  luxury facilities for tourists. A number of reinsurance companies
  relocated to the island following 11 September 2001 and again after
  Hurricane Katrina, contributing to the expansion of an already
  robust international business sector. Bermuda's tourism industry -
  which derives over 80% of its visitors from the US - continues to
  struggle but remains the island's number two industry. Most capital
  equipment and food must be imported. Bermuda's industrial sector is
  small, although construction continues to be important; the average
  cost of a house in June 2003 had risen to $976,000. Agriculture is
  limited with only 20% of the land being arable.

Introduction Bhutan


Background:
  In 1865, Britain and Bhutan signed the Treaty of Sinchulu, under
  which Bhutan would receive an annual subsidy in exchange for ceding
  some border land to British India. Under British influence, a
  monarchy was set up in 1907; three years later, a treaty was signed
  whereby the British agreed not to interfere in Bhutanese internal
  affairs and Bhutan allowed Britain to direct its foreign affairs.
  This role was assumed by independent India after 1947. Two years
  later, a formal Indo-Bhutanese accord returned the areas of Bhutan
  annexed by the British, formalized the annual subsidies the country
  received, and defined India's responsibilities in defense and
  foreign relations. A refugee issue of some 100,000 Bhutanese in
  Nepal remains unresolved; 90% of the refugees are housed in seven
  United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
  camps. In March 2005, King Jigme Singye WANGCHUCK unveiled the
  government's draft constitution - which would introduce major
  democratic reforms - and pledged to hold a national referendum for
  its approval. A referendum date has yet to be named.

Economy Bhutan


Economy - overview:
  The economy, one of the world's smallest and least developed, is
  based on agriculture and forestry, which provide the main livelihood
  for more than 80% of the population. Agriculture consists largely of
  subsistence farming and animal husbandry. Rugged mountains dominate
  the terrain and make the building of roads and other infrastructure
  difficult and expensive. The economy is closely aligned with India's
  through strong trade and monetary links and dependence on India's
  financial assistance. The industrial sector is technologically
  backward, with most production of the cottage industry type. Most
  development projects, such as road construction, rely on Indian
  migrant labor. Bhutan's hydropower potential and its attraction for
  tourists are key resources. Model education, social, and environment
  programs are underway with support from multilateral development
  organizations. Each economic program takes into account the
  government's desire to protect the country's environment and
  cultural traditions. For example, the government, in its cautious
  expansion of the tourist sector, encourages visits by upscale,
  environmentally conscientious tourists. Detailed controls and
  uncertain policies in areas like industrial licensing, trade, labor,
  and finance continue to hamper foreign investment.

Introduction Bolivia


Background:
  Bolivia, named after independence fighter Simon BOLIVAR, broke away
  from Spanish rule in 1825; much of its subsequent history has
  consisted of a series of nearly 200 coups and countercoups.
  Democratic civilian rule was established in 1982, but leaders have
  faced difficult problems of deep-seated poverty, social unrest, and
  illegal drug production. In December 2005, Bolivians elected
  Movement Toward Socialism leader Evo MORALES president - by the
  widest margin of any leader since the restoration of civilian rule
  in 1982 - after he ran on a promise to change the country's

  the eastern lowlands.

Economy Bolivia


Economy - overview:
  Bolivia, long one of the poorest and least developed Latin American
  countries, reformed its economy after suffering a disastrous
  economic crisis in the early 1980s. The reforms spurred real GDP
  growth, which averaged 4% in the 1990s, and poverty rates fell.
  Economic growth, however, lagged again beginning in 1999 because of
  a global slowdown and homegrown factors such as political turmoil,
  civil unrest, and soaring fiscal deficits, all of which hurt
  investor confidence. In 2003, violent protests against the
  pro-foreign investment economic policies of President SANCHEZ DE
  LOZADA led to his resignation and the cancellation of plans to
  export Bolivia's newly discovered natural gas reserves to large
  northern hemisphere markets. In 2005, the government passed a
  controversial natural gas law that imposes on the oil and gas firms
  significantly higher taxes as well as new contracts that give the
  state control of their operations. Bolivian officials are in the
  process of implementing the law; meanwhile, foreign investors have
  stopped investing and have taken the first legal steps to secure
  their investments. Real GDP growth in 2003-06 - helped by increased
  demand for natural gas in neighboring Brazil - was positive, but
  still below the levels seen during the 1990s. Bolivia's fiscal
  position has improved in recent years, but the country remains
  dependent on foreign aid from multilateral lenders and foreign
  governments to meet budget shortfalls. In 2005, the G8 announced a
  $2 billion debt-forgiveness plan over the next few decades that
  should help reduce some fiscal pressures on the government in the
  near term.

  transiting Bolivia are vulnerable as trafficking victims
  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Bolivia has failed to show evidence
  of increasing efforts to combat trafficking in the areas of
  prosecutions and victim protection

Illicit drugs:
  world's third-largest cultivator of coca (after Colombia and Peru)
  with an estimated 26,500 hectares under cultivation in August 2005,
  an 8% increase from 2004; intermediate coca products and cocaine
  exported mostly to or through Brazil, Argentina, and Chile to
  European drug markets; cultivation steadily increasing despite
  eradication and alternative crop programs; money-laundering activity
  related to narcotics trade, especially along the borders with Brazil
  and Paraguay

@Bosnia and Herzegovina

Introduction Bosnia and Herzegovina


Background:
  Bosnia and Herzegovina's declaration of sovereignty in October 1991
  was followed by a declaration of independence from the former
  Yugoslavia on 3 March 1992 after a referendum boycotted by ethnic
  Serbs. The Bosnian Serbs - supported by neighboring Serbia and
  Montenegro - responded with armed resistance aimed at partitioning
  the republic along ethnic lines and joining Serb-held areas to form
  a "Greater Serbia." In March 1994, Bosniaks and Croats reduced the
  number of warring factions from three to two by signing an agreement
  creating a joint Bosniak/Croat Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
  On 21 November 1995, in Dayton, Ohio, the warring parties initialed
  a peace agreement that brought to a halt three years of interethnic
  civil strife (the final agreement was signed in Paris on 14 December
  1995). The Dayton Peace Accords retained Bosnia and Herzegovina's
  international boundaries and created a joint multi-ethnic and
  democratic government charged with conducting foreign, diplomatic,
  and fiscal policy. Also recognized was a second tier of government
  comprised of two entities roughly equal in size: the Bosniak/Croat
  Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Bosnian Serb-led
  Republika Srpska (RS). The Federation and RS governments were
  charged with overseeing most government functions. The Office of the
  High Representative (OHR) was established to oversee the
  implementation of the civilian aspects of the agreement. In 1995-96,
  a NATO-led international peacekeeping force (IFOR) of 60,000 troops
  served in Bosnia to implement and monitor the military aspects of
  the agreement. IFOR was succeeded by a smaller, NATO-led
  Stabilization Force (SFOR) whose mission was to deter renewed
  hostilities. European Union peacekeeping troops (EUFOR) replaced
  SFOR in December 2004; their mission is to maintain peace and
  stability throughout the country. EUFOR plans to phase out its
  mission beginning in 2007.

Economy Bosnia and Herzegovina


Economy - overview:
  Bosnia and Herzegovina ranked next to Macedonia as the poorest
  republic in the old Yugoslav federation. Although agriculture is
  almost all in private hands, farms are small and inefficient, and
  the republic traditionally is a net importer of food. Industry
  remains greatly overstaffed, a holdover from the socialist economic
  structure of Yugoslavia. TITO had pushed the development of military
  industries in the republic with the result that Bosnia was saddled
  with a host of industrial firms with little commercial potential.
  The interethnic warfare in Bosnia caused production to plummet by
  80% from 1992 to 1995 and unemployment to soar. With an uneasy peace
  in place, output recovered in 1996-99 at high percentage rates from
  a low base; but output growth slowed in 2000-02. Part of the lag in
  output was made up in 2003-06. National-level statistics are limited
  and do not capture the large share of black market activity. The
  konvertibilna marka (convertible mark or BAM)- the national currency
  introduced in 1998 - is pegged to the euro, and confidence in the
  currency and the banking sector has increased. Implementation of
  privatization, however, has been slow, and local entities only
  reluctantly support national-level institutions. Banking reform
  accelerated in 2001 as all the Communist-era payments bureaus were
  shut down; foreign banks, primarily from Western Europe, now control
  most of the banking sector. A sizeable current account deficit and
  high unemployment rate remain the two most serious economic
  problems. The country receives substantial amounts of reconstruction
  assistance and humanitarian aid from the international community but
  will have to prepare for an era of declining assistance.

Introduction Botswana


Background:
  Formerly the British protectorate of Bechuanaland, Botswana adopted
  its new name upon independence in 1966. Four decades of
  uninterrupted civilian leadership, progressive social policies, and
  significant capital investment have created one of the most dynamic
  economies in Africa. Mineral extraction, principally diamond mining,
  dominates economic activity, though tourism is a growing sector due
  to the country's conservation practices and extensive nature
  preserves. Botswana has one of the world's highest known rates of
  HIV/AIDS infection, but also one of Africa's most progressive and
  comprehensive programs for dealing with the disease.

Economy Botswana


Economy - overview:
  Botswana has maintained one of the world's highest economic growth
  rates since independence in 1966. Through fiscal discipline and
  sound management, Botswana has transformed itself from one of the
  poorest countries in the world to a middle-income country with a per
  capita GDP of $11,200 in 2006. Two major investment services rank
  Botswana as the best credit risk in Africa. Diamond mining has
  fueled much of the expansion and currently accounts for more than
  one-third of GDP and for 70-80% of export earnings. Tourism,
  financial services, subsistence farming, and cattle raising are
  other key sectors. On the downside, the government must deal with
  high rates of unemployment and poverty. Unemployment officially was
  23.8% in 2004, but unofficial estimates place it closer to 40%.
  HIV/AIDS infection rates are the second highest in the world and
  threaten Botswana's impressive economic gains. An expected leveling
  off in diamond mining production overshadows long-term prospects.

@Bouvet Island

Introduction Bouvet Island


Background:
  This uninhabited volcanic island is almost entirely covered by
  glaciers and is difficult to approach. It was discovered in 1739 by
  a French naval officer after whom the island was named. No claim was
  made until 1825, when the British flag was raised. In 1928, the UK
  waived its claim in favor of Norway, which had occupied the island
  the previous year. In 1971, Bouvet Island and the adjacent
  territorial waters were designated a nature reserve. Since 1977,
  Norway has run an automated meteorological station on the island.

@Brazil

Introduction Brazil


Background:
  Following three centuries under the rule of Portugal, Brazil became
  an independent nation in 1822 and a republic in 1889. By far the
  largest and most populous country in South America, Brazil overcame
  more than half a century of military intervention in the governance
  of the country when in 1985 the military regime peacefully ceded
  power to civilian rulers. Brazil continues to pursue industrial and
  agricultural growth and development of its interior. Exploiting vast
  natural resources and a large labor pool, it is today South
  America's leading economic power and a regional leader. Highly
  unequal income distribution remains a pressing problem.

Economy Brazil


Economy - overview:
  Characterized by large and well-developed agricultural, mining,
  manufacturing, and service sectors, Brazil's economy outweighs that
  of all other South American countries and is expanding its presence
  in world markets. From 2001-03 real wages fell and Brazil's economy
  grew, on average only 2.2% per year, as the country absorbed a
  series of domestic and international economic shocks. That Brazil
  absorbed these shocks without financial collapse is a tribute to the
  resiliency of the Brazilian economy and the economic program put in
  place by former President CARDOSO and strengthened by President LULA
  DA SILVA. Since 2004, Brazil has enjoyed more robust growth that
  yielded increases in employment and real wages. The three pillars of
  the economic program are a floating exchange rate, an
  inflation-targeting regime, and tight fiscal policy, all reinforced
  by a series of IMF programs. The currency depreciated sharply in
  2001 and 2002, which contributed to a dramatic current account
  adjustment; from 2003 to 2006, Brazil ran record trade surpluses and
  recorded its first current account surpluses since 1992.
  Productivity gains - particularly in agriculture - also contributed
  to the surge in exports. While economic management has been good,
  there remain important economic vulnerabilities. The most
  significant are debt-related: the government's largely domestic debt
  increased steadily from 1994 to 2003 - straining government finances
  - before falling as a percentage of GDP in 2005. Brazil has improved
  its debt profile over the past year by shifting its debt burden
  toward real denominated and domestically held instruments. LULA DA
  SILVA restated his commitment to fiscal austerity by maintaining the
  country's primary surplus during the 2006 election and plans to pass
  a package of further economic reforms upon entering office for his
  second term. Another challenge is maintaining economic growth over a
  period of time to generate employment and make the government debt
  burden more manageable.

Transnational Issues Brazil


Disputes - international:
  unruly region at convergence of Argentina-Brazil-Paraguay borders
  is locus of money laundering, smuggling, arms and illegal narcotics

  uncontested dispute with Uruguay over certain islands in the
  Quarai/Cuareim and Invernada boundary streams and the resulting
  tripoint with Argentina; in 2004 Brazil submitted its claims to the
  United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) to extend
  its maritime continental margin

Trafficking in persons:
  current situation: Brazil is a source and destination country for
  women and girls trafficked for sexual exploitation within Brazil and
  to destinations in South America, the Caribbean, Western Europe,
  Japan, the US, and the Middle East, and for men trafficked within
  the country for forced agricultural labor; child sex tourism is a
  problem within the country, particularly in the resort areas and
  coastal cities of Brazil's northeast; foreign victims from Bolivia,
  Peru, China, and Korea are trafficked to Brazil for labor
  exploitation in factories
  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Brazil has failed to show evidence
  of increasing efforts to fight trafficking, specifically for its
  failure to apply effective criminal penalties against traffickers
  who exploit forced labor

Illicit drugs:
  illicit producer of cannabis; trace amounts of coca cultivation in
  the Amazon region, used for domestic consumption; government has a
  large-scale eradication program to control cannabis; important
  transshipment country for Bolivian, Colombian, and Peruvian cocaine
  headed for Europe; also used by traffickers as a way station for
  narcotics air transshipments between Peru and Colombia; upsurge in
  drug-related violence and weapons smuggling; important market for
  Colombian, Bolivian, and Peruvian cocaine; illicit narcotics
  proceeds earned in Brazil are often laundered through the financial
  system; significant illicit financial activity in the Tri-Border Area

@British Indian Ocean Territory

Introduction British Indian Ocean Territory


Background:
  Established as a territory of the UK in 1965, a number of the
  British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) islands were transferred to
  the Seychelles when it attained independence in 1976. Subsequently,
  BIOT has consisted only of the six main island groups comprising the
  Chagos Archipelago. The largest and most southerly of the islands,
  Diego Garcia, contains a joint UK-US naval support facility. All of
  the remaining islands are uninhabited. Former agricultural workers,
  earlier residents in the islands, were relocated primarily to
  Mauritius but also to the Seychelles, between 1967 and 1973. In
  2000, a British High Court ruling invalidated the local immigration
  order that had excluded them from the archipelago, but upheld the
  special military status of Diego Garcia.

Economy British Virgin Islands


Economy - overview:
  The economy, one of the most stable and prosperous in the
  Caribbean, is highly dependent on tourism, generating an estimated
  45% of the national income. An estimated 350,000 tourists, mainly
  from the US, visited the islands in 1998. Tourism suffered in 2002
  because of the lackluster US economy. In the mid-1980s, the
  government began offering offshore registration to companies wishing
  to incorporate in the islands, and incorporation fees now generate
  substantial revenues. Roughly 400,000 companies were on the offshore
  registry by yearend 2000. The adoption of a comprehensive insurance
  law in late 1994, which provides a blanket of confidentiality with
  regulated statutory gateways for investigation of criminal offenses,
  made the British Virgin Islands even more attractive to
  international business. Livestock raising is the most important
  agricultural activity; poor soils limit the islands' ability to meet
  domestic food requirements. Because of traditionally close links
  with the US Virgin Islands, the British Virgin Islands has used the
  US dollar as its currency since 1959.

Introduction Brunei


Background:
  The Sultanate of Brunei's influence peaked between the 15th and
  17th centuries when its control extended over coastal areas of
  northwest Borneo and the southern Philippines. Brunei subsequently
  entered a period of decline brought on by internal strife over royal
  succession, colonial expansion of European powers, and piracy. In
  1888, Brunei became a British protectorate; independence was
  achieved in 1984. The same family has ruled Brunei for over six
  centuries. Brunei benefits from extensive petroleum and natural gas
  fields, the source of one of the highest per capita GDPs in the
  developing world.

Economy Brunei


Economy - overview:
  This small, well-to-do economy encompasses a mixture of foreign and
  domestic entrepreneurship, government regulation, welfare measures,
  and village tradition. Crude oil and natural gas production account
  for nearly half of GDP and more than 90% of government revenues. Per
  capita GDP is far above most other Third World countries, and
  substantial income from overseas investment supplements income from
  domestic production. The government provides for all medical
  services and free education through the university level and
  subsidizes rice and housing. Brunei's leaders are concerned that
  steadily increased integration in the world economy will undermine
  internal social cohesion. Plans for the future include upgrading the
  labor force, reducing unemployment, strengthening the banking and
  tourist sectors, and, in general, further widening the economic base
  beyond oil and gas.

  encompassing Louisa Reef in southern Spratly Islands in 1984 but
  makes no public territorial claim to the offshore reefs; the 2002
  "Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea" has
  eased tensions in the Spratly Islands but falls short of a legally
  binding "code of conduct" desired by several of the disputants

Illicit drugs:
  drug trafficking and illegally importing controlled substances are
  serious offenses in Brunei and carry a mandatory death penalty

@Bulgaria

Introduction Bulgaria


Background:
  The Bulgars, a Central Asian Turkic tribe, merged with the local
  Slavic inhabitants in the late 7th century to form the first
  Bulgarian state. In succeeding centuries, Bulgaria struggled with
  the Byzantine Empire to assert its place in the Balkans, but by the
  end of the 14th century the country was overrun by the Ottoman
  Turks. Northern Bulgaria attained autonomy in 1878 and all of
  Bulgaria became independent from the Ottoman Empire in 1908. Having
  fought on the losing side in both World Wars, Bulgaria fell within
  the Soviet sphere of influence and became a People's Republic in
  1946. Communist domination ended in 1990, when Bulgaria held its
  first multiparty election since World War II and began the
  contentious process of moving toward political democracy and a
  market economy while combating inflation, unemployment, corruption,
  and crime. The country joined NATO in 2004 and the EU in 2007.

Economy Bulgaria


Economy - overview:
  Bulgaria, a former communist country that entered the European
  Union on 1 January 2007, has experienced macroeconomic stability and
  strong growth since a major economic downturn in 1996 led to the
  fall of the then socialist government. As a result, the government
  became committed to economic reform and responsible fiscal planning.
  Minerals, including coal, copper, and zinc, play an important role
  in industry. In 1997, macroeconomic stability was reinforced by the
  imposition of a fixed exchange rate of the lev against the German
  D-mark - the currency is now fixed against the euro - and the
  negotiation of an IMF standby agreement. Low inflation and steady
  progress on structural reforms improved the business environment;
  Bulgaria has averaged 5.1% growth since 2000 and has begun to
  attract significant amounts of foreign direct investment. Corruption
  in the public administration, a weak judiciary, and the presence of
  organized crime remain the largest challenges for Bulgaria.

@Burkina Faso

Introduction Burkina Faso


Background:
  Burkina Faso (formerly Upper Volta) achieved independence from
  France in 1960. Repeated military coups during the 1970s and 1980s
  were followed by multiparty elections in the early 1990s. Current
  President Blaise COMPAORE came to power in a 1987 military coup and
  has won every election since then. Burkina Faso's high population
  density and limited natural resources result in poor economic
  prospects for the majority of its citizens. Recent unrest in Cote
  d'Ivoire and northern Ghana has hindered the ability of several
  hundred thousand seasonal Burkinabe farm workers to find employment
  in neighboring countries.

Economy Burkina Faso


Economy - overview:
  One of the poorest countries in the world, landlocked Burkina Faso
  has few natural resources and a weak industrial base. About 90% of
  the population is engaged in subsistence agriculture, which is
  vulnerable to periodic drought. Cotton is the main cash crop and the
  government has joined with three other cotton producing countries in
  the region - Mali, Niger, and Chad - to lobby for improved access to
  Western markets. GDP growth has largely been driven by increases in
  world cotton prices. Industry remains dominated by unprofitable
  government-controlled corporations. Following the CFA franc currency
  devaluation in January 1994, the government updated its development
  program in conjunction with international agencies; exports and
  economic growth have increased. The government devolved
  macroeconomic policy and inflation targeting to the West African
  regional central bank (BCEAO), but maintains control over fiscal and
  microeconomic policies, including implementing reforms to encourage
  private investment. The bitter internal crisis in neighboring Cote
  d'Ivoire continues to hurt trade and industrial prospects and
  deepens the need for international assistance. Burkina Faso is
  eligible for a Millenium Challenge Account grant, which would
  increase investment in the country's human capital.

Introduction Burma


Background:
  Britain conquered Burma over a period of 62 years (1824-1886) and
  incorporated it into its Indian Empire. Burma was administered as a
  province of India until 1937 when it became a separate,
  self-governing colony; independence from the Commonwealth was
  attained in 1948. Gen. NE WIN dominated the government from 1962 to
  1988, first as military ruler, then as self-appointed president, and
  later as political kingpin. Despite multiparty legislative elections
  in 1990 that resulted in the main opposition party - the National
  League for Democracy (NLD) - winning a landslide victory, the ruling
  junta refused to hand over power. NLD leader and Nobel Peace Prize
  recipient AUNG SAN SUU KYI, who was under house arrest from 1989 to
  1995 and 2000 to 2002, was imprisoned in May 2003 and subsequently
  transferred to house arrest, where she remains virtually
  incommunicado. In February 2006, the junta extended her detention
  for another year. Her supporters, as well as all those who promote
  democracy and improved human rights, are routinely harassed or
  jailed.

Economy Burma


Economy - overview:
  Burma, a resource-rich country, suffers from pervasive government
  controls, inefficient economic policies, and rural poverty. The
  junta took steps in the early 1990s to liberalize the economy after
  decades of failure under the "Burmese Way to Socialism," but those
  efforts stalled, and some of the liberalization measures were
  rescinded. Lacking monetary or fiscal stability, the economy suffers
  from serious macroeconomic imbalances - including inflation,
  multiple official exchange rates that overvalue the Burmese kyat,
  and a distorted interest rate regime. Most overseas development
  assistance ceased after the junta began to suppress the democracy
  movement in 1988 and subsequently refused to honor the results of
  the 1990 legislative elections. In response to the government of
  Burma's attack in May 2003 on AUNG SAN SUU KYI and her convoy, the
  US imposed new economic sanctions against Burma - including a ban on
  imports of Burmese products and a ban on provision of financial
  services by US persons. A poor investment climate further slowed the
  inflow of foreign exchange. The most productive sectors will
  continue to be in extractive industries, especially oil and gas,
  mining, and timber. Other areas, such as manufacturing and services,
  are struggling with inadequate infrastructure, unpredictable
  import/export policies, deteriorating health and education systems,
  and corruption. A major banking crisis in 2003 shuttered the
  country's 20 private banks and disrupted the economy. As of 2006,
  the largest private banks operate under tight restrictions limiting
  the private sector's access to formal credit. Official statistics
  are inaccurate. Published statistics on foreign trade are greatly
  understated because of the size of the black market and unofficial
  border trade - often estimated to be as large as the official
  economy. Burma's trade with Thailand, China, and India is rising.
  Though the Burmese government has good economic relations with its
  neighbors, better investment and business climates and an improved
  political situation are needed to promote foreign investment,
  exports, and tourism.

Transnational Issues Burma


Disputes - international:
  over half of Burma's population consists of diverse ethnic groups
  with substantial numbers of kin beyond its borders; despite

  rebels, refugees, and illegal cross-border activities; ethnic Karens
  flee into Thailand to escape fighting between Karen rebels and
  Burmese troops; in 2005 Thailand sheltered about 121,000 Burmese
  refugees; Karens also protest Thai support for a Burmese
  hydroelectric dam on the Salween River near the border;
  environmentalists in Burma and Thailand continue to voice concern
  over China's construction of hydroelectric dams upstream on the
  Nujiang/Salween River in Yunnan Province; India seeks cooperation
  from Burma to keep Indian Nagaland separatists from hiding in remote
  Burmese uplands

Refugees and internally displaced persons:
  IDPs: 540,000 (government offensives against ethnic insurgent
  groups near the eastern borders; most IDPs are ethnic Karen,
  Karenni, Shan, Tavoyan, and Mon) (2006)

Trafficking in persons:
  current situation: Burma is a source country for men, women, and
  children trafficked to East and Southeast Asia for sexual
  exploitation, domestic service, and forced commercial labor; a
  significant number of victims are economic migrants who wind up in
  forced or bonded labor and forced prostitution; to a lesser extent,
  Burma is a country of transit and destination for women trafficked
  from China for sexual exploitation; internal trafficking of persons
  occurs primarily for labor in industrial zones and agricultural
  estates; internal trafficking of women and girls for sexual
  exploitation occurs from villages to urban centers and other areas;
  the military junta's economic mismanagement, human rights abuses,
  and policy of using forced labor are driving factors behind Burma's
  large trafficking problem
  tier rating: Tier 3 - Burma does not fully comply with the minimum
  standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making
  significant efforts to do so

Illicit drugs:
  remains world's second largest producer of illicit opium (estimated
  production in 2004 - 292 metric tons, down 40% from 2003 due to
  eradication efforts and drought; cultivation in 2004 - 30,900
  hectares, a 34% decline from 2003); lack of government will to take
  on major narcotrafficking groups and lack of serious commitment
  against money laundering continues to hinder the overall antidrug
  effort; major source of methamphetamine and heroin for regional
  consumption; currently under Financial Action Task Force
  countermeasures due to continued failure to address its inadequate
  money-laundering controls (2005)

@Burundi

Introduction Burundi


Background:
  Burundi's first democratically elected president was assassinated
  in October 1993 after only 100 days in office, triggering widespread
  ethnic violence between Hutu and Tutsi factions. Over 200,000
  Burundians perished during the conflict that spanned almost a dozen
  years. Hundreds of thousands of Burundians were internally displaced
  or became refugees in neighboring countries. An internationally
  brokered power-sharing agreement between the Tutsi-dominated
  government and the Hutu rebels in 2003 paved the way for a
  transition process that led to an integrated defense force,
  established a new constitution in 2005, and elected a majority Hutu
  government in 2005. The new government, led by President Pierre
  NKURUNZIZA, signed a South African brokered ceasefire with the
  country's last rebel group in September of 2006 but still faces many
  challenges.

Economy Burundi


Economy - overview:
  Burundi is a landlocked, resource-poor country with an
  underdeveloped manufacturing sector. The economy is predominantly
  agricultural with more than 90% of the population dependent on
  subsistence agriculture. Economic growth depends on coffee and tea
  exports, which account for 90% of foreign exchange earnings. The
  ability to pay for imports, therefore, rests primarily on weather
  conditions and international coffee and tea prices. The Tutsi
  minority, 14% of the population, dominates the government and the
  coffee trade at the expense of the Hutu majority, 85% of the
  population. An ethnic-based war that lasted for over a decade
  resulted in more than 200,000 deaths, forced more than 48,000
  refugees into Tanzania, and displaced 140,000 others internally.
  Only one in two children go to school, and approximately one in 10
  adults has HIV/AIDS. Food, medicine, and electricity remain in short
  supply. Political stability and the end of the civil war have
  improved aid flows and economic activity has increased, but
  underlying weaknesses - a high poverty rate, poor education rates, a
  weak legal system, and low administrative capacity - risk
  undermining planned economic reforms. Burundi grew about 5 percent
  in 2006. Delayed disbursements of funds from the World Bank may add
  to budget pressures in 2007. Burundi will continue to remain heavily
  dependent on aid from bilateral and multilateral donors.

  despite the presence of about 6,000 peacekeepers from the UN
  Operation in Burundi (ONUB) since 2004; although some 150,000
  Burundian refugees have been repatriated, as of February 2005,

@Cambodia

Introduction Cambodia


Background:
  Most Cambodians consider themselves to be Khmers, descendants of
  the Angkor Empire that extended over much of Southeast Asia and
  reached its zenith between the 10th and 13th centuries. Attacks by
  the Thai and Cham (from present-day Vietnam) weakened the empire
  ushering in a long period of decline. The king placed the country
  under French protection in 1863. Cambodia became part of French
  Indochina in 1887. Following Japanese occupation in World War II,
  Cambodia gained full independence from France in 1953. In April
  1975, after a five-year struggle, Communist Khmer Rouge forces
  captured Phnom Penh and evacuated all cities and towns. At least 1.5
  million Cambodians died from execution, forced hardships, or
  starvation during the Khmer Rouge regime under POL POT. A December
  1978 Vietnamese invasion drove the Khmer Rouge into the countryside,
  began a 10-year Vietnamese occupation, and touched off almost 13
  years of civil war. The 1991 Paris Peace Accords mandated democratic
  elections and a ceasefire, which was not fully respected by the
  Khmer Rouge. UN-sponsored elections in 1993 helped restore some
  semblance of normalcy under a coalition government. Factional
  fighting in 1997 ended the first coalition government, but a second
  round of national elections in 1998 led to the formation of another
  coalition government and renewed political stability. The remaining
  elements of the Khmer Rouge surrendered in early 1999. Some of the
  remaining Khmer Rouge leaders are awaiting trial by a UN-sponsored
  tribunal for crimes against humanity. Elections in July 2003 were
  relatively peaceful, but it took one year of negotiations between
  contending political parties before a coalition government was
  formed.

Economy Cambodia


Economy - overview:
  In 1999, the first full year of peace in 30 years, the government
  made progress on economic reforms. The US and Cambodia signed a
  Bilateral Textile Agreement, which gave Cambodia a guaranteed quota
  of US textile imports and established a bonus for improving working
  conditions and enforcing Cambodian labor laws and international
  labor standards in the industry. From 2001 to 2004, the economy grew
  at an average rate of 6.4%, driven largely by an expansion in the
  garment sector and tourism. With the January 2005 expiration of a
  WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing, Cambodia-based textile
  producers were forced to compete directly with lower-priced
  producing countries such as China and India. Better-than-expected
  garment sector performance led to about 6% growth per year in
  2005-06. Faced with the possibility that its vibrant garment
  industry, with more than 200,000 jobs, could be in serious danger,
  the Cambodian government has committed itself to a policy of
  continued support for high labor standards in an attempt to maintain
  favor with buyers. The tourism industry continues to grow rapidly,
  with foreign visitors surpassing 1 million for per year beginning in
  2005. In 2005, exploitable oil and natural gas deposits were found
  beneath Cambodia's territorial waters, representing a new revenue
  stream for the government once commercial extraction begins in the
  coming years. Mining also is attracting significant investor
  interest, particularly in the northeastern parts of the country. The
  long-term development of the economy remains a daunting challenge.
  The Cambodian government is working with bilateral and multilateral
  donors, including the World Bank and IMF, to address the country's
  many pressing needs. The major economic challenge for Cambodia over
  the next decade will be fashioning an economic environment in which
  the private sector can create enough jobs to handle Cambodia's
  demographic imbalance. More than 50% of the population is less than
  21 years old. The population lacks education and productive skills,
  particularly in the poverty-ridden countryside, which suffers from
  an almost total lack of basic infrastructure.

  completing most of their demarcations

Trafficking in persons:
  current situation: Cambodia is a source, destination, and transit
  country for men, women, and children trafficked for the purposes of
  sexual exploitation and forced labor; a significant number of women
  and children are trafficked to Thailand and Malaysia for commercial
  sexual exploitation and forced labor; men are trafficked primarily
  to Thailand for forced labor in the construction and agricultural
  sectors, particularly the fishing industry, while women and girls
  are trafficked for factory and domestic work; children are
  trafficked to Vietnam and Thailand for the purpose of forced
  begging; Cambodia is a transit and destination point for women from
  Vietnam trafficked for sexual exploitation; trafficking for sexual
  exploitation also occurs within Cambodia's borders, from rural areas
  to the cities
  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Cambodia does not fully comply with
  the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however,
  it is committed to making significant efforts to sustain progress
  over the coming year

Illicit drugs:
  narcotics-related corruption reportedly involving some in the
  government, military, and police; possible small-scale heroin and
  methamphetamine production; vulnerable to money laundering due to
  its cash-based economy and porous borders

Introduction Cameroon


Background:
  The former French Cameroon and part of British Cameroon merged in
  1961 to form the present country. Cameroon has generally enjoyed
  stability, which has permitted the development of agriculture,
  roads, and railways, as well as a petroleum industry. Despite a slow
  movement toward democratic reform, political power remains firmly in
  the hands of an ethnic oligarchy headed by President Paul BIYA.

Economy Cameroon


Economy - overview:
  Because of its modest oil resources and favorable agricultural
  conditions, Cameroon has one of the best-endowed primary commodity
  economies in sub-Saharan Africa. Still, it faces many of the serious
  problems facing other underdeveloped countries, such as a top-heavy
  civil service and a generally unfavorable climate for business
  enterprise. Since 1990, the government has embarked on various IMF
  and World Bank programs designed to spur business investment,
  increase efficiency in agriculture, improve trade, and recapitalize
  the nation's banks. In June 2000, the government completed an
  IMF-sponsored, three-year structural adjustment program; however,
  the IMF is pressing for more reforms, including increased budget
  transparency, privatization, and poverty reduction programs.
  International oil and cocoa prices have a significant impact on the
  economy.

  ICJ ruling on the Cameroon-Equatorial Guinea-Nigeria maritime
  boundary in the Gulf of Guinea is impeded by imprecisely defined
  coordinates and a sovereignty dispute between Equatorial Guinea and
  Cameroon over an island at the mouth of the Ntem River; Nigeria
  initially rejected cession of the Bakassi Peninsula, then agreed,
  but much of the indigenous population opposes cession; only Nigeria
  and Cameroon have heeded the Lake Chad Commission's admonition to
  ratify the delimitation treaty which also includes the Chad-Niger
  and Niger-Nigeria boundaries

Introduction Canada


Background:
  A land of vast distances and rich natural resources, Canada became
  a self-governing dominion in 1867 while retaining ties to the
  British crown. Economically and technologically the nation has
  developed in parallel with the US, its neighbor to the south across
  an unfortified border. Canada faces the political challenges of
  meeting public demands for quality improvements in health care and
  education services, as well as responding to separatist concerns in
  predominantly francophone Quebec. Canada also aims to develop its
  diverse energy resources while maintaining its commitment to the
  environment.

Geography Canada


Location:
  Northern North America, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean on the
  east, North Pacific Ocean on the west, and the Arctic Ocean on the
  north, north of the conterminous US

Geographic coordinates:
  60 00 N, 95 00 W

Map references:
  North America

Area:
  total: 9,984,670 sq km
  land: 9,093,507 sq km
  water: 891,163 sq km

  total: 8,893 km
  border countries: US 8,893 km (includes 2,477 km with Alaska)

Coastline:
  202,080 km

Maritime claims:
  territorial sea: 12 nm
  contiguous zone: 24 nm
  exclusive economic zone: 200 nm
  continental shelf: 200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin

Climate:
  varies from temperate in south to subarctic and arctic in north

Terrain:
  mostly plains with mountains in west and lowlands in southeast

Elevation extremes:
  lowest point: Atlantic Ocean 0 m

  other: 94.78% (2005)

Irrigated land:
  7,850 sq km (2003)

Natural hazards:
  continuous permafrost in north is a serious obstacle to
  development; cyclonic storms form east of the Rocky Mountains, a
  result of the mixing of air masses from the Arctic, Pacific, and
  North American interior, and produce most of the country's rain and
  snow east of the mountains

Environment - current issues:
  air pollution and resulting acid rain severely affecting lakes and
  damaging forests; metal smelting, coal-burning utilities, and
  vehicle emissions impacting on agricultural and forest productivity;
  ocean waters becoming contaminated due to agricultural, industrial,
  mining, and forestry activities

Environment - international agreements:
  party to: Air Pollution, Air Pollution-Nitrogen Oxides, Air
  Pollution-Persistent Organic Pollutants, Air Pollution-Sulfur 85,
  Air Pollution-Sulfur 94, Antarctic-Environmental Protocol,
  Antarctic-Marine Living Resources, Antarctic Seals, Antarctic
  Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol,
  Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification,
  Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer
  Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94,
  Wetlands
  signed, but not ratified: Air Pollution-Volatile Organic Compounds,
  Marine Life Conservation

Geography - note:
  second-largest country in world (after Russia); strategic location
  between Russia and US via north polar route; approximately 90% of
  the population is concentrated within 160 km of the US border

Economy Canada


Economy - overview:
  As an affluent, high-tech industrial society in the trillion dollar
  class, Canada resembles the US in its market-oriented economic
  system, pattern of production, and affluent living standards. Since
  World War II, the impressive growth of the manufacturing, mining,
  and service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural
  economy into one primarily industrial and urban. The 1989 US-Canada
  Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and the 1994 North American Free Trade
  Agreement (NAFTA) (which includes Mexico) touched off a dramatic
  increase in trade and economic integration with the US. Given its
  great natural resources, skilled labor force, and modern capital
  plant, Canada enjoys solid economic prospects. Top-notch fiscal
  management has produced consecutive balanced budgets since 1997,
  although public debate continues over how to manage the rising cost
  of the publicly funded healthcare system. Exports account for
  roughly a third of GDP. Canada enjoys a substantial trade surplus
  with its principal trading partner, the US, which absorbs about 85%
  of Canadian exports. Canada is the US' largest foreign supplier of
  energy, including oil, gas, uranium, and electric power.

@Cape Verde

Introduction Cape Verde


Background:
  The uninhabited islands were discovered and colonized by the
  Portuguese in the 15th century; Cape Verde subsequently became a
  trading center for African slaves and later an important coaling and
  resupply stop for whaling and transatlantic shipping. Following
  independence in 1975, and a tentative interest in unification with
  Guinea-Bissau, a one-party system was established and maintained
  until multi-party elections were held in 1990. Cape Verde continues
  to exhibit one of Africa's most stable democratic governments.
  Repeated droughts during the second half of the 20th century caused
  significant hardship and prompted heavy emigration. As a result,
  Cape Verde's expatriate population is greater than its domestic one.
  Most Cape Verdeans have both African and Portuguese antecedents.

Economy Cape Verde


Economy - overview:
  This island economy suffers from a poor natural resource base,
  including serious water shortages exacerbated by cycles of long-term
  drought. The economy is service-oriented, with commerce, transport,
  tourism, and public services accounting for 66% of GDP. Although
  nearly 70% of the population lives in rural areas, the share of food
  production in GDP in 2004 was only 12%, of which fishing accounted
  for 1.5%. About 82% of food must be imported. The fishing potential,
  mostly lobster and tuna, is not fully exploited. Cape Verde annually
  runs a high trade deficit, financed by foreign aid and remittances
  from emigrants; remittances supplement GDP by more than 20%.
  Economic reforms are aimed at developing the private sector and
  attracting foreign investment to diversify the economy. Future
  prospects depend heavily on the maintenance of aid flows, the
  encouragement of tourism, remittances, and the momentum of the
  government's development program. Cape Verde has been exploring
  European Union membership in recent years.

@Central African Republic

Introduction Central African Republic


Background:
  The former French colony of Ubangi-Shari became the Central African
  Republic upon independence in 1960. After three tumultuous decades
  of misrule - mostly by military governments - civilian rule was
  established in 1993 and lasted for one decade. President Ange-Felix
  PATASSE's civilian government was plagued by unrest, and in March
  2003 he was deposed in a military coup led by General Francois
  BOZIZE, who established a transitional government. Though the
  government has the tacit support of civil society groups and the
  main parties, a wide field of candidates contested the municipal,
  legislative, and presidential elections held in March and May of
  2005 in which General BOZIZE was affirmed as president. The
  government still does not fully control the countryside, where
  pockets of lawlessness persist.

Economy Central African Republic


Economy - overview:
  Subsistence agriculture, together with forestry, remains the
  backbone of the economy of the Central African Republic (CAR), with
  more than 70% of the population living in outlying areas. The
  agricultural sector generates more than half of GDP. Timber has
  accounted for about 16% of export earnings and the diamond industry,
  for 40%. Important constraints to economic development include the
  CAR's landlocked position, a poor transportation system, a largely
  unskilled work force, and a legacy of misdirected macroeconomic
  policies. Factional fighting between the government and its
  opponents remains a drag on economic revitalization. Distribution of
  income is extraordinarily unequal. Grants from France and the
  international community can only partially meet humanitarian needs.

@Chad

Introduction Chad


Background:
  Chad, part of France's African holdings until 1960, endured three
  decades of civil warfare as well as invasions by Libya before a
  semblance of peace was finally restored in 1990. The government
  eventually drafted a democratic constitution, and held flawed
  presidential elections in 1996 and 2001. In 1998, a rebellion broke
  out in northern Chad, which sporadically flares up despite several
  peace agreements between the government and the rebels. In 2005 new
  rebel groups emerged in western Sudan and have made probing attacks
  into eastern Chad. Power remains in the hands of an ethnic minority.
  In June 2005, President Idriss DEBY held a referendum successfully
  removing constitutional term limits.

Economy Chad


Economy - overview:
  Chad's primarily agricultural economy will continue to be boosted
  by major foreign direct investment projects in the oil sector that
  began in 2000. Over 80% of Chad's population relies on subsistence
  farming and livestock raising for its livelihood. Chad's economy has
  long been handicapped by its landlocked position, high energy costs,
  and a history of instability. Chad relies on foreign assistance and
  foreign capital for most public and private sector investment
  projects. A consortium led by two US companies has been investing
  $3.7 billion to develop oil reserves - estimated at 1 billion
  barrels - in southern Chad. The nation's total oil reserves has been
  estimated to be 2 billion barrels. Oil production came on stream in
  late 2003. Chad began to export oil in 2004. Cotton, cattle, and gum
  arabic provide the bulk of Chad's non-oil export earnings.

@Chile

Introduction Chile


Background:
  Prior to the coming of the Spanish in the 16th century, northern
  Chile was under Inca rule while Araucanian Indians inhabited central
  and southern Chile; the latter were not completely subjugated by
  Spain until the early 1880s. Although Chile declared its
  independence in 1810, decisive victory over the Spanish was not
  achieved until 1818. In the War of the Pacific (1879-84), Chile
  defeated Peru and Bolivia and won its present northern lands. A
  three-year-old Marxist government of Salvador ALLENDE was overthrown
  in 1973 by a dictatorial military regime led by Augusto PINOCHET,
  who ruled until a freely elected president was installed in 1990.
  Sound economic policies, maintained consistently since the 1980s,
  have contributed to steady growth and have helped secure the
  country's commitment to democratic and representative government.
  Chile has increasingly assumed regional and international leadership
  roles befitting its status as a stable, democratic nation.

Economy Chile


Economy - overview:
  Chile has a market-oriented economy characterized by a high level
  of foreign trade. During the early 1990s, Chile's reputation as a
  role model for economic reform was strengthened when the democratic
  government of Patricio AYLWIN - which took over from the military in
  1990 - deepened the economic reform initiated by the military
  government. Growth in real GDP averaged 8% during 1991-97, but fell
  to half that level in 1998 because of tight monetary policies
  implemented to keep the current account deficit in check and because
  of lower export earnings - the latter a product of the global
  financial crisis. A severe drought exacerbated the recession in
  1999, reducing crop yields and causing hydroelectric shortfalls and
  electricity rationing, and Chile experienced negative economic
  growth for the first time in more than 15 years. Despite the effects
  of the recession, Chile maintained its reputation for strong
  financial institutions and sound policy that have given it the
  strongest sovereign bond rating in South America. By the end of
  1999, exports and economic activity had begun to recover, and growth
  rebounded to 4.2% in 2000. Growth fell back to 3.1% in 2001 and 2.1%
  in 2002, largely due to lackluster global growth and the devaluation
  of the Argentine peso. Chile's economy began a slow recovery in
  2003, growing 3.2%, and accelerated to about 5% per year in 2004-06,
  while Chile maintained a low rate of inflation. GDP growth benefited
  from high copper prices, solid export earnings (particularly
  forestry, fishing, and mining), and stepped-up foreign direct
  investment. Unemployment has exhibited a downward trend over the
  past year, but remains fairly high. Chile deepened its longstanding
  commitment to trade liberalization with the signing of a free trade
  agreement with the US, which took effect on 1 January 2004. Chile
  signed a free trade agreement with China in November 2005, and it
  already has several trade deals signed with other nations and blocs,
  including the European Union, Mercosur, South Korea, and Mexico.
  Record-high copper prices helped to strengthen the peso to a 6 1/2-year
  high, as of December 2006, and added investment in the mining sector
  will boost GDP in 2007.

Transnational Issues Chile


Disputes - international:
  Chile rebuffs Bolivia's reactivated claim to restore the Atacama
  corridor, ceded to Chile in 1884, offering instead unrestricted but
  not sovereign maritime access through Chile to Bolivian gas and
  other commodities; Peru proposes changing its latitudinal maritime
  boundary with Chile to an equidistance line with a southwestern
  axis; territorial claim in Antarctica (Chilean Antarctic Territory)
  partially overlaps Argentine and British claims; action by the joint
  boundary commission, established by Chile and Argentina in 2001, for
  mapping and demarcating the disputed boundary in the Andean Southern
  Ice Field (Campo de Hielo Sur) remains pending

Illicit drugs:
  important transshipment country for cocaine destined for Europe;
  economic prosperity and increasing trade have made Chile more
  attractive to traffickers seeking to launder drug profits,
  especially through the Iquique Free Trade Zone, but a new
  anti-money-laundering law improves controls; imported precursors
  passed on to Bolivia; domestic cocaine consumption is rising

Introduction China


Background:
  For centuries China stood as a leading civilization, outpacing the
  rest of the world in the arts and sciences, but in the 19th and
  early 20th centuries, the country was beset by civil unrest, major
  famines, military defeats, and foreign occupation. After World War
  II, the Communists under MAO Zedong established an autocratic
  socialist system that, while ensuring China's sovereignty, imposed
  strict controls over everyday life and cost the lives of tens of
  millions of people. After 1978, his successor DENG Xiaoping and
  other leaders focused on market-oriented economic development and by
  2000 output had quadrupled. For much of the population, living
  standards have improved dramatically and the room for personal
  choice has expanded, yet political controls remain tight.

Economy China


Economy - overview:
  China's economy during the last quarter century has changed from a
  centrally planned system that was largely closed to international
  trade to a more market-oriented economy that has a rapidly growing
  private sector and is a major player in the global economy. Reforms
  started in the late 1970s with the phasing out of collectivized
  agriculture, and expanded to include the gradual liberalization of
  prices, fiscal decentralization, increased autonomy for state
  enterprises, the foundation of a diversified banking system, the
  development of stock markets, the rapid growth of the non-state
  sector, and the opening to foreign trade and investment. China has
  generally implemented reforms in a gradualist or piecemeal fashion,
  including the sale of equity in China's largest state banks to
  foreign investors and refinements in foreign exchange and bond
  markets in 2005. The restructuring of the economy and resulting
  efficiency gains have contributed to a more than tenfold increase in
  GDP since 1978. Measured on a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis,
  China in 2006 stood as the second-largest economy in the world after
  the US, although in per capita terms the country is still lower
  middle-income and 130 million Chinese fall below international
  poverty lines. Economic development has generally been more rapid in
  coastal provinces than in the interior, and there are large
  disparities in per capita income between regions. The government has
  struggled to: (a) sustain adequate job growth for tens of millions
  of workers laid off from state-owned enterprises, migrants, and new
  entrants to the work force; (b) reduce corruption and other economic
  crimes; and (c) contain environmental damage and social strife
  related to the economy's rapid transformation. From 100 to 150
  million surplus rural workers are adrift between the villages and
  the cities, many subsisting through part-time, low-paying jobs. One
  demographic consequence of the "one child" policy is that China is
  now one of the most rapidly aging countries in the world. Another
  long-term threat to growth is the deterioration in the environment -
  notably air pollution, soil erosion, and the steady fall of the
  water table, especially in the north. China continues to lose arable
  land because of erosion and economic development. China has
  benefited from a huge expansion in computer Internet use, with more
  than 100 million users at the end of 2005. Foreign investment
  remains a strong element in China's remarkable expansion in world
  trade and has been an important factor in the growth of urban jobs.
  In July 2005, China revalued its currency by 2.1% against the US
  dollar and moved to an exchange rate system that references a basket
  of currencies. In 2006 China had the largest current account surplus
  - nearly $180 billion - in the world. More power generating capacity
  came on line in 2006 as large scale investments were completed.
  Thirteen years in construction at a cost of $24 billion, the immense
  Three Gorges Dam across the Yangtze River was essentially completed
  in 2006 and will revolutionize electrification and flood control in
  the area. The 11th Five-Year Program (2006-10), approved by the
  National People's Congress in March 2006, calls for a 20% reduction
  in energy consumption per unit of GDP by 2010 and an estimated 45%
  increase in GDP by 2010. The plan states that conserving resources
  and protecting the environment are basic goals, but it lacks details
  on the policies and reforms necessary to achieve these goals.

Transnational Issues China


Disputes - international:
  in 2005, China and India began drafting principles to resolve all
  aspects of their extensive boundary and territorial disputes
  together with a security and foreign policy dialogue to consolidate
  discussions related to the boundary, regional nuclear proliferation,
  and other matters; recent talks and confidence-building measures
  have begun to defuse tensions over Kashmir, site of the world's
  largest and most militarized territorial dispute with portions under
  the de facto administration of China (Aksai Chin), India (Jammu and
  Kashmir), and Pakistan (Azad Kashmir and Northern Areas); India does
  not recognize Pakistan's ceding historic Kashmir lands to China in
  1964; about 90,000 ethnic Tibetan exiles reside primarily in India
  as well as Nepal and Bhutan; China asserts sovereignty over the
  Spratly Islands together with Malaysia, Philippines, Taiwan,
  Vietnam, and possibly Brunei; the 2002 "Declaration on the Conduct
  of Parties in the South China Sea" has eased tensions in the
  Spratlys but is not the legally binding "code of conduct" sought by
  some parties; Vietnam and China continue to expand construction of
  facilities in the Spratlys and in March 2005, the national oil
  companies of China, the Philippines, and Vietnam signed a joint
  accord on marine seismic activities in the Spratly Islands; China
  occupies some of the Paracel Islands also claimed by Vietnam and
  Taiwan; China and Taiwan have become more vocal in rejecting both
  Japan's claims to the uninhabited islands of Senkaku-shoto (Diaoyu
  Tai) and Japan's unilaterally declared equidistance line in the East
  China Sea, the site of intensive hydrocarbon prospecting; certain
  islands in the Yalu and Tumen rivers are in an uncontested dispute
  with North Korea and a section of boundary around Mount Paektu is
  considered indefinite; China seeks to stem illegal migration of tens
  of thousands of North Koreans; China and Russia prepare to demarcate
  the boundary agreed to in October 2004 between the long-disputed
  islands at the Amur and Ussuri; demarcation of the China-Vietnam
  boundary proceeds slowly and although the maritime boundary
  delimitation and fisheries agreements were ratified in June 2004,
  implementation has been delayed; environmentalists in Burma and
  Thailand remain concerned about China's construction of
  hydroelectric dams upstream on the Nujiang/Salween River in Yunnan
  Province

Refugees and internally displaced persons:
  refugees (country of origin): 300,897 (Vietnam) estimated
  30,000-50,000 (North Korea)
  IDPs: 90,000 (2006)

Trafficking in persons:
  current situation: China is a source, transit, and destination
  country for women, men, and children trafficked for purposes of
  sexual exploitation and forced labor; the majority of trafficking in
  China is internal, but there is also international trafficking of
  Chinese citizens; women are lured through false promises of
  legitimate employment into commercial sexual exploitation in Taiwan,
  Thailand, Malaysia, and Japan; Chinese men and women are smuggled to
  countries throughout the world at enormous personal expense and then
  forced into commercial sexual exploitation or exploitative labor to
  repay debts to traffickers; women and children are trafficked into
  China from Mongolia, Burma, North Korea, Russia, and Vietnam for
  forced labor, marriage, and sexual slavery; most North Koreans enter
  northeastern China voluntarily, but others reportedly are trafficked
  into China from North Korea; domestic trafficking remains the most
  significant problem in China, with an estimated minimum of
  10,000-20,000 victims trafficked each year; the actual number of
  victims could be much greater; some experts believe that the serious
  and prolonged imbalance in the male-female birth ratio may now be
  contributing to Chinese and foreign girls and women being trafficked
  as potential brides
  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - China failed to show evidence of
  increasing efforts to address transnational trafficking; while the
  government provides reasonable protection to internal victims of
  trafficking, protection for Chinese and foreign victims of
  transnational trafficking remain inadequate

Illicit drugs:
  major transshipment point for heroin produced in the Golden
  Triangle; growing domestic drug abuse problem; source country for
  chemical precursors and methamphetamine

@Colombia

Introduction Colombia


Background:
  Colombia was one of the three countries that emerged from the
  collapse of Gran Colombia in 1830 (the others are Ecuador and
  Venezuela). A 40-year conflict between government forces and
  anti-government insurgent groups and illegal paramilitary groups -
  both heavily funded by the drug trade - escalated during the 1990s.
  The insurgents lack the military or popular support necessary to
  overthrow the government, and violence has been decreasing since
  about 2002, but insurgents continue attacks against civilians and
  large swaths of the countryside are under guerrilla influence.
  Paramilitary groups challenge the insurgents for control of
  territory and the drug trade. Most paramilitary members have
  demobilized since 2002 in an ongoing peace process, although their
  commitment to ceasing illicit activity is unclear. The Colombian
  Government has stepped up efforts to reassert government control
  throughout the country, and now has a presence in every one of its
  municipalities. However, neighboring countries worry about the
  violence spilling over their borders.

Economy Colombia


Economy - overview:
  Colombia's economy has experienced positive growth over the past
  three years despite a serious armed conflict. The economy continues
  to improve in part because of austere government budgets, focused
  efforts to reduce public debt levels, an export-oriented growth
  strategy, an improved security situation in the country, and high
  commodity prices. Ongoing economic problems facing President URIBE
  range from reforming the pension system to reducing high
  unemployment, and to achieving congressional passage of a fiscal
  transfers reform. New exploration is needed to offset declining oil
  production. International and domestic financial analysts note with
  concern the growing central government deficit, which hovers at 5%

Illicit drugs:

  hectares, virtually unchanged from 2003, but down one-third from its
  peak of 169,800 ha); producing a potential of 430 mt of pure
  cocaine; the world's largest producer of coca derivatives; supplying
  most of the US market and the great majority of cocaine to other
  international drug markets; important supplier of heroin to the US
  market; opium poppy cultivation fell 50% between 2003 and 2004 to
  2,100 hectares yielding a potential 3.8 metric tons of pure heroin,
  mostly for the US market; in 2004, aerial eradication treated over
  130,000 hectares of coca but aggressive replanting on the part of
  growers means Colombia remains a key producer; a significant portion
  of non-US narcotics proceeds are either laundered or invested in
  Colombia through the black market peso exchange

Economy Comoros


Economy - overview:
  One of the world's poorest countries, Comoros is made up of three
  islands that have inadequate transportation links, a young and
  rapidly increasing population, and few natural resources. The low
  educational level of the labor force contributes to a subsistence
  level of economic activity, high unemployment, and a heavy
  dependence on foreign grants and technical assistance. Agriculture,
  including fishing, hunting, and forestry, contributes 40% to GDP,
  employs 80% of the labor force, and provides most of the exports.
  The country is not self-sufficient in food production; rice, the
  main staple, accounts for the bulk of imports. The government -
  which is hampered by internal political disputes - is struggling to
  upgrade education and technical training, privatize commercial and
  industrial enterprises, improve health services, diversify exports,
  promote tourism, and reduce the high population growth rate.
  Increased foreign support is essential if the goal of 4% annual GDP
  growth is to be met. Remittances from 150,000 Comorans abroad help
  supplement GDP.

@Congo, Democratic Republic of the

Introduction Congo, Democratic Republic of the


Background:
  Established as a Belgian colony in 1908, the Republic of the Congo
  gained its independence in 1960, but its early years were marred by
  political and social instability. Col. Joseph MOBUTU seized power
  and declared himself president in a November 1965 coup. He
  subsequently changed his name - to MOBUTU Sese Seko - as well as
  that of the country - to Zaire. MOBUTU retained his position for 32
  years through several subsequent sham elections, as well as through
  the use of brutal force. Ethnic strife and civil war, touched off by
  a massive inflow of refugees in 1994 from fighting in Rwanda and
  Burundi, led in May 1997 to the toppling of the MOBUTU regime by a
  rebellion led by Laurent KABILA. He renamed the country the
  Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), but in August 1998 his
  regime was itself challenged by an insurrection backed by Rwanda and
  Uganda. Troops from Angola, Chad, Namibia, Sudan, and Zimbabwe
  intervened to support the Kinshasa regime. A cease-fire was signed
  in July 1999 by the DRC, Congolese armed rebel groups, Angola,
  Namibia, Rwanda, Uganda, and Zimbabwe but sporadic fighting
  continued. Laurent KABILA was assassinated in January 2001 and his
  son, Joseph KABILA, was named head of state. In October 2002, the
  new president was successful in negotiating the withdrawal of
  Rwandan forces occupying eastern Congo; two months later, the
  Pretoria Accord was signed by all remaining warring parties to end
  the fighting and establish a government of national unity. A
  transitional government was set up in July 2003; with Joseph KABILA
  as president and joined by four vice presidents representing the
  former government, former rebel groups, and the political
  opposition. The transitional government held a successful
  constitutional referendum in December 2005 and elections for the
  presidency, National Assembly, and provincial legislatures in 2006.
  KABILA was inaugurated president in December 2006.

Economy Congo, Democratic Republic of the


Economy - overview:
  The economy of the Democratic Republic of the Congo - a nation
  endowed with vast potential wealth - has declined drastically since
  the mid-1980s. The war, which began in August 1998, dramatically
  reduced national output and government revenue, increased external
  debt, and resulted in the deaths of perhaps 3.5 million people from
  violence, famine, and disease. Foreign businesses curtailed
  operations due to uncertainty about the outcome of the conflict,
  lack of infrastructure, and the difficult operating environment.
  Conditions improved in late 2002 with the withdrawal of a large
  portion of the invading foreign troops. The transitional government
  has reopened relations with international financial institutions and
  international donors, and President KABILA has begun implementing
  reforms. Much economic activity lies outside the GDP data. Economic
  stability improved in 2003-06, although an uncertain legal
  framework, corruption, and a lack of openness in government policy
  continues to hamper growth. In 2005-06, renewed activity in the
  mining sector, the source of most exports, boosted Kinshasa's fiscal
  position and GDP growth. Business and economic prospects are
  expected to improve once a new government is installed after
  elections.

  UN Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
  (MONUC) has maintained over 14,000 peacekeepers in the region since
  1999; thousands of Ituri refugees from the Congo continue to flee
  the fighting primarily into Uganda; 90,000 Angolan refugees were
  repatriated by 2004 with the remainder in the DRC expected to return
  in 2005; in 2005, DRC and Rwanda established a border verification
  mechanism to address accusations of Rwandan military supporting
  Congolese rebels and the DRC providing rebel Rwandan "Interhamwe"
  forces the means and bases to attack Rwandan forces; the location of
  the boundary in the broad Congo River with the Republic of the Congo
  is indefinite except in the Pool Malebo/Stanley Pool area

  IDPs: 1.1 million (fighting between government forces and rebels
  since mid-1990s; most IDPs are in eastern provinces) (2006)

Illicit drugs:
  illicit producer of cannabis, mostly for domestic consumption;
  while rampant corruption and inadequate supervision leaves the
  banking system vulnerable to money laundering, the lack of a
  well-developed financial system limits the country's utility as a
  money-laundering center

@Congo, Republic of the

Introduction Congo, Republic of the


Background:
  Upon independence in 1960, the former French region of Middle Congo
  became the Republic of the Congo. A quarter century of
  experimentation with Marxism was abandoned in 1990 and a
  democratically elected government took office in 1992. A brief civil
  war in 1997 restored former Marxist President Denis SASSOU-NGUESSO,
  and ushered in a period of ethnic and political unrest.
  Southern-based rebel groups agreed to a final peace accord in March
  2003, but the calm is tenuous and refugees continue to present a
  humanitarian crisis. The Republic of Congo was once one of Africa's
  largest petroleum producers, but with declining production it will
  need to hope for new offshore oil finds to sustain its oil earnings
  over the long term.

Economy Congo, Republic of the


Economy - overview:
  The economy is a mixture of village agriculture and handicrafts, an
  industrial sector based largely on oil, support services, and a
  government characterized by budget problems and overstaffing. Oil
  has supplanted forestry as the mainstay of the economy, providing a
  major share of government revenues and exports. In the early 1980s,
  rapidly rising oil revenues enabled the government to finance
  large-scale development projects with GDP growth averaging 5%
  annually, one of the highest rates in Africa. The government has
  mortgaged a substantial portion of its oil earnings through
  oil-backed loans that have contributed to a growing debt burden and
  chronic revenue shortfalls. Economic reform efforts have been
  undertaken with the support of international organizations, notably
  the World Bank and the IMF. However, the reform program came to a
  halt in June 1997 when civil war erupted. Denis SASSOU-NGUESSO, who
  returned to power when the war ended in October 1997, publicly
  expressed interest in moving forward on economic reforms and
  privatization and in renewing cooperation with international
  financial institutions. Economic progress was badly hurt by slumping
  oil prices and the resumption of armed conflict in December 1998,
  which worsened the republic's budget deficit. The current
  administration presides over an uneasy internal peace and faces
  difficult economic challenges of stimulating recovery and reducing
  poverty. Recovery of oil prices has boosted the economy's GDP and
  near-term prospects. In March 2006, the World Bank and the
  International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved Heavily Indebted Poor
  Countries (HIPC) treatment for Congo.

  of skilled workers to New Zealand and government deficits are
  continuing problems.

Economy Cook Islands


Economy - overview:
  Like many other South Pacific island nations, the Cook Islands'
  economic development is hindered by the isolation of the country
  from foreign markets, the limited size of domestic markets, lack of
  natural resources, periodic devastation from natural disasters, and
  inadequate infrastructure. Agriculture, employing about 70% of the
  working population, provides the economic base with major exports
  made up of copra and citrus fruit. Black pearls are the Cook
  Island's leading export. Manufacturing activities are limited to
  fruit processing, clothing, and handicrafts. Trade deficits are
  offset by remittances from emigrants and by foreign aid,
  overwhelmingly from New Zealand. In the 1980s and 1990s, the country
  lived beyond its means, maintaining a bloated public service and
  accumulating a large foreign debt. Subsequent reforms, including the
  sale of state assets, the strengthening of economic management, the
  encouragement of tourism, and a debt restructuring agreement, have
  rekindled investment and growth.

@Costa Rica

Introduction Costa Rica


Background:
  Although explored by the Spanish early in the 16th century, initial
  attempts at colonizing Costa Rica proved unsuccessful due to a
  combination of factors, including: disease from mosquito-infested
  swamps, brutal heat, resistance by natives, and pirate raids. It was
  not until 1563 that a permanent settlement of Cartago was
  established in the cooler, fertile central highlands. The area
  remained a colony for some two and a half centuries. In 1821, Costa
  Rica became one of several Central American provinces that jointly
  declared their independence from Spain. Two years later it joined
  the United Provinces of Central America, but this federation
  disintegrated in 1838, at which time Costa Rica proclaimed its
  sovereignty and independence. Since the late 19th century, only two
  brief periods of violence have marred the country's democratic
  development. Although it still maintains a large agricultural
  sector, Costa Rica has expanded its economy to include strong
  technology and tourism industries. The standard of living is
  relatively high. Land ownership is widespread.

Economy Costa Rica


Economy - overview:
  Costa Rica's basically stable economy depends on tourism,
  agriculture, and electronics exports. Poverty has been substantially
  reduced over the past 15 years, and a strong social safety net has
  been put into place. Foreign investors remain attracted by the
  country's political stability and high education levels, and tourism
  continues to bring in foreign exchange. The government continues to
  grapple with its large internal and external deficits and sizable
  internal debt. The reduction of inflation remains a difficult
  problem because of rising import prices, labor market rigidities,
  and fiscal deficits. The country also needs to reform its tax system
  and its pattern of public expenditure. The current administration
  has made it a priority to pass the necessary reforms to implement
  the US-Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA). CAFTA
  implementation would result in an improved investment climate.

@Cote d'Ivoire

Introduction Cote d'Ivoire


Background:
  Close ties to France since independence in 1960, the development of
  cocoa production for export, and foreign investment made Cote
  d'Ivoire one of the most prosperous of the tropical African states,
  but did not protect it from political turmoil. In December 1999, a
  military coup - the first ever in Cote d'Ivoire's history -
  overthrew the government. Junta leader Robert GUEI blatantly rigged
  elections held in late 2000 and declared himself the winner. Popular
  protest forced him to step aside and brought runner-up Laurent
  GBAGBO into power. Ivorian dissidents and disaffected members of the
  military launched a failed coup attempt in September 2002. Rebel
  forces claimed the northern half of the country, and in January 2003
  were granted ministerial positions in a unity government under the
  auspices of the Linas-Marcoussis Peace Accord. President GBAGBO and
  rebel forces resumed implementation of the peace accord in December
  2003 after a three-month stalemate, but issues that sparked the
  civil war, such as land reform and grounds for citizenship, remain
  unresolved. The central government has yet to exert control over the
  northern regions and tensions remain high between GBAGBO and
  opposition leaders. Several thousand French and West African troops
  remain in Cote d'Ivoire to maintain peace and facilitate the
  disarmament, demobilization, and rehabilitation process.

Economy Cote d'Ivoire


Economy - overview:
  Cote d'Ivoire is among the world's largest producers and exporters
  of coffee, cocoa beans, and palm oil. Consequently, the economy is
  highly sensitive to fluctuations in international prices for these
  products and weather conditions. Despite government attempts to
  diversify the economy, it is still heavily dependent on agriculture
  and related activities, engaging roughly 68% of the population.
  Growth was negative in 2000-03 because of the difficulty of meeting
  the conditions of international donors, continued low prices of key
  exports, foreign divestment and civil war. Political turmoil has
  continued to damage the economy since 2004, with a rising risk
  premium associated with doing business in the country, foreign
  investment shriveling, transportation costs increasing, French
  businesses fleeing, and criminal elements that traffic in weapons
  and diamonds gaining ground. The government will continue to survive
  financially off of the sale of cocoa, which represents 90% of
  foreign exchange earnings, but the government will probably lose
  between 10% and 20% of its cocoa harvest to northern rebels who
  smuggle the cocoa they control to neighboring countries where cocoa
  prices are higher. The government remains hopeful that ongoing
  exploration of Cote d'Ivoire's offshore oil reserves will result in
  significant production that could boost daily crude output from
  roughly 33,000 barrels per day (b/d) to more than 200,000 b/d by the
  end of the decade.

Introduction Croatia


Background:
  The lands that today comprise Croatia were part of the
  Austro-Hungarian Empire until the close of World War I. In 1918, the
  Croats, Serbs, and Slovenes formed a kingdom known after 1929 as
  Yugoslavia. Following World War II, Yugoslavia became a federal
  independent Communist state under the strong hand of Marshal TITO.
  Although Croatia declared its independence from Yugoslavia in 1991,
  it took four years of sporadic, but often bitter, fighting before
  occupying Serb armies were mostly cleared from Croatian lands. Under
  UN supervision, the last Serb-held enclave in eastern Slavonia was
  returned to Croatia in 1998.

Economy Croatia


Economy - overview:
  Before the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the Republic of Croatia,
  after Slovenia, was the most prosperous and industrialized area with
  a per capita output perhaps one-third above the Yugoslav average.
  The economy emerged from a mild recession in 2000 with tourism,
  banking, and public investments leading the way. Unemployment
  remains high, at about 17%, with structural factors slowing its
  decline. While macroeconomic stabilization has largely been
  achieved, structural reforms lag because of deep resistance on the
  part of the public and lack of strong support from politicians.
  Growth, while impressive at about 3% to 4% for the last several
  years, has been stimulated, in part, through high fiscal deficits
  and rapid credit growth. The EU accession process should accelerate
  fiscal and structural reform.

  commerce through southeastern Europe while encouraging close
  cross-border ties with Croatia

Introduction Cuba


Background:
  The native Amerindian population of Cuba began to decline after the
  European discovery of the island by Christopher COLUMBUS in 1492 and
  following its development as a Spanish colony during the next
  several centuries. Large numbers of African slaves were imported to
  work the coffee and sugar plantations, and Havana became the
  launching point for the annual treasure fleets bound for Spain from
  Mexico and Peru. Spanish rule, marked initially by neglect, became
  increasingly repressive, provoking an independence movement and
  occasional rebellions that were harshly suppressed. It was US
  intervention during the Spanish-American War in 1898 that finally
  overthrew Spanish rule. The subsequent Treaty of Paris established
  Cuban independence, which was granted in 1902 after a three-year
  transition period. Fidel CASTRO led a rebel army to victory in 1959;
  his iron rule has held the regime together since then. Cuba's
  Communist revolution, with Soviet support, was exported throughout
  Latin America and Africa during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. The
  country is now slowly recovering from a severe economic recession in
  1990, following the withdrawal of former Soviet subsidies, worth $4
  billion to $6 billion annually. Cuba portrays its difficulties as
  the result of the US embargo in place since 1961. Illicit migration
  to the US - using homemade rafts, alien smugglers, air flights, or
  via the southwest border - is a continuing problem. The US Coast
  Guard intercepted 2,810 individuals attempting to cross the Straits
  of Florida in fiscal year 2006.

Economy Cuba


Economy - overview:
  The government continues to balance the need for economic loosening
  against a desire for firm political control. It has rolled back
  limited reforms undertaken in the 1990s to increase enterprise
  efficiency and alleviate serious shortages of food, consumer goods,
  and services. The average Cuban's standard of living remains at a
  lower level than before the downturn of the 1990s, which was caused
  by the loss of Soviet aid and domestic inefficiencies. In 2006, high
  metals prices continued to boost Cuban earnings from nickel and
  cobalt production. Havana continued to invest in the country's
  energy sector to mitigate electrical blackouts that have plagued the
  country since 2004.

  labor; Cuba is a major destination for sex tourism, which largely
  caters to European, Canadian, and Latin American tourists and
  involves large numbers of minors; there are reports that Cuban women
  have been trafficked to Mexico for sexual exploitation; forced labor
  victims also include children coerced into working in commercial
  agriculture
  tier rating: Tier 3 - Cuba does not fully comply with the minimum
  standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making
  significant efforts to do so

Illicit drugs:
  territorial waters and air space serve as transshipment zone for US
  and European-bound drugs; established the death penalty for certain
  drug-related crimes in 1999

Introduction Cyprus


Background:
  A former British colony, Cyprus became independent in 1960
  following years of resistance to British rule. Tensions between the
  Greek Cypriot majority and Turkish Cypriot minority came to a head
  in December 1963, when violence broke out in the capital of Nicosia.
  Despite the deployment of UN peacekeepers in 1964, sporadic
  intercommunal violence continued forcing most Turkish Cypriots into
  enclaves throughout the island. In 1974, a Greek
  Government-sponsored attempt to seize control of Cyprus was met by
  military intervention from Turkey, which soon controlled more than a
  third of the island. In 1983, the Turkish-held area declared itself
  the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," but it is recognized only
  by Turkey. The latest two-year round of UN-brokered talks - between
  the leaders of the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities to
  reach an agreement to reunite the divided island - ended when the
  Greek Cypriots rejected the UN settlement plan in an April 2004
  referendum. The entire island entered the EU on 1 May 2004, although
  the EU acquis - the body of common rights and obligations - applies
  only to the areas under direct Republic of Cyprus control, and is
  suspended in the areas administered by Turkish Cypriots. However,
  individual Turkish Cypriots able to document their eligibility for
  Republic of Cyprus citizenship legally enjoy the same rights
  accorded to other citizens of European Union states. Nicosia
  continues to oppose EU efforts to establish direct trade and
  economic links to north Cyprus as a way of encouraging the Turkish
  Cypriot community to continue to support reunification.

Economy Cyprus


Economy - overview:
  The Republic of Cyprus has a market economy dominated by the
  service sector, which accounts for 76% of GDP. Tourism and financial
  services are the most important sectors; erratic growth rates over
  the past decade reflect the economy's reliance on tourism, which
  often fluctuates with political instability in the region and
  economic conditions in Western Europe. Nevertheless, the economy
  grew a healthy 3.7% per year in 2004 and 2005, well above the EU
  average. Cyprus joined the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM2)
  in May 2005. The government has initiated an aggressive austerity
  program, which has cut the budget deficit to below 3% but continued
  fiscal discipline is necessary if Cyprus is to meet its goal of
  adopting the euro on 1 January 2008. As in the area administered by
  Turkish Cypriots, water shortages are a perennial problem; a few
  desalination plants are now on line. After 10 years of drought, the
  country received substantial rainfall from 2001-03 alleviating
  immediate concerns. The Turkish Cypriot economy has roughly
  one-third of the per capita GDP of the south, and economic growth
  tends to be volatile, given north Cyprus's relative isolation,
  bloated public sector, reliance on the Turkish lira, and small
  market size. The Turkish Cypriot economy grew 15.4% in 2004, fueled
  by growth in the construction and education sectors, as well as
  increased employment of Turkish Cypriots in the Republic of Cyprus.
  The Turkish Cypriots are heavily dependent on transfers from the
  Turkish Government. Under the 2003-06 economic protocol, Ankara
  planned to provide around $700 million to the "TRNC." Agriculture
  and services, together, employ more than half of the work force.

GDP (purchasing power parity):
  Republic of Cyprus: $17.79 billion; north Cyprus: $4.54 billion
  (2006 est.)

GDP (official exchange rate):
  Republic of Cyprus: $16.35 billion (2006 est.)

GDP - per capita (PPP):
  Republic of Cyprus: $22,700 (2005 est.); north Cyprus: $7,135 (2004
  est.) (2006 est.)

GDP - composition by sector:
  Republic of Cyprus: agriculture 3.7%; industry 19.6%; services
  76.8% (2005 est.)
  north Cyprus: agriculture 10.6%; industry 20.5%; services 68.9%
  (2003 est.)

Labor force:
  Republic of Cyprus: 380,000, north Cyprus: 95,025 (2006 est.)

Transnational Issues Cyprus


Disputes - international:
  hostilities in 1974 divided the island into two de facto autonomous
  entities, the internationally recognized Cypriot Government and a
  Turkish-Cypriot community (north Cyprus); the 1,000-strong UN
  Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) has served in Cyprus since
  1964 and maintains the buffer zone between north and south; March
  2003 reunification talks failed, but Turkish-Cypriots later opened
  their borders to temporary visits by Greek Cypriots; on 24 April
  2004, the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities voted in
  simultaneous and parallel referenda on whether to approve the
  UN-brokered Annan Plan that would have ended the 30-year division of
  the island by establishing a new "United Cyprus Republic," a
  majority of Greek Cypriots voted "no"; on 1 May 2004, Cyprus entered
  the European Union still divided, with the EU's body of legislation
  and standards (acquis communitaire) suspended in the north

Refugees and internally displaced persons:
  IDPs: 210,000 (both Turkish and Greek Cypriots; many displaced for
  over 30 years) (2006)

Trafficking in persons:
  current situation: Cyprus is primarily a destination country for a
  large number of women trafficked from Eastern and Central Europe,
  the Philippines, and the Dominican Republic for the purpose of
  sexual exploitation; traffickers continued to fraudulently recruit
  victims for work as dancers in cabarets and nightclubs on short-term
  "artiste" visas, for work in pubs and bars on employment visas, or
  for illegal work on tourist or student visas; there were credible
  reports of female domestic workers from India, Sri Lanka, and the
  Philippines forced to work excessively long hours and denied proper
  compensation
  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Cyprus does not fully comply with
  the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and failed
  to show evidence of increasing efforts to address its serious
  trafficking for sexual exploitation problem; however, it is making
  significant efforts to do so

Illicit drugs:
  minor transit point for heroin and hashish via air routes and
  container traffic to Europe, especially from Lebanon and Turkey;
  some cocaine transits as well; despite a strengthening of
  anti-money-laundering legislation, remains vulnerable to money
  laundering; reporting of suspicious transactions in offshore sector
  remains weak

@Czech Republic

Introduction Czech Republic


Background:
  Following the First World War, the closely related Czechs and
  Slovaks of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire merged to form
  Czechoslovakia. During the interwar years, the new country's leaders
  were frequently preoccupied with meeting the demands of other ethnic
  minorities within the republic, most notably the Sudeten Germans and
  the Ruthenians (Ukrainians). After World War II, a truncated
  Czechoslovakia fell within the Soviet sphere of influence. In 1968,
  an invasion by Warsaw Pact troops ended the efforts of the country's
  leaders to liberalize Communist party rule and create "socialism
  with a human face." Anti-Soviet demonstrations the following year
  ushered in a period of harsh repression. With the collapse of Soviet
  authority in 1989, Czechoslovakia regained its freedom through a
  peaceful "Velvet Revolution." On 1 January 1993, the country
  underwent a "velvet divorce" into its two national components, the
  Czech Republic and Slovakia. The Czech Republic joined NATO in 1999
  and the European Union in 2004.

Economy Czech Republic


Economy - overview:
  The Czech Republic is one of the most stable and prosperous of the
  post-Communist states of Central and Eastern Europe. Growth in
  2000-05 was supported by exports to the EU, primarily to Germany,
  and a strong recovery of foreign and domestic investment. Domestic
  demand is playing an ever more important role in underpinning growth
  as interest rates drop and the availability of credit cards and
  mortgages increases. The current account deficit has declined to
  around 3% of GDP as demand for Czech products in the European Union
  has increased. Inflation is under control. Recent accession to the
  EU gives further impetus and direction to structural reform. In
  early 2004 the government passed increases in the Value Added Tax
  (VAT) and tightened eligibility for social benefits with the
  intention to bring the public finance gap down to 4% of GDP by 2006,
  but more difficult pension and healthcare reforms will have to wait
  until after the next elections. Privatization of the state-owned
  telecommunications firm Cesky Telecom took place in 2005.
  Intensified restructuring among large enterprises, improvements in
  the financial sector, and effective use of available EU funds should
  strengthen output growth.

Introduction Denmark


Background:
  Once the seat of Viking raiders and later a major north European
  power, Denmark has evolved into a modern, prosperous nation that is
  participating in the general political and economic integration of
  Europe. It joined NATO in 1949 and the EEC (now the EU) in 1973.
  However, the country has opted out of certain elements of the
  European Union's Maastricht Treaty, including the European Economic
  and Monetary Union (EMU), European defense cooperation, and issues
  concerning certain justice and home affairs.

Economy Denmark


Economy - overview:
  The Danish economy is undergoing strong expansion fueled by private
  consumption growth, low unemployment, rising real wages, and a
  strong increase in house prices. This thoroughly modern market
  economy features high-tech agriculture, up-to-date small-scale and
  corporate industry, extensive government welfare measures,
  comfortable living standards, a stable currency, and high dependence
  on foreign trade. Denmark is a net exporter of food and energy and
  enjoys a comfortable balance of payments surplus. Government
  objectives include streamlining the bureaucracy and further
  privatization of state assets. The government has been successful in
  meeting, and even exceeding, the economic convergence criteria for
  participating in the third phase (a common European currency) of the
  European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), but Denmark has decided
  not to join 12 other EU members in the euro. Nonetheless, the Danish
  krone remains pegged to the euro. Economic growth gained momentum in
  2004 and the upturn continued through 2006. Because of high GDP per
  capita, welfare benefits, a low Gini index, and political stability,
  the Danish people enjoy living standards topped by no other nation.
  A major long-term issue will be the sharp decline in the ratio of
  workers to retirees.

@Djibouti

Introduction Djibouti


Background:
  The French Territory of the Afars and the Issas became Djibouti in
  1977. Hassan Gouled APTIDON installed an authoritarian one-party
  state and proceeded to serve as president until 1999. Unrest among
  the Afars minority during the 1990s led to a civil war that ended in
  2001 following the conclusion of a peace accord between Afar rebels
  and the Issa-dominated government. In 1999, Djibouti's first
  multi-party presidential elections resulted in the election of
  Ismail Omar GUELLEH; he was re-elected to a second and final term in
  2005. Djibouti occupies a strategic geographic location at the mouth
  of the Red Sea and serves as an important transshipment location for
  goods entering and leaving the east African highlands. The present
  leadership favors close ties to France, which maintains a
  significant military presence in the country, but is also developing
  stronger ties with the US. Djibouti hosts the only US military base
  in sub-Saharan Africa and is a front-line state in the global war on
  terrorism.

Economy Djibouti


Economy - overview:
  The economy is based on service activities connected with the
  country's strategic location and status as a free trade zone in
  northeast Africa. Two-thirds of the inhabitants live in the capital
  city; the remainder are mostly nomadic herders. Scanty rainfall
  limits crop production to fruits and vegetables, and most food must
  be imported. Djibouti provides services as both a transit port for
  the region and an international transshipment and refueling center.
  Djibouti has few natural resources and little industry. The nation
  is, therefore, heavily dependent on foreign assistance to help
  support its balance of payments and to finance development projects.
  An unemployment rate of at least 50% continues to be a major
  problem. While inflation is not a concern, due to the fixed tie of
  the Djiboutian franc to the US dollar, the artificially high value
  of the Djiboutian franc adversely affects Djibouti's balance of
  payments. Per capita consumption dropped an estimated 35% over the
  last seven years because of recession, civil war, and a high
  population growth rate (including immigrants and refugees). Faced
  with a multitude of economic difficulties, the government has fallen
  in arrears on long-term external debt and has been struggling to
  meet the stipulations of foreign aid donors.

  exploitation and possibly forced labor; small numbers are trafficked
  from Ethiopia and Somalia for sexual exploitation; economic migrants
  from these countries also fall victim to trafficking upon reaching
  Djibouti City or the Ethiopia-Djibouti trucking corridor; women and
  children from neighboring countries reportedly transit Djibouti to
  Arab countries and Somalia for ultimate use in forced labor or
  sexual exploitation
  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Djibouti does not fully comply with
  the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however,
  it is making significant efforts to do so based partly on the
  government's commitments to undertake future action

@Dominica

Introduction Dominica


Background:
  Dominica was the last of the Caribbean islands to be colonized by
  Europeans due chiefly to the fierce resistance of the native Caribs.
  France ceded possession to Great Britain in 1763, which made the
  island a colony in 1805. In 1980, two years after independence,
  Dominica's fortunes improved when a corrupt and tyrannical
  administration was replaced by that of Mary Eugenia CHARLES, the
  first female prime minister in the Caribbean, who remained in office
  for 15 years. Some 3,000 Carib Indians still living on Dominica are
  the only pre-Columbian population remaining in the eastern Caribbean.

Economy Dominica


Economy - overview:
  The Dominican economy depends on agriculture, primarily bananas,
  and remains highly vulnerable to climatic conditions and
  international economic developments. Tourism has increased as the
  government seeks to promote Dominica as an "ecotourism" destination.
  Development of the tourism industry remains difficult, however,
  because of the rugged coastline, lack of beaches, and the absence of
  an international airport. The government began a comprehensive
  restructuring of the economy in 2003 - including elimination of
  price controls, privatization of the state banana company, and tax
  increases - to address Dominica's economic crisis and to meet IMF
  targets. In order to diversify the island's production base, the
  government is attempting to develop an offshore financial sector and
  is planning to construct an oil refinery on the eastern part of the
  island.

Transnational Issues Dominica


Disputes - international:
  Dominica is the only Caribbean state to challenge Venezuela's
  sovereignty claim over Aves Island and joins the other island
  nations in challenging whether the feature sustains human
  habitation, a criterion under the UN Convention on the Law of the
  Sea (UNCLOS), which permits Venezuela to extend its Exclusive
  Economic Zone (EEZ) and continental shelf claims over a large
  portion of the Caribbean Sea

Illicit drugs:
  transshipment point for narcotics bound for the US and Europe;
  minor cannabis producer; anti-money-laundering enforcement is weak,
  making the country particularly vulnerable to money laundering

@Dominican Republic

Introduction Dominican Republic


Background:
  Explored and claimed by Christopher COLUMBUS on his first voyage in
  1492, the island of Hispaniola became a springboard for Spanish
  conquest of the Caribbean and the American mainland. In 1697, Spain
  recognized French dominion over the western third of the island,
  which in 1804 became Haiti. The remainder of the island, by then
  known as Santo Domingo, sought to gain its own independence in 1821,
  but was conquered and ruled by the Haitians for 22 years; it finally
  attained independence as the Dominican Republic in 1844. In 1861,
  the Dominicans voluntarily returned to the Spanish Empire, but two
  years later they launched a war that restored independence in 1865.
  A legacy of unsettled, mostly non-representative rule followed,
  capped by the dictatorship of Rafael Leonidas TRUJILLO from
  1930-1961. Juan BOSCH was elected president in 1962, but was deposed
  in a military coup in 1963. In 1965, the United States led an
  intervention in the midst of a civil war sparked by an uprising to
  restore BOSCH. In 1966, Joaquin BALAGUER defeated BOSCH in an
  election to become president. BALAGUER maintained a tight grip on
  power for most of the next 30 years when international reaction to
  flawed elections forced him to curtail his term in 1996. Since then,
  regular competitive elections have been held in which opposition
  candidates have won the presidency. Former President (1996-2000)
  Leonel FERNANDEZ Reyna won election to a second term in 2004
  following a constitutional amendment allowing presidents to serve
  more than one term.

Economy Dominican Republic


Economy - overview:
  The Dominican Republic is a Caribbean representative democracy that
  enjoyed strong GDP growth until 2003. Although the country has long
  been viewed primarily as an exporter of sugar, coffee, and tobacco,
  in recent years the service sector has overtaken agriculture as the
  economy's largest employer due to growth in tourism and free trade
  zones. Growth turned negative in 2003 with reduced tourism, a major
  bank fraud, and limited growth in the US economy (the source of
  about 80% of export revenues), but recovered in 2004-06. With the
  help of strict fiscal targets agreed in the 2004 renegotiation of an
  IMF standby loan, President FERNANDEZ has stabilized the country's
  financial situation. Although the economy continues to grow at a
  respectable rate, high unemployment and inflation remain important
  challenges. The country suffers from marked income inequality; the
  poorest half of the population receives less than one-fifth of GNP,
  while the richest 10% enjoys nearly 40% of national income. The
  Dominican Republic's development prospects improved with the
  ratification of the Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade
  Agreement (CAFTA-DR) in September 2005.

@East Timor

Introduction East Timor


Background:
  The Portuguese began to trade with the island of Timor in the early
  16th century and colonized it in mid-century. Skirmishing with the
  Dutch in the region eventually resulted in an 1859 treaty in which
  Portugal ceded the western portion of the island. Imperial Japan
  occupied East Timor from 1942 to 1945, but Portugal resumed colonial
  authority after the Japanese defeat in World War II. East Timor
  declared itself independent from Portugal on 28 November 1975 and
  was invaded and occupied by Indonesian forces nine days later. It
  was incorporated into Indonesia in July 1976 as the province of East
  Timor. An unsuccessful campaign of pacification followed over the
  next two decades, during which an estimated 100,000 to 250,000
  individuals lost their lives. On 30 August 1999, in a UN-supervised
  popular referendum, an overwhelming majority of the people of East
  Timor voted for independence from Indonesia. Between the referendum
  and the arrival of a multinational peacekeeping force in late
  September 1999, anti-independence Timorese militias - organized and
  supported by the Indonesian military - commenced a large-scale,
  scorched-earth campaign of retribution. The militias killed
  approximately 1,400 Timorese and forcibly pushed 300,000 people into
  West Timor as refugees. The majority of the country's
  infrastructure, including homes, irrigation systems, water supply
  systems, and schools, and nearly 100% of the country's electrical
  grid were destroyed. On 20 September 1999 the Australian-led
  peacekeeping troops of the International Force for East Timor
  (INTERFET) deployed to the country and brought the violence to an
  end. On 20 May 2002, East Timor was internationally recognized as an
  independent state. In March of 2006, a military strike led to
  violence and a near breakdown of law and order. Over 2,000
  Australian, New Zealand, and Portuguese police and peacekeepers
  deployed to East Timor in late May. Although many of the
  peacekeepers were replaced by UN police officers, 850 Australian
  soldiers remained as of 1 January 2007.

Economy East Timor


Economy - overview:
  In late 1999, about 70% of the economic infrastructure of East
  Timor was laid waste by Indonesian troops and anti-independence
  militias, and 300,000 people fled westward. Over the next three
  years, however, a massive international program, manned by 5,000
  peacekeepers (8,000 at peak) and 1,300 police officers, led to
  substantial reconstruction in both urban and rural areas. By the end
  of 2005, all refugees either returned or resettled in Indonesia. The
  country faces great challenges in continuing the rebuilding of
  infrastructure, strengthening the infant civil administration, and
  generating jobs for young people entering the work force. The
  development of oil and gas resources in nearby waters has begun to
  supplement government revenues ahead of schedule and above
  expectations - the result of high petroleum prices - but the
  technology-intensive industry does little to create jobs for the
  unemployed, because there are no production facilities in Timor and
  the gas is piped to Australia. The parliament in June 2005
  unanimously approved the creation of a Petroleum Fund to serve as a
  repository for all petroleum revenues and preserve the value of East
  Timor's petroleum wealth for future generations.

Introduction Ecuador


Background:
  What is now Ecuador formed part of the northern Inca Empire until
  the Spanish conquest in 1533. Quito became a seat of Spanish
  colonial government in 1563 and part of the Viceroyalty of New
  Granada in 1717. The territories of the Viceroyalty - New Granada
  (Colombia), Venezuela, and Quito - gained their independence by 1819
  and formed a federation known as Gran Colombia. When Quito withdrew
  in 1830, the traditional name was changed in favor of the "Republic
  of the Equator." Between 1904 and 1942, Ecuador lost territories in
  a series of conflicts with its neighbors. A border war with Peru
  that flared in 1995 was resolved in 1999. Although Ecuador marked 25
  years of civilian governance in 2004, the period has been marred by
  political instability. Protests in Quito have contributed to the
  mid-term ouster of Ecuador's last three democratically elected
  Presidents.

Economy Ecuador


Economy - overview:
  Ecuador has substantial petroleum resources, which have accounted
  for 40% of the country's export earnings and one-third of central
  government budget revenues in recent years. Consequently,
  fluctuations in world market prices can have a substantial domestic
  impact. In the late 1990s, Ecuador suffered its worst economic
  crisis, with natural disasters and sharp declines in world petroleum
  prices driving Ecuador's economy into free fall in 1999. Real GDP
  contracted by more than 6%, with poverty worsening significantly.
  The banking system also collapsed, and Ecuador defaulted on its
  external debt later that year. The currency depreciated by some 70%
  in 1999, and, on the brink of hyperinflation, the MAHAUD government
  announced it would dollarize the economy. A coup, however, ousted
  MAHAUD from office in January 2000, and after a short-lived junta
  failed to garner military support, Vice President Gustavo NOBOA took
  over the presidency. In March 2000, Congress approved a series of
  structural reforms that also provided the framework for the adoption
  of the US dollar as legal tender. Dollarization stabilized the
  economy, and growth returned to its pre-crisis levels in the years
  that followed. Under the administration of Lucio GUTIERREZ - January
  2003 to April 2005 - Ecuador benefited from higher world petroleum
  prices. However, the government under Alfredo PALACIO has reversed
  economic reforms that reduced Ecuador's vulnerability to petroleum
  price swings and financial crises, allowing the central government
  greater access to oil windfalls and disbursing surplus retirement
  funds.

@Egypt

Introduction Egypt


Background:
  The regularity and richness of the annual Nile River flood, coupled
  with semi-isolation provided by deserts to the east and west,
  allowed for the development of one of the world's great
  civilizations. A unified kingdom arose circa 3200 B.C., and a series
  of dynasties ruled in Egypt for the next three millennia. The last
  native dynasty fell to the Persians in 341 B.C., who in turn were
  replaced by the Greeks, Romans, and Byzantines. It was the Arabs who
  introduced Islam and the Arabic language in the 7th century and who
  ruled for the next six centuries. A local military caste, the
  Mamluks took control about 1250 and continued to govern after the
  conquest of Egypt by the Ottoman Turks in 1517. Following the
  completion of the Suez Canal in 1869, Egypt became an important
  world transportation hub, but also fell heavily into debt.
  Ostensibly to protect its investments, Britain seized control of
  Egypt's government in 1882, but nominal allegiance to the Ottoman
  Empire continued until 1914. Partially independent from the UK in
  1922, Egypt acquired full sovereignty following World War II. The
  completion of the Aswan High Dam in 1971 and the resultant Lake
  Nasser have altered the time-honored place of the Nile River in the
  agriculture and ecology of Egypt. A rapidly growing population (the
  largest in the Arab world), limited arable land, and dependence on
  the Nile all continue to overtax resources and stress society. The
  government has struggled to ready the economy for the new millennium
  through economic reform and massive investment in communications and
  physical infrastructure.

Economy Egypt


Economy - overview:
  Occupying the northeast corner of the African continent, Egypt is
  bisected by the highly fertile Nile valley, where most economic
  activity takes place. In the last 30 years, the government has
  reformed the highly centralized economy it inherited from President
  NASSER. In 2005, Prime Minister Ahmed NAZIF reduced personal and
  corporate tax rates, reduced energy subsidies, and privatized
  several enterprises. The stock market boomed, and GDP grew about 5%
  per year in 2005-06. Despite these achievements, the government has
  failed to raise living standards for the average Egyptian, and has
  had to continue providing subsidies for basic necessities. The
  subsidies have contributed to a growing budget deficit - more than
  10% of GDP each year - and represent a significant drain on the
  economy. Foreign direct investment remains low. To achieve higher
  GDP growth the NAZIF government will need to continue its aggressive
  pursuit of reform, especially in the energy sector. Egypt's export
  sectors - particularly natural gas - have bright prospects.

  the attack on Taba and other Egyptian resort towns on the Red Sea in
  October 2004, Egypt vigilantly monitors the Sinai and borders with
  Israel and the Gaza Strip; Egypt does not extend domestic asylum to
  some 70,000 persons who identify themselves as Palestinians but who
  largely lack UNRWA assistance and, until recently, UNHCR recognition
  as refugees

  Territories), 13,446 (Sudan) (2006)

Trafficking in persons:

  from Eastern Europe to Israel for the purpose of sexual
  exploitation; these women generally arrive as tourists and are
  subsequently trafficked through the Sinai Desert by Bedouin tribes;
  men and women from sub-Saharan Africa and Asia are believed to be
  trafficked through the Sinai Desert to Israel and Europe for labor
  exploitation; some Egyptian children from rural areas are trafficked
  within the country to work as domestic servants or laborers in the
  agriculture industry
  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Egypt is placed on the Tier 2 Watch
  List for its failure to show evidence of increasing efforts to
  address trafficking over the past year, particularly in the area of
  law enforcement

Illicit drugs:
  transit point for Southwest Asian and Southeast Asian heroin and
  opium moving to Europe, Africa, and the US; transit stop for
  Nigerian couriers; concern as money-laundering site due to lax
  enforcement of financial regulations

Economy El Salvador


Economy - overview:
  The smallest country in Central America, El Salvador has the third
  largest economy, but growth has been minimal in recent years. Hoping
  to stimulate the sluggish economy, the government is striving to
  open new export markets, encourage foreign investment, and modernize
  the tax and healthcare systems. Implementation in 2006 of the
  Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement, which El
  Salvador was the first to ratify, has strenthened an already
  positive export trend. The trade deficit has been offset by annual
  remittances from Salvadorans living abroad - equivalent to more than
  15% of GDP - and external aid. With the adoption of the US dollar as
  its currency in 2001, El Salvador has lost control over monetary
  policy and must concentrate on maintaining a disciplined fiscal
  policy. The current government has pursued economic diversification,
  with some success in promoting textile production, international
  port services, and tourism. It is committed to opening the economy
  to trade and investment, and has embarked on a wave of
  privatizations extending to telecom, electricity distribution,
  banking, and pension funds.

@Equatorial Guinea

Introduction Equatorial Guinea


Background:
  Equatorial Guinea gained independence in 1968 after 190 years of
  Spanish rule. This tiny country, composed of a mainland portion plus
  five inhabited islands, is one of the smallest on the African
  continent. President Teodoro OBIANG NGUEMA MBASOGO has ruled the
  country since 1979 when he seized power in a coup. Although
  nominally a constitutional democracy since 1991, the 1996 and 2002
  presidential elections - as well as the 1999 and 2004 legislative
  elections - were widely seen as flawed. The president exerts almost
  total control over the political system and has discouraged
  political opposition. Equatorial Guinea has experienced rapid
  economic growth due to the discovery of large offshore oil reserves,
  and in the last decade has become Sub-Saharan Africa's third largest
  oil exporter. Despite the country's economic windfall from oil
  production resulting in a massive increase in government revenue in
  recent years, there have been few improvements in the population's
  living standards.

Economy Equatorial Guinea


Economy - overview:
  The discovery and exploitation of large oil reserves have
  contributed to dramatic economic growth in recent years. Forestry,
  farming, and fishing are also major components of GDP. Subsistence
  farming predominates. Although pre-independence Equatorial Guinea
  counted on cocoa production for hard currency earnings, the neglect
  of the rural economy under successive regimes has diminished
  potential for agriculture-led growth (the government has stated its
  intention to reinvest some oil revenue into agriculture). A number
  of aid programs sponsored by the World Bank and the IMF have been
  cut off since 1993, because of corruption and mismanagement. No
  longer eligible for concessional financing because of large oil
  revenues, the government has been trying to agree on a "shadow"
  fiscal management program with the World Bank and IMF. Businesses,
  for the most part, are owned by government officials and their
  family members. Undeveloped natural resources include titanium, iron
  ore, manganese, uranium, and alluvial gold. Growth remained strong
  in 2006, led by oil. Equatorial Guinea now has the third highest per
  capita income in the world, after Luxembourg and Bermuda.

Transnational Issues Equatorial Guinea


Disputes - international:
  in 2002, ICJ ruled on an equidistance settlement of
  Cameroon-Equatorial Guinea-Nigeria maritime boundary in the Gulf of
  Guinea, but a dispute between Equatorial Guinea and Cameroon over an
  island at the mouth of the Ntem River, imprecisely defined maritime
  coordinates in the ICJ decision, and the unresolved Bakasi
  allocation contribute to the delay in implementation; UN has been
  pressing Equatorial Guinea and Gabon to pledge to resolve the
  sovereignty dispute over Gabon-occupied Mbane Island and create a
  maritime boundary in the hydrocarbon-rich Corisco Bay

Trafficking in persons:
  current situation: Equatorial Guinea is a transit and destination
  country for women and children trafficked for forced labor,
  involuntary domestic servitude, and commercial sexual exploitation
  from surrounding countries - primarily Benin, Nigeria, Mali, and
  Cameroon; victims work in the agricultural and commercial sectors of
  Malabo and Bata, where demand is high due to a booming oil sector;
  children work as farmhands, street vendors, or household servants;
  girls and women are also trafficked for commercial sexual
  exploitation
  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Equatorial Guinea is placed on the
  Tier 2 Watch List for its failure to provide adequate evidence of
  concrete measures to address trafficking over the past year

@Eritrea

Introduction Eritrea


Background:
  Eritrea was awarded to Ethiopia in 1952 as part of a federation.
  Ethiopia's annexation of Eritrea as a province 10 years later
  sparked a 30-year struggle for independence that ended in 1991 with
  Eritrean rebels defeating governmental forces; independence was
  overwhelmingly approved in a 1993 referendum. A two-and-a-half-year
  border war with Ethiopia that erupted in 1998 ended under UN
  auspices in December 2000. Eritrea currently hosts a UN peacekeeping
  operation that is monitoring a 25 km-wide Temporary Security Zone on
  the border with Ethiopia. An international commission, organized to
  resolve the border dispute, posted its findings in 2002 but final
  demarcation is on hold due to Ethiopian objections.

Economy Eritrea


Economy - overview:
  Since independence from Ethiopia in 1993, Eritrea has faced the
  economic problems of a small, desperately poor country. Like the
  economies of many African nations, the economy is largely based on
  subsistence agriculture, with 80% of the population involved in
  farming and herding. The Ethiopian-Eritrea war in 1998-2000 severely
  hurt Eritrea's economy. GDP growth fell to zero in 1999 and to
  -12.1% in 2000. The May 2000 Ethiopian offensive into northern
  Eritrea caused some $600 million in property damage and loss,
  including losses of $225 million in livestock and 55,000 homes. The
  attack prevented planting of crops in Eritrea's most productive
  region, causing food production to drop by 62%. Even during the war,
  Eritrea developed its transportation infrastructure, asphalting new
  roads, improving its ports, and repairing war-damaged roads and
  bridges. Since the war ended, the government has maintained a firm
  grip on the economy, expanding the use of the military and
  party-owned businesses to complete Eritrea's development agenda.
  Erratic rainfall and the delayed demobilization of agriculturalists
  from the military kept cereal production well below normal, holding
  down growth in 2002-06. Eritrea's economic future depends upon its
  ability to master social problems such as illiteracy, unemployment,
  and low skills, as well as the willingness to open its economy to
  private enterprise so that the diaspora's money and expertise can
  foster economic growth.

  without modifications; in 2005 Eritrea began severely restricting
  the operations of the UN Peacekeeping Mission to Ethiopia and

Introduction Estonia


Background:
  After centuries of Danish, Swedish, German, and Russian rule,
  Estonia attained independence in 1918. Forcibly incorporated into
  the USSR in 1940 - an action never recognized by the US - it
  regained its freedom in 1991, with the collapse of the Soviet Union.
  Since the last Russian troops left in 1994, Estonia has been free to
  promote economic and political ties with Western Europe. It joined
  both NATO and the EU in the spring of 2004.

  Estonian citizen groups continue to press for realignment of the
  boundary based on the 1920 Tartu Peace Treaty that would bring the
  now divided ethnic Setu people and parts of the Narva region within
  Estonia; as a member state that forms part of the EU's external
  border, Estonia must implement the strict Schengen border rules

Illicit drugs:
  transshipment point for opiates and cannabis from Southwest Asia
  and the Caucasus via Russia, cocaine from Latin America to Western
  Europe and Scandinavia, and synthetic drugs from Western Europe to
  Scandinavia; increasing domestic drug abuse problem; possible
  precursor manufacturing and/or trafficking; potential money
  laundering related to organized crime and drug trafficking is a
  concern, as is possible use of the gambling sector to launder funds

Introduction Ethiopia


Background:
  Unique among African countries, the ancient Ethiopian monarchy
  maintained its freedom from colonial rule with the exception of the
  1936-41 Italian occupation during World War II. In 1974, a military
  junta, the Derg, deposed Emperor Haile SELASSIE (who had ruled since
  1930) and established a socialist state. Torn by bloody coups,
  uprisings, wide-scale drought, and massive refugee problems, the
  regime was finally toppled in 1991 by a coalition of rebel forces,
  the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). A
  constitution was adopted in 1994, and Ethiopia's first multiparty
  elections were held in 1995. A border war with Eritrea late in the
  1990's ended with a peace treaty in December 2000. Final demarcation
  of the boundary is currently on hold due to Ethiopian objections to
  an international commission's finding requiring it to surrender
  territory considered sensitive to Ethiopia.

Economy Ethiopia


Economy - overview:
  Ethiopia's poverty-stricken economy is based on agriculture,
  accounting for half of GDP, 60% of exports, and 80% of total
  employment. The agricultural sector suffers from frequent drought
  and poor cultivation practices. Coffee is critical to the Ethiopian
  economy with exports of some $156 million in 2002, but historically
  low prices have seen many farmers switching to qat to supplement
  income. The war with Eritrea in 1998-2000 and recurrent drought have
  buffeted the economy, in particular coffee production. In November
  2001, Ethiopia qualified for debt relief from the Highly Indebted
  Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, and in December 2005 the
  International Monetary Fund voted to forgive Ethiopia's debt to the
  body. Under Ethiopia's land tenure system, the government owns all
  land and provides long-term leases to the tenants; the system
  continues to hamper growth in the industrial sector as entrepreneurs
  are unable to use land as collateral for loans. Drought struck again
  late in 2002, leading to a 2% decline in GDP in 2003. Normal weather
  patterns helped agricultural and GDP growth recover in 2004-06.

  withdraw to the delimited boundary until technical errors made by
  the EEBC that ignored "human geography" are addressed, including the
  award of Badme, the focus of the 1998-2000 war; Eritrea insists that
  the EEBC decision be implemented immediately without modifications;
  Ethiopia has only an administrative line and no international border
  with the Oromo region of southern Somalia where it maintains
  alliances with local clans in opposition to the unrecognized Somali
  Interim Government in Mogadishu; "Somaliland" secessionists provide
  port facilities and trade ties to landlocked Ethiopia; efforts to
  demarcate the porous boundary with Sudan have been delayed by civil
  war

  ethnic clashes in Gambela; most IDPs are in Tigray and Gambela
  Provinces) (2006)

Illicit drugs:
  transit hub for heroin originating in Southwest and Southeast Asia
  and destined for Europe and North America, as well as cocaine
  destined for markets in southern Africa; cultivates qat (khat) for
  local use and regional export, principally to Djibouti and Somalia
  (legal in all three countries); the lack of a well-developed
  financial system limits the country's utility as a money-laundering
  center

@European Union

Introduction European Union


Preliminary statement:
  The evolution of the European Union (EU) from a regional economic
  agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's
  supranational organization of 27 countries across the European
  continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of
  history. Dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the
  norm in Europe. On a few occasions even country-level unions were
  arranged - the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the
  Austro-Hungarian Empire were examples - but for such a large number
  of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching
  entity is truly unique. Although the EU is not a federation in the
  strict sense, it is far more than a free-trade association such as
  ASEAN, NAFTA, or Mercosur, and it has many of the attributes
  associated with independent nations: its own flag, anthem, founding
  date, and currency, as well as an incipient common foreign and
  security policy in its dealings with other nations. In the future,
  many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded.
  Thus, inclusion of basic intelligence on the EU has been deemed
  appropriate as a new, separate entity in The World Factbook.
  However, because of the EU's special status, this description is
  placed after the regular country entries.

Background:
  Following the two devastating World Wars of the first half of the
  20th century, a number of European leaders in the late 1940s became
  convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to
  unite the two chief belligerent nations - France and Germany - both
  economically and politically. In 1950, the French Foreign Minister
  Robert SCHUMAN proposed an eventual union of all Europe, the first
  step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel
  industries of Western Europe. The following year the European Coal
  and Steel Community (ECSC) was set up when six members, Belgium,
  France, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, signed
  the Treaty of Paris. The ECSC was so successful that within a few
  years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the
  countries' economies. In 1957, the Treaties of Rome created the
  European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy
  Community (Euratom), and the six member states undertook to
  eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common
  market. In 1967, the institutions of all three communities were
  formally merged into the European Community (EC), creating a single
  Commission, a single Council of Ministers, and the European
  Parliament. Members of the European Parliament were initially
  selected by national parliaments, but in 1979 the first direct
  elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years
  since. In 1973, the first enlargement of the EC took place with the
  addition of Denmark, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. The 1980s saw
  further membership expansion with Greece joining in 1981 and Spain
  and Portugal in 1986. The 1992 Treaty of Maastricht laid the basis
  for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy, in
  judicial and internal affairs, and in the creation of an economic
  and monetary union - including a common currency. This further
  integration created the European Union (EU). In 1995, Austria,
  Finland, and Sweden joined the EU, raising the membership total to
  15. A new currency, the euro, was launched in world money markets on
  1 January 1999; it became the unit of exchange for all of the EU
  states except the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Denmark. In 2002,
  citizens of the 12 euro-area countries began using the euro
  banknotes and coins. Ten new countries joined the EU in 2004 -
  Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania,
  Malta, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia - and in 2007 Bulgaria and
  Romania joined, bringing the current membership to 27. In order to
  ensure that the EU can continue to function efficiently with an
  expanded membership, the Treaty of Nice (in force as of 1 February
  2003) set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of EU
  institutions. An EU Constitutional Treaty, signed in Rome on 29
  October 2004, gave member states two years to ratify the document
  before it was scheduled to take effect on 1 November 2006. Referenda
  held in France and the Netherlands in May-June 2005 rejected the
  proposed constitution. This development set back the ratification
  effort and left the longer-term political integration of the EU in
  limbo.

Economy European Union


Economy - overview:
  Internally, the European Union attempts to lower trade barriers,
  adopt a common currency, and move toward convergence of living
  standards. Internationally, the EU aims to bolster Europe's trade
  position and its political and economic power. Because of the great
  differences in per capita income among member states (from $8,000 to
  $61,000) and historic national animosities, the European Union faces
  difficulties in devising and enforcing common policies. For example,
  since 2003 Germany and France have flouted the member states' treaty
  obligation to prevent their national budgets from running more than
  a 3% deficit. In 2004 and 2007, the EU admitted 10 and two
  countries, respectively, that are, in general, less advanced
  technologically and economically than the other 15. Twelve
  established EU member states introduced the euro as their common
  currency on 1 January 1999, but the UK, Sweden, and Denmark chose
  not to participate. Of the 12 most recent member states, only
  Slovenia has adopted the euro (1 January 2007); the remaining eleven
  are legally required to adopt the currency upon meeting EU's fiscal
  and monetary convergence criteria.

Military European Union


Military - note:
  In November 2004, the European Union heads of government signed a
  "Treaty Establishing a Constitution for Europe" that offers
  possibilities - with some limits - for increased defense and
  security cooperation. If ratified, in a process that may take some
  two years, this treaty will in effect make operational the European
  Security and Defense Policy (ESDP) approved in the 2000 Nice Treaty.
  Despite limits of cooperation for some EU members, development of a
  European military planning unit is likely to continue. So is
  creation of a rapid-reaction military force and a humanitarian aid
  system, which the planning unit will support. France, Germany,
  Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Italy continue to press for
  wider coordination. The five-nation Eurocorps - created in 1992 by
  France, Germany, Belgium, Spain, and Luxembourg - has already
  deployed troops and police on peacekeeping missions to Bosnia and
  Herzegovina, Macedonia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo and
  assumed command of the International Security Assistance Force
  (ISAF) in Afghanistan in August 2004. Eurocorps directly commands
  the 5,000-man Franco-German Brigade, the Multinational Command
  Support Brigade, and EUFOR, which took over from SFOR in Bosnia in
  December 2004. Other troop contributions are under national command
  - commitments to provide 67,100 troops were made at the Helsinki EU
  session in 2000. Some 56,000 EU troops were actually deployed in
  2003. In August 2004, the new European Defense Agency, tasked with
  promoting cooperative European defense capabilities, began
  operations. In November 2004, the EU Council of Ministers formally
  committed to creating thirteen 1,500-man "battle groups" by the end
  of 2007, to respond to international crises on a rotating basis.
  Twenty-two of the EU's 25 nations have agreed to supply troops.
  France, Italy, and the UK are to form the first three battle groups
  in 2005, with Spain to follow. In May 2005, Norway, Sweden, and
  Finland agreed to establish one of the battle groups, possibly to
  include Estonian forces. The remaining groups are to be formed by
  2007. (2005)

Transnational Issues European Union


Disputes - international:
  as a political union, the EU has no border disputes with
  neighboring countries, but Estonia and Latvia have no land boundary
  agreements with Russia, Slovenia disputes its land and maritime
  boundaries with Croatia, and Spain has territorial and maritime
  disputes with Morocco; the EU has set up a Schengen area -
  consisting of 13 EU member states that have signed the convention
  implementing the Schengen agreements (1985 and 1990) on the free
  movement of persons and the harmonization of border controls in
  Europe; the Schengen agreements ("acquis") became incorporated into
  EU law with the implementation of the 1997 Treaty of Amsterdam on 1
  May 1999; member states are: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland,
  France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal,
  Spain, and Sweden; in addition, non-EU states Iceland and Norway (as
  part of the Nordic Union) have been included in the Schengen area
  since 1996 (full members in 2001), bringing the total current
  membership to 15; the UK (since 2000) and Ireland (since 2002) take
  part in some aspects of the Schengen area, especially with respect
  to police and criminal matters; the 12 new member states that joined
  the EU in 2004 and 2007 eventually are expected to participate in
  Schengen, following a transition period to upgrade their border
  controls and procedures

@Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas)

Introduction Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas)


Background:
  Although first sighted by an English navigator in 1592, the first
  landing (English) did not occur until almost a century later in
  1690, and the first settlement (French) was not established until
  1764. The colony was turned over to Spain two years later and the
  islands have since been the subject of a territorial dispute, first
  between Britain and Spain, then between Britain and Argentina. The
  UK asserted its claim to the islands by establishing a naval
  garrison there in 1833. Argentina invaded the islands on 2 April
  1982. The British responded with an expeditionary force that landed
  seven weeks later and after fierce fighting forced Argentine
  surrender on 14 June 1982.

Economy Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas)


Economy - overview:
  The economy was formerly based on agriculture, mainly sheep
  farming, but today fishing contributes the bulk of economic
  activity. In 1987 the government began selling fishing licenses to
  foreign trawlers operating within the Falkland Islands' exclusive
  fishing zone. These license fees total more than $40 million per
  year, which goes to support the island's health, education, and
  welfare system. Squid accounts for 75% of the fish taken. Dairy
  farming supports domestic consumption; crops furnish winter fodder.
  Exports feature shipments of high-grade wool to the UK and the sale
  of postage stamps and coins. The islands are now self-financing
  except for defense. The British Geological Survey announced a
  200-mile oil exploration zone around the islands in 1993, and early
  seismic surveys suggest substantial reserves capable of producing
  500,000 barrels per day; to date, no exploitable site has been
  identified. An agreement between Argentina and the UK in 1995 seeks
  to defuse licensing and sovereignty conflicts that would dampen
  foreign interest in exploiting potential oil reserves. Tourism,
  especially eco-tourism, is increasing rapidly, with about 30,000
  visitors in 2001. Another large source of income is interest paid on
  money the government has in the bank. The British military presence
  also provides a sizeable economic boost.

Economy Faroe Islands


Economy - overview:
  The Faroese economy has had a strong performance since 1994, mostly
  as a result of increasing fish landings and high and stable export
  prices. Unemployment is minimal and there are signs of labor
  shortages in several sectors. The positive economic development has
  helped the Faroese Home Rule Government produce increasing budget
  surpluses, which in turn have helped reduce the large public debt,
  most of it owed to Denmark. However, the total dependence on fishing
  makes the Faroese economy extremely vulnerable, and the present
  fishing efforts appear in excess of what is a sustainable level of
  fishing in the long term. Oil finds close to the Faroese area give
  hope for deposits in the immediate Faroese area, which may
  eventually lay the basis for a more diversified economy and thus
  lessen dependence on Danish economic assistance. Aided by a
  substantial annual subsidy (about 15% of GDP) from Denmark, the
  Faroese have a standard of living not far below the Danes and other
  Scandinavians.

Introduction Fiji


Background:
  Fiji became independent in 1970, after nearly a century as a
  British colony. Democratic rule was interrupted by two military
  coups in 1987, caused by concern over a government perceived as
  dominated by the Indian community (descendants of contract laborers
  brought to the islands by the British in the 19th century). The
  coups and a 1990 constitution that cemented native Melanesian
  control of Fiji, led to heavy Indian emigration; the population loss
  resulted in economic difficulties, but ensured that Melanesians
  became the majority. A new constitution enacted in 1997 was more
  equitable. Free and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted in a
  government led by an Indo-Fijian, but a civilian-led coup in May
  2000 ushered in a prolonged period of political turmoil.
  Parliamentary elections held in August 2001 provided Fiji with a
  democratically elected government led by Prime Minister Laisenia
  QARASE. Re-elected in May 2006, QARASE was ousted in a December 2006
  military coup led by Commodore Voreqe BAINIMARAMA, who initially
  appointed himself acting president. In January 2007, BAINIMARAMA was
  appointed interim prime minister.

Economy Fiji


Economy - overview:
  Fiji, endowed with forest, mineral, and fish resources, is one of
  the most developed of the Pacific island economies, though still
  with a large subsistence sector. Sugar exports, remittances from
  Fijians working abroad, and a growing tourist industry - with
  300,000 to 400,000 tourists annually - are the major sources of
  foreign exchange. Fiji's sugar has special access to European Union
  markets, but will be harmed by the EU's decision to cut sugar
  subsidies. Sugar processing makes up one-third of industrial
  activity but is not efficient. Fiji's tourism industry was damaged
  by the 2006 coup and is facing an uncertain recovery time. Long-term
  problems include low investment, uncertain land ownership rights,
  and the government's ability to manage its budget. Overseas
  remittances from Fijians working in Kuwait and Iraq have increased
  significantly.

Introduction Finland


Background:
  Finland was a province and then a grand duchy under Sweden from the
  12th to the 19th centuries and an autonomous grand duchy of Russia
  after 1809. It won its complete independence in 1917. During World
  War II, it was able to successfully defend its freedom and resist
  invasions by the Soviet Union - albeit with some loss of territory.
  In the subsequent half century, the Finns made a remarkable
  transformation from a farm/forest economy to a diversified modern
  industrial economy; per capita income is now on par with Western
  Europe. A member of the European Union since 1995, Finland was the
  only Nordic state to join the euro system at its initiation in

Economy Finland


Economy - overview:
  Finland has a highly industrialized, largely free-market economy
  with per capita output roughly that of the UK, France, Germany, and
  Italy. Its key economic sector is manufacturing - principally the
  wood, metals, engineering, telecommunications, and electronics
  industries. Trade is important; exports equal two-fifths of GDP.
  Finland excels in high-tech exports, e.g., mobile phones. Except for
  timber and several minerals, Finland depends on imports of raw
  materials, energy, and some components for manufactured goods.
  Because of the climate, agricultural development is limited to
  maintaining self-sufficiency in basic products. Forestry, an
  important export earner, provides a secondary occupation for the
  rural population. High unemployment remains a persistent problem.

Introduction France


Background:
  Although ultimately a victor in World Wars I and II, France
  suffered extensive losses in its empire, wealth, manpower, and rank
  as a dominant nation-state. Nevertheless, France today is one of the
  most modern countries in the world and is a leader among European
  nations. Since 1958, it has constructed a presidential democracy
  resistant to the instabilities experienced in earlier parliamentary
  democracies. In recent years, its reconciliation and cooperation
  with Germany have proved central to the economic integration of
  Europe, including the introduction of a common exchange currency,
  the euro, in January 1999. At present, France is at the forefront of
  efforts to develop the EU's military capabilities to supplement
  progress toward an EU foreign policy.

Economy France


Economy - overview:
  France is in the midst of transition from a well-to-do modern
  economy that has featured extensive government ownership and
  intervention to one that relies more on market mechanisms. The
  government has partially or fully privatized many large companies,
  banks, and insurers. It retains controlling stakes in several
  leading firms, including Air France, France Telecom, Renault, and
  Thales, and is dominant in some sectors, particularly power, public
  transport, and defense industries. The telecommunications sector is
  gradually being opened to competition. France's leaders remain
  committed to a capitalism in which they maintain social equity by
  means of laws, tax policies, and social spending that reduce income
  disparity and the impact of free markets on public health and
  welfare. The government in 2006 focused on introducing measures that
  attempt to boost employment through increased labor market
  flexibility; however, the population has remained opposed to labor
  reforms, hampering the government's ability to revitalize the
  economy. The tax burden remains one of the highest in Europe (nearly
  50% of GDP in 2005). The lingering economic slowdown and inflexible
  budget items probably pushed the budget deficit above the eurozone's
  3%-of-GDP limit in 2006; unemployment hovers near 9%.

Economy French Polynesia


Economy - overview:
  Since 1962, when France stationed military personnel in the region,
  French Polynesia has changed from a subsistence agricultural economy
  to one in which a high proportion of the work force is either
  employed by the military or supports the tourist industry. With the
  halt of French nuclear testing in 1996, the military contribution to
  the economy fell sharply. Tourism accounts for about one-fourth of
  GDP and is a primary source of hard currency earnings. Other sources
  of income are pearl farming and deep-sea commercial fishing. The
  small manufacturing sector primarily processes agricultural
  products. The territory benefits substantially from development
  agreements with France aimed principally at creating new businesses
  and strengthening social services.

@Gabon

Introduction Gabon


Background:
  Only two autocratic presidents have ruled Gabon since independence
  from France in 1960. The current president of Gabon, El Hadj Omar
  BONGO Ondimba - one of the longest-serving heads of state in the
  world - has dominated the country's political scene for almost four
  decades. President BONGO introduced a nominal multiparty system and
  a new constitution in the early 1990s. However, allegations of
  electoral fraud during local elections in 2002-03 and the
  presidential elections in 2005 have exposed the weaknesses of formal
  political structures in Gabon. Gabon's political opposition remains
  weak, divided, and financially dependent on the current regime.
  Despite political conditions, a small population, abundant natural
  resources, and considerable foreign support have helped make Gabon
  one of the more prosperous and stable African countries.

Economy Gabon


Economy - overview:
  Gabon enjoys a per capita income four times that of most of
  sub-Saharan African nations. This has supported a sharp decline in
  extreme poverty; yet, because of high income inequality, a large
  proportion of the population remains poor. Gabon depended on timber
  and manganese until oil was discovered offshore in the early 1970s.
  The oil sector now accounts for 50% of GDP. Gabon continues to face
  fluctuating prices for its oil, timber, and manganese exports.
  Despite the abundance of natural wealth, poor fiscal management
  hobbles the economy. Devaluation of its currency by 50% in January
  1994 sparked a one-time inflationary surge, to 35%; the rate dropped
  to 6% in 1996. The IMF provided a one-year standby arrangement in
  1994-95, a three-year Enhanced Financing Facility (EFF) at near
  commercial rates beginning in late 1995, and stand-by credit of $119
  million in October 2000. Those agreements mandated progress in
  privatization and fiscal discipline. France provided additional
  financial support in January 1997 after Gabon met IMF targets for
  mid-1996. In 1997, an IMF mission to Gabon criticized the government
  for overspending on off-budget items, overborrowing from the central
  bank, and slipping on its schedule for privatization and
  administrative reform. The rebound of oil prices in 1999-2000 helped
  growth, but drops in production hampered Gabon from fully realizing
  potential gains. In December 2000, Gabon signed a new agreement with
  the Paris Club to reschedule its official debt. A follow-up
  bilateral repayment agreement with the US was signed in December
  2001. Gabon signed a 14-month Stand-By Arrangement with the IMF in
  May 2004, and received Paris Club debt rescheduling later that year.
  Short-term progress depends on an upbeat world economy and fiscal
  and other adjustments in line with IMF policies.

Introduction Gambia, The


Background:
  The Gambia gained its independence from the UK in 1965.
  Geographically surrounded by Senegal, it formed a short-lived
  federation of Senegambia between 1982 and 1989. In 1991 the two
  nations signed a friendship and cooperation treaty, but tensions
  have flared up intermittently since then. Yahya A. J. J. JAMMEH led
  a military coup in 1994 that overthrew the president and banned
  political activity. A new constitution and presidential elections in
  1996, followed by parliamentary balloting in 1997, completed a
  nominal return to civilian rule. JAMMEH has been elected president
  in all subsequent elections, including most recently in late 2006.

Economy Gambia, The


Economy - overview:
  The Gambia has no confirmed mineral or natural resource deposits
  and has a limited agricultural base. About 75% of the population
  depends on crops and livestock for its livelihood. Small-scale
  manufacturing activity features the processing of peanuts, fish, and
  hides. Reexport trade normally constitutes a major segment of
  economic activity, but a 1999 government-imposed preshipment
  inspection plan, and instability of the Gambian dalasi (currency)
  have drawn some of the reexport trade away from The Gambia. The
  Gambia's natural beauty and proximity to Europe has made it one of
  the larger markets for tourism in West Africa. The government's 1998
  seizure of the private peanut firm Alimenta eliminated the largest
  purchaser of Gambian groundnuts. Despite an announced program to
  begin privatizing key parastatals, no plans have been made public
  that would indicate that the government intends to follow through on
  its promises. Unemployment and underemployment rates remain
  extremely high; short-run economic progress depends on sustained
  bilateral and multilateral aid, on responsible government economic
  management, on continued technical assistance from the IMF and
  bilateral donors, and on expected growth in the construction sector.

@Gaza Strip



Background:
  The Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government
  Arrangements (the DOP), signed in Washington in September 1993,
  provided for a transitional period of Palestinian interim
  self-government in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. A transfer of
  authority to the Palestinian Authority (PA) for the Gaza Strip and
  Jericho took place pursuant to the Israel-PLO 4 May 1994 Cairo
  Agreement on the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area and, in additional
  areas of the West Bank, pursuant to the Israel-PLO 28 September 1995
  Interim Agreement, the Israel-PLO 15 January 1997 Protocol
  Concerning Redeployment in Hebron, the Israel-PLO 23 October 1998
  Wye River Memorandum, and the 4 September 1999 Sharm el-Sheikh
  Agreement. Direct negotiations to determine the permanent status of
  Gaza and the West Bank began in September 1999 after a three-year
  hiatus, but were derailed by a second intifadah that broke out a
  year later. In April 2003, the Quartet (US, EU, UN, and Russia)
  presented a roadmap to a final settlement of the conflict by 2005
  based on reciprocal steps by the two parties leading to two states,
  Israel and a democratic Palestine. The proposed date for a permanent
  status agreement has been postponed indefinitely due to violence and
  accusations that both sides have not followed through on their
  commitments. Following Palestinian leader Yasir ARAFAT's death in
  late 2004, Mahmud ABBAS was elected PA president in January 2005. A
  month later, Israel and the PA agreed to the Sharm el-Sheikh
  Commitments in an effort to move the peace process forward. In
  September 2005, Israel withdrew all its settlers and soldiers and
  dismantled its military facilities in the Gaza Strip and four
  northern West Bank settlements. Nonetheless, Israel controls
  maritime, airspace, and most access to the Gaza Strip. A November
  2005 PA-Israeli agreement authorized the reopening of the Rafah
  border crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt under joint PA and
  Egyptian control. In January 2006, the Islamic Resistance Movement,
  HAMAS, won control of the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC). The
  international community has refused to accept the HAMAS-led
  government because it does not recognize Israel, will not renounce
  violence, and refuses to honor previous peace agreements between
  Israel and the PA. Since March 2006, President Abbas has had little
  success negotiating with HAMAS to present a political platform
  acceptable to the international community so as to lift the economic
  siege on Palestinians. The PLC was unable to convene in late 2006 as
  a result of Israel's detention of many HAMAS PLC members and
  Israeli-imposed travel restrictions on other PLC members.

Economy Gaza Strip


Economy - overview:
  High population density, limited land access, and strict internal
  and external security controls have kept economic conditions in the
  Gaza Strip - the smaller of the two areas under the Palestinian
  Authority (PA)- even more degraded than in the West Bank. The
  beginning of the second intifadah in September 2000 sparked an
  economic downturn, largely the result of Israeli closure policies;
  these policies, which were imposed to address security concerns in
  Israel, disrupted labor and trade access to and from the Gaza Strip.
  In 2001, and even more severely in 2003, Israeli military measures
  in PA areas resulted in the destruction of capital, the disruption
  of administrative structures, and widespread business closures. The
  Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip in September 2005 offered
  some medium-term opportunities for economic growth, which have not
  yet been realized due to Israeli military activities in the Gaza
  Strip in 2006, continued crossings closures, and the international
  community's financial embargo of the PA after HAMAS took office in
  March 2006.

Introduction Georgia


Background:
  The region of present-day Georgia contained the ancient kingdoms of
  Colchis and Kartli-Iberia. The area came under Roman influence in
  the first centuries A.D. and Christianity became the state religion
  in the 330s. Domination by Persians, Arabs, and Turks was followed
  by a Georgian golden age (11th-13th centuries) that was cut short by
  the Mongol invasion of 1236. Subsequently, the Ottoman and Persian
  empires competed for influence in the region. Georgia was absorbed
  into the Russian Empire in the 19th century. Independent for three
  years (1918-1921) following the Russian revolution, it was forcibly
  incorporated into the USSR until the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991.
  An attempt by the incumbent Georgian government to manipulate
  national legislative elections in November 2003 touched off
  widespread protests that led to the resignation of Eduard
  SHEVARDNADZE, president since 1995. New elections in early 2004
  swept Mikheil SAAKASHVILI into power along with his National
  Movement Party. Progress on market reforms and democratization has
  been made in the years since independence, but this progress has
  been complicated by two civil conflicts in the breakaway regions of
  Abkhazia and South Ossetia. These two territories remain outside the
  control of the central government and are ruled by de facto,
  unrecognized governments, supported by Russia. Russian-led
  peacekeeping operations continue in both regions. The Georgian
  Government put forward a new peace initiative for the peaceful
  resolution of the status of South Ossetia in 2005.

Economy Georgia


Economy - overview:
  Georgia's main economic activities include the cultivation of
  agricultural products such as grapes, citrus fruits, and hazelnuts;
  mining of manganese and copper; and output of a small industrial
  sector producing alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, metals,
  machinery, and chemicals. The country imports the bulk of its energy
  needs, including natural gas and oil products. It has sizeable but
  underdeveloped hydropower capacity. Despite the severe damage the
  economy has suffered due to civil strife, Georgia, with the help of
  the IMF and World Bank, has made substantial economic gains since
  2000, achieving positive GDP growth and curtailing inflation.
  Georgia had suffered from a chronic failure to collect tax revenues;
  however, the new government is making progress and has reformed the
  tax code, improved tax administration, increased tax enforcement,
  and cracked down on corruption. In addition, the reinvigorated
  privatization process has met with success, supplementing government
  expenditures on infrastructure, defense, and poverty reduction.
  Despite customs and financial (tax) enforcement improvements,
  smuggling is a drain on the economy. Georgia also suffers from
  energy shortages due to aging and badly maintained infrastructure,
  as well as poor management. Due to concerted reform efforts,
  collection rates have improved considerably to roughly 60%, both in
  T'bilisi and throughout the regions. Continued reform in the
  management of state-owned power entities is essential to successful
  privatization and onward sustainability in this sector. The country
  is pinning its hopes for long-term growth on its role as a transit
  state for pipelines and trade. The construction on the
  Baku-T'bilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline and the Baku-T'bilisi-Erzerum gas
  pipeline have brought much-needed investment and job opportunities.
  Nevertheless, high energy prices have compounded the pressure on the
  country's inefficient energy sector. Restructuring the sector and
  finding energy supply alternatives to Russia remain major challenges.

Introduction Germany


Background:
  As Europe's largest economy and second most populous nation,
  Germany is a key member of the continent's economic, political, and
  defense organizations. European power struggles immersed Germany in
  two devastating World Wars in the first half of the 20th century and
  left the country occupied by the victorious Allied powers of the US,
  UK, France, and the Soviet Union in 1945. With the advent of the
  Cold War, two German states were formed in 1949: the western Federal
  Republic of Germany (FRG) and the eastern German Democratic Republic
  (GDR). The democratic FRG embedded itself in key Western economic
  and security organizations, the EC, which became the EU, and NATO,
  while the Communist GDR was on the front line of the Soviet-led
  Warsaw Pact. The decline of the USSR and the end of the Cold War
  allowed for German unification in 1990. Since then, Germany has
  expended considerable funds to bring Eastern productivity and wages
  up to Western standards. In January 1999, Germany and 10 other EU
  countries introduced a common European exchange currency, the euro.

Economy Germany


Economy - overview:
  Germany's affluent and technologically powerful economy - the fifth
  largest in the world - has become one of the slowest growing
  economies in the euro zone. A quick turnaround is not in the offing
  in the foreseeable future; however, stronger growth this year has
  improved employment considerably. Growth in 2001-03 fell short of
  1%, rising to 1.7% in 2004, falling back to 0.9% in 2005, and
  increasing to 2.2% in 2006. Unemployment fell to 7.1% in October
  2006, based on the Internation Labor Organization's measurement. The
  modernization and integration of the eastern German economy
  continues to be a costly long-term process, with annual transfers
  from west to east amounting to roughly $70 billion. Germany's aging
  population, combined with high chronic unemployment, has pushed
  social security outlays to a level exceeding contributions from
  workers. Structural rigidities in the labor market - including
  strict regulations on laying off workers and the setting of wages on
  a national basis - and a lack of competition in the sevice sectors
  have made slow growth a chronic problem. Corporate restructuring and
  growing capital markets are setting the foundations that could help
  Germany meet the long-term challenges of European economic
  integration and globalization; however, the current government has
  failed to pass meaningful economic reform that would improve growth
  prospects. Higher government revenues from the cyclical upturn in
  2006 reduced Germany's budget deficit to within the EU's 3% debt
  limit.

Introduction Ghana


Background:
  Formed from the merger of the British colony of the Gold Coast and
  the Togoland trust territory, Ghana in 1957 became the first
  sub-Saharan country in colonial Africa to gain its independence. A
  long series of coups resulted in the suspension of the constitution
  in 1981 and a ban on political parties. A new constitution,
  restoring multiparty politics, was approved in 1992. Lt. Jerry
  RAWLINGS, head of state since 1981, won presidential elections in
  1992 and 1996, but was constitutionally prevented from running for a
  third term in 2000. John KUFUOR, who defeated former Vice President
  John ATTA-MILLS in a free and fair election, succeeded him.

Economy Ghana


Economy - overview:
  Well endowed with natural resources, Ghana has roughly twice the
  per capita output of the poorest countries in West Africa. Even so,
  Ghana remains heavily dependent on international financial and
  technical assistance. Gold, timber, and cocoa production are major
  sources of foreign exchange. The domestic economy continues to
  revolve around subsistence agriculture, which accounts for 34% of
  GDP and employs 60% of the work force, mainly small landholders.
  Ghana opted for debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Country
  (HIPC) program in 2002, but was included in a G-8 debt relief
  program decided upon at the Gleneagles Summit in July 2005.
  Priorities under its current $38 million Poverty Reduction and
  Growth Facility (PRGF) include tighter monetary and fiscal policies,
  accelerated privatization, and improvement of social services.
  Receipts from the gold sector helped sustain GDP growth in 2006
  along with record high prices for Ghana's largest cocoa crop to
  date. Ghana received a Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) grant
  in 2006, which aims to assist in transforming Ghana's agricultural
  export sector.

@Gibraltar

Introduction Gibraltar


Background:
  Strategically important, Gibraltar was reluctantly ceded to Great
  Britain by Spain in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht; the British garrison
  was formally declared a colony in 1830. In a referendum held in
  1967, Gibraltarians voted overwhelmingly to remain a British
  dependency. Although the current 1969 Constitution for Gibraltar
  states that the British government will never allow the people of
  Gibraltar to pass under the sovereignty of another state against
  their freely and democratically expressed wishes, a series of talks
  were held by the UK and Spain between 1997 and 2002 on establishing
  temporary joint sovereignty over Gibraltar. In response to these
  talks, the Gibraltarian Government set up a referendum in late 2002
  in which a majority of the citizens voted overwhelmingly against any
  sharing of sovereignty with Spain. Since the referendum, tripartite
  talks have been held with Spain, the UK, and Gibraltar, and in
  September 2006 a three-way agreement was signed. Spain agreed to
  allow airlines other than British to serve Gibraltar, to speed up
  customs procedures, and to add more telephone lines into Gibraltar.
  Britain agreed to pay pensions to Spaniards who had been employed in
  Gibraltar before the border closed in 1969. Spain will be allowed to
  open a cultural institute from which the Spanish flag will fly.

Economy Gibraltar


Economy - overview:
  Self-sufficient Gibraltar benefits from an extensive shipping
  trade, offshore banking, and its position as an international
  conference center. The British military presence has been sharply
  reduced and now contributes about 7% to the local economy, compared
  with 60% in 1984. The financial sector, tourism (almost 5 million
  visitors in 1998), shipping services fees, and duties on consumer
  goods also generate revenue. The financial sector, the shipping
  sector, and tourism each contribute 25%-30% of GDP.
  Telecommunications accounts for another 10%. In recent years,
  Gibraltar has seen major structural change from a public to a
  private sector economy, but changes in government spending still
  have a major impact on the level of employment.

Introduction Greece


Background:
  Greece achieved independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1829.
  During the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the
  20th century, it gradually added neighboring islands and
  territories, most with Greek-speaking populations. In World War II,
  Greece was first invaded by Italy (1940) and subsequently occupied
  by Germany (1941-44); fighting endured in a protracted civil war
  between supporters of the king and Communist rebels. Following the
  latter's defeat in 1949, Greece joined NATO in 1952. A military
  dictatorship, which in 1967 suspended many political liberties and
  forced the king to flee the country, lasted seven years. The 1974
  democratic elections and a referendum created a parliamentary
  republic and abolished the monarchy. In 1981 Greece joined the EC
  (now the EU); it became the 12th member of the euro zone in 2001.

Economy Greece


Economy - overview:
  Greece has a capitalist economy with the public sector accounting
  for about 40% of GDP and with per capita GDP at least 75% of the
  leading euro-zone economies. Tourism provides 15% of GDP. Immigrants
  make up nearly one-fifth of the work force, mainly in menial jobs.
  Greece is a major beneficiary of EU aid, equal to about 3.3% of
  annual GDP. The Greek economy grew by nearly 4.0% per year between
  2003 and 2006, largely because of an investment boom and
  infrastructure upgrades for the 2004 Athens Olympic Games. Greece
  has not met the EU's Growth and Stability Pact budget deficit
  criteria of 3% of GDP since 2000. Public debt, inflation, and
  unemployment are above the euro-zone average. To overcome these
  challenges, the Greek Government is expected to continue cutting
  government spending, reducing the size of the public sector, and
  reforming the labor and pension systems, despite vocal opposition
  from the country's powerful labor unions and the general public.

Introduction Greenland


Background:
  Greenland, the world's largest island, is about 81% ice-capped.
  Vikings reached the island in the 10th century from Iceland; Danish
  colonization began in the 18th century, and Greenland was made an
  integral part of Denmark in 1953. It joined the European Community
  (now the EU) with Denmark in 1973, but withdrew in 1985 over a
  dispute centered on stringent fishing quotas. Greenland was granted
  self-government in 1979 by the Danish parliament; the law went into
  effect the following year. Denmark continues to exercise control of
  Greenland's foreign affairs in consultation with Greenland's Home
  Rule Government.

Economy Greenland


Economy - overview:
  The economy remains critically dependent on exports of fish and
  substantial support from the Danish Government, which supplies about
  half of government revenues. The public sector, including
  publicly-owned enterprises and the municipalities, plays the
  dominant role in the economy. Despite several interesting
  hydrocarbon and mineral exploration activities, it will take a
  number of years before production can materialize. Tourism is the
  only sector offering any near-term potential, and even this is
  limited due to a short season and high costs.

Introduction Grenada


Background:
  Carib Indians inhabited Grenada when COLUMBUS discovered the island
  in 1498, but it remained uncolonized for more than a century. The
  French settled Grenada in the 17th century, established sugar
  estates, and imported large numbers of African slaves. Britain took
  the island in 1762 and vigorously expanded sugar production. In the
  19th century, cacao eventually surpassed sugar as the main export
  crop; in the 20th century, nutmeg became the leading export. In
  1967, Britain gave Grenada autonomy over its internal affairs. Full
  independence was attained in 1974 making Grenada one of the smallest
  independent countries in the Western Hemisphere. Grenada was seized
  by a Marxist military council on 19 October 1983. Six days later the
  island was invaded by US forces and those of six other Caribbean
  nations, which quickly captured the ringleaders and their hundreds
  of Cuban advisers. Free elections were reinstituted the following
  year and have continued since that time. Hurricane Ivan struck
  Grenada in September of 2004 causing severe damage.

Economy Guatemala


Economy - overview:
  Guatemala is the largest and most populous of the Central American
  countries with a GDP per capita roughly one-half that of Brazil,
  Argentina, and Chile. The agricultural sector accounts for about
  one-fourth of GDP, two-fifths of exports, and half of the labor
  force. Coffee, sugar, and bananas are the main products. The 1996
  signing of peace accords, which ended 36 years of civil war, removed
  a major obstacle to foreign investment, and Guatemala since then has
  pursued important reforms and macroeconomic stabilization. The
  distribution of income remains highly unequal with about 75% of the
  population below the poverty line. Other ongoing challenges include
  increasing government revenues, negotiating further assistance from
  international donors, upgrading both government and private
  financial operations, curtailing drug trafficking, and narrowing the
  trade deficit. Remittances from a large expatriate community that
  moved to the United States during the war have become an important
  source of foreign exchange.

@Guinea

Introduction Guinea


Background:
  Guinea has had only two presidents since gaining its independence
  from France in 1958. Lansana CONTE came to power in 1984 when the
  military seized the government after the death of the first
  president, Sekou TOURE. Guinea did not hold democratic elections
  until 1993 when Gen. CONTE (head of the military government) was
  elected president of the civilian government. He was reelected in
  1998 and again in 2003. Unrest in Sierra Leone and Liberia has
  spilled over into Guinea on several occasions over the past decade,

  2006, declining economic conditions prompted two massive strikes
  that sparked urban unrest in many Guinean cities.

Economy Guinea


Economy - overview:
  Guinea possesses major mineral, hydropower, and agricultural
  resources, yet remains an underdeveloped nation. The country
  possesses almost half of the world's bauxite reserves and is the
  second-largest bauxite producer. The mining sector accounts for over
  70% of exports. Long-run improvements in government fiscal
  arrangements, literacy, and the legal framework are needed if the
  country is to move out of poverty. Fighting along the Sierra Leonean
  and Liberian borders, as well as refugee movements, have caused
  major economic disruptions, aggravating a loss in investor
  confidence. Panic buying has created food shortages and inflation
  and caused riots in local markets. Guinea is trying to reengage with
  the IMF and World Bank, which cut off most assistance in 2003.
  Growth rose slightly in 2006, primarily due to increases in global
  demand and commodity prices on world markets, but the standard of
  living fell. The Guinea franc depreciated sharply as the prices for
  basic necessities like food and fuel rose beyond the reach of most
  Guineans. Dissatisfaction with economic conditions prompted
  nationwide strikes in February and June 2006.

@Guinea-Bissau

Introduction Guinea-Bissau


Background:
  Since independence from Portugal in 1974, Guinea-Bissau has
  experienced considerable political and military upheaval. In 1980, a
  military coup established authoritarian dictator Joao Bernardo
  'Nino' VIEIRA as president. Despite setting a path to a market
  economy and multiparty system, VIEIRA's regime was characterized by
  the suppression of political opposition and the purging of political
  rivals. Several coup attempts through the 1980s and early 1990s
  failed to unseat him. In 1994 VIEIRA was elected president in the
  country's first free elections. A military mutiny and resulting
  civil war in 1998 eventually led to VIEIRA's ouster in May 1999. In
  February 2000, a transitional government turned over power to
  opposition leader Kumba YALA, after he was elected president in
  transparent polling. In September 2003, after only three years in
  office, YALA was ousted by the military in a bloodless coup, and
  businessman Henrique ROSA was sworn in as interim president. In
  2005, former President VIEIRA was re-elected president pledging to
  pursue economic development and national reconciliation.

Economy Guinea-Bissau


Economy - overview:
  One of the 10 poorest countries in the world, Guinea-Bissau depends
  mainly on farming and fishing. Cashew crops have increased
  remarkably in recent years, and the country now ranks sixth in
  cashew production. Guinea-Bissau exports fish and seafood along with
  small amounts of peanuts, palm kernels, and timber. Rice is the
  major crop and staple food. However, intermittent fighting between
  Senegalese-backed government troops and a military junta destroyed
  much of the country's infrastructure and caused widespread damage to
  the economy in 1998; the civil war led to a 28% drop in GDP that
  year, with partial recovery in 1999-2002. Before the war, trade
  reform and price liberalization were the most successful part of the
  country's structural adjustment program under IMF sponsorship. The
  tightening of monetary policy and the development of the private
  sector had also begun to reinvigorate the economy. Because of high
  costs, the development of petroleum, phosphate, and other mineral
  resources is not a near-term prospect. However, offshore oil
  prospecting has begun and could lead to much-needed revenue in the
  long run. The inequality of income distribution is one of the most
  extreme in the world. The government and international donors
  continue to work out plans to forward economic development from a
  lamentably low base. In December 2003, the World Bank, IMF, and UNDP
  were forced to step in to provide emergency budgetary support in the
  amount of $107 million for 2004, representing over 80% of the total
  national budget. Government drift and indecision, however, have
  resulted in continued low growth in 2002-06.

Introduction Guyana


Background:
  Originally a Dutch colony in the 17th century, by 1815 Guyana had
  become a British possession. The abolition of slavery led to black
  settlement of urban areas and the importation of indentured servants
  from India to work the sugar plantations. This ethnocultural divide
  has persisted and has led to turbulent politics. Guyana achieved
  independence from the UK in 1966, and since then it has been ruled
  mostly by socialist-oriented governments. In 1992, Cheddi JAGAN was
  elected president in what is considered the country's first free and
  fair election since independence. After his death five years later,
  his wife, Jane JAGAN, became president but resigned in 1999 due to
  poor health. Her successor, Bharrat JAGDEO, was reelected in 2001
  and again in 2006.

Economy Guyana


Economy - overview:
  The Guyanese economy exhibited moderate economic growth in 2001-02,
  based on expansion in the agricultural and mining sectors, a more
  favorable atmosphere for business initiatives, a more realistic
  exchange rate, fairly low inflation, and the continued support of
  international organizations. Chronic problems include a shortage of
  skilled labor and a deficient infrastructure. The government is
  juggling a sizable external debt against the urgent need for
  expanded public investment. The InterAmerican Development Bank in
  November 2006 canceled Guyana's nearly $400 million debt with the
  Bank. The bauxite mining sector should benefit in the near term from
  restructuring and partial privatization. Export earnings from
  agriculture and mining have fallen sharply, while the import bill
  has risen, driven by higher energy prices. Guyana's entrance into
  the Caricom Single Market and Economy (CSME) in January 2006 will
  broaden the country's export market, primarily in the raw materials
  sector.

Introduction Haiti


Background:
  The native Taino Amerindians - who inhabited the island of
  Hispaniola when it was discovered by COLUMBUS in 1492 - were
  virtually annihilated by Spanish settlers within 25 years. In the
  early 17th century, the French established a presence on Hispaniola,
  and in 1697, Spain ceded to the French the western third of the
  island, which later became Haiti. The French colony, based on
  forestry and sugar-related industries, became one of the wealthiest
  in the Caribbean, but only through the heavy importation of African
  slaves and considerable environmental degradation. In the late 18th
  century, Haiti's nearly half million slaves revolted under Toussaint
  L'OUVERTURE. After a prolonged struggle, Haiti became the first
  black republic to declare its independence in 1804. The poorest
  country in the Western Hemisphere, Haiti has been plagued by
  political violence for most of its history. After an armed rebellion
  led to the departure of President Jean-Betrand ARISTIDE in February
  2004, an interim government took office to organize new elections
  under the auspices of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in
  Haiti (MINUSTAH). Continued violence and technical delays prompted
  repeated postponements, but Haiti finally did inaugurate a
  democratically elected president and parliament in May of 2006.

Economy Haiti


Economy - overview:
  Haiti is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, with 80% of
  the population living under the poverty line and 54% in abject
  poverty. Two-thirds of all Haitians depend on the agriculture
  sector, mainly small-scale subsistence farming, and remain
  vulnerable to damage from frequent natural disasters, exacerbated by
  the country's widespread deforestation. A macroeconomic program
  developed in 2005 with the help of the International Monetary Fund
  helped the economy grow 1.8% in 2006, the highest growth rate since
  1999. Haiti suffers from higher inflation than similar low-income
  countries, a lack of investment, and a severe trade deficit. In
  2005, Haiti paid its arrears to the World Bank, paving the way for
  reengagement with the Bank. The government relies on formal
  international economic assistance for fiscal sustainability. In
  2006, Haiti held a successful donors conference in which the total
  aid pledged exceeded Haiti's request. Remittances are the primary
  source of foreign exchange, equaling nearly a quarter of GDP.

@Holy See (Vatican City)

Introduction Holy See (Vatican City)


Background:
  Popes in their secular role ruled portions of the Italian peninsula
  for more than a thousand years until the mid 19th century, when many
  of the Papal States were seized by the newly united Kingdom of
  Italy. In 1870, the pope's holdings were further circumscribed when
  Rome itself was annexed. Disputes between a series of "prisoner"
  popes and Italy were resolved in 1929 by three Lateran Treaties,
  which established the independent state of Vatican City and granted
  Roman Catholicism special status in Italy. In 1984, a concordat
  between the Holy See and Italy modified certain of the earlier
  treaty provisions, including the primacy of Roman Catholicism as the
  Italian state religion. Present concerns of the Holy See include
  religious freedom, international development, the Middle East,
  terrorism, interreligious dialogue and reconciliation, and the
  application of church doctrine in an era of rapid change and
  globalization. About 1 billion people worldwide profess the Catholic
  faith.

Introduction Honduras


Background:
  Once part of Spain's vast empire in the New World, Honduras became
  an independent nation in 1821. After two and a half decades of
  mostly military rule, a freely elected civilian government came to
  power in 1982. During the 1980s, Honduras proved a haven for
  anti-Sandinista contras fighting the Marxist Nicaraguan Government
  and an ally to Salvadoran Government forces fighting leftist
  guerrillas. The country was devastated by Hurricane Mitch in 1998,
  which killed about 5,600 people and caused approximately $2 billion
  in damage.

Economy Honduras


Economy - overview:
  Honduras, the second poorest country in Central America and one of
  the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere, with an
  extraordinarily unequal distribution of income and massive
  unemployment, is banking on expanded trade under the US-Central
  America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) and on debt relief under the
  Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. The country has
  met most of its macroeconomic targets, and began a three-year IMF
  Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PGRF) program in February
  2004. The economy relies heavily on a narrow range of exports,
  notably bananas and coffee, making it vulnerable to natural
  disasters and shifts in commodity prices, but in recent years has
  experienced a rapid rise in exports of light manufacturers. Growth
  remains dependent on the economy of the US, its largest trading
  partner, and on reduction of the high crime rate, as a means of
  attracting and maintaining investment.

  demarcation of the border remains stalled; the 1992 ICJ ruling
  advised a tripartite resolution to a maritime boundary in the Gulf
  of Fonseca with consideration of Honduran access to the Pacific; El
  Salvador continues to claim tiny Conejo Island, not mentioned in the
  ICJ ruling, off Honduras in the Gulf of Fonseca; Honduras claims
  Sapodilla Cays off the coast of Belize, but agreed to creation of a
  joint ecological park and Guatemalan corridor in the Caribbean in
  the failed 2002 Belize-Guatemala Differendum, which the OAS is
  attempting to revive; Nicaragua filed a claim against Honduras in

@Hong Kong

Introduction Hong Kong


Background:
  Occupied by the UK in 1841, Hong Kong was formally ceded by China
  the following year; various adjacent lands were added later in the
  19th century. Pursuant to an agreement signed by China and the UK on
  19 December 1984, Hong Kong became the Hong Kong Special
  Administrative Region (SAR) of China on 1 July 1997. In this
  agreement, China has promised that, under its "one country, two

Economy Hong Kong


Economy - overview:
  Hong Kong has a free market economy highly dependent on
  international trade. The territory has become more closely linked to
  mainland China over the past few years. Even before Hong Kong
  reverted to Chinese administration on 1 July 1997, it had extensive
  trade and investment ties with China. Hong Kong's service industry
  over the past decade has grown rapidly as its manufacturing industry
  has moved to the mainland. Hong Kong also has stepped up its efforts
  to gain approval to offer more mainland financial services in a bid
  to remain competitive with China's growing financial centers. Hong
  Kong's natural resources are limited, and food and raw materials
  must be imported. Gross imports and exports (i.e., including
  reexports to and from third countries) each exceed GDP in dollar
  value. Per capita GDP exceeds that of the four big economies of
  Western Europe. GDP growth averaged a strong 5% from 1989 to 2006,
  but Hong Kong suffered two recessions in the past eight years
  because of the Asian financial crisis in 1997-1998 and the global
  downturn in 2001-2002. Although the Severe Acute Respiratory
  Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 also battered Hong Kong's economy,
  a solid rise in exports, a boom in tourism from the mainland because
  of China's easing of travel restrictions, and a return of consumer
  confidence resulted in the resumption of strong growth from late
  2003 through 2006. Moreover, several large initial public offerings
  of Chinese companies on the Hong Kong stock exchange since late 2005
  have helped to boost Hong Kong's status as a financial hub and have
  contributed to the improved performance of the market in late 2006.

Introduction Hungary


Background:
  Hungary was part of the polyglot Austro-Hungarian Empire, which
  collapsed during World War I. The country fell under Communist rule
  following World War II. In 1956, a revolt and announced withdrawal
  from the Warsaw Pact were met with a massive military intervention
  by Moscow. Under the leadership of Janos KADAR in 1968, Hungary
  began liberalizing its economy, introducing so-called "Goulash
  Communism." Hungary held its first multiparty elections in 1990 and
  initiated a free market economy. It joined NATO in 1999 and the EU
  in 2004.

Economy Hungary


Economy - overview:
  Hungary has made the transition from a centrally planned to a
  market economy, with a per capita income nearly two-thirds that of
  the EU-25 average. Hungary continues to demonstrate strong economic
  growth and acceded to the EU in May 2004. The private sector
  accounts for over 80% of GDP. Foreign ownership of and investment in
  Hungarian firms are widespread, with cumulative foreign direct
  investment totaling more than $60 billion since 1989. Hungarian
  sovereign debt was upgraded in 2000 - together with the Czech
  Republic, Hungary holds the highest rating among the Central
  European transition economies. Rating agencies, however, have
  expressed concerns over Hungary's fiscal and current account
  deficits. Inflation has declined from 14% in 1998 to 3.7% in 2006.
  Unemployment has persisted above 6%. Hungary's labor force
  participation rate of 57% is one of the lowest in the Organization
  for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Germany is by far
  Hungary's largest economic partner. Policy challenges include
  cutting the public sector deficit to 3% of GDP by 2008, from about
  6.5% in 2006, and orchestrating an orderly interest rate reduction
  without sparking capital outflows.

Introduction Iceland


Background:
  Settled by Norwegian and Celtic (Scottish and Irish) immigrants
  during the late 9th and 10th centuries A.D., Iceland boasts the
  world's oldest functioning legislative assembly, the Althing,
  established in 930. Independent for over 300 years, Iceland was
  subsequently ruled by Norway and Denmark. Fallout from the Askja
  volcano of 1875 devastated the Icelandic economy and caused
  widespread famine. Over the next quarter century, 20% of the
  island's population emigrated, mostly to Canada and the US. Limited
  home rule from Denmark was granted in 1874 and complete independence
  attained in 1944. Literacy, longevity, income, and social cohesion
  are first-rate by world standards.

Economy Iceland


Economy - overview:
  Iceland's Scandinavian-type economy is basically capitalistic, yet
  with an extensive welfare system (including generous housing
  subsidies), low unemployment, and remarkably even distribution of
  income. In the absence of other natural resources (except for
  abundant geothermal power), the economy depends heavily on the
  fishing industry, which provides nearly 60% of export earnings and
  employs 6% of the work force. The economy remains sensitive to
  declining fish stocks as well as to fluctuations in world prices for
  its main exports: fish and fish products, aluminum, and
  ferrosilicon. Government policies include reducing the current
  account deficit, limiting foreign borrowing, containing inflation,
  revising agricultural and fishing policies, and diversifying the
  economy. The government remains opposed to EU membership, primarily
  because of Icelanders' concern about losing control over their
  fishing resources. Iceland's economy has been diversifying into
  manufacturing and service industries in the last decade, and new
  developments in software production, biotechnology, and financial
  services are taking place. The tourism sector is also expanding,
  with the recent trends in ecotourism and whale watching. Since 2000
  growth has varied from a -1% in 2002 to 8% in 2004.

@Iles Eparses

Introduction Iles Eparses


Background:
  The Iles Eparses, or scattered islands, are a group of five French
  entities - Bassas da India, Europa Island, Glorioso Islands, Juan de
  Nova Island, and Tromelin Island - which on 1 April 1960 came under
  the authority of the Minister in charge of overseas possessions. On
  19 September 1960 by decree, the islands were transferred to the
  charge of the Prefet of Reunion where they remained until 3 January
  2005 when they were transferred by another decree to the Senior
  Administrator of the Territory of the French Southern and Antarctic
  Lands (TAAF).
  Bassas da India: A French possession since 1897, this atoll is a
  volcanic seamount surrounded by reefs and awash at high tide.
  Europa Island: A French possession since 1897, the island is heavily
  wooded; it is the site of a small military garrison that staffs a
  weather station.
  Glorioso Islands: A French possession since 1892, the Glorioso
  Islands are composed of two lushly vegetated coral islands (Ile
  Glorieuse and Ile du Lys) and three rock islets. A military garrison
  operates a weather and radio station on Ile Glorieuse.
  Juan de Nova Island: Named after a famous 15th century Spanish
  navigator and explorer, the island has been a French possession
  since 1897. It has been exploited for its guano and phosphate.
  Presently a small military garrison oversees a meteorological
  station.
  Tromelin Island: First explored by the French in 1776, the island
  came under the jurisdiction of Reunion in 1814. At present, it
  serves as a sea turtle sanctuary and is the site of an important
  meteorological station.

Introduction India


Background:
  The Indus Valley civilization, one of the oldest in the world,
  dates back at least 5,000 years. Aryan tribes from the northwest
  infiltrated onto Indian lands about 1500 B.C.; their merger with the
  earlier Dravidian inhabitants created the classical Indian culture.
  Arab incursions starting in the 8th century and Turkish in the 12th
  were followed by those of European traders, beginning in the late
  15th century. By the 19th century, Britain had assumed political
  control of virtually all Indian lands. Indian armed forces in the
  British army played a vital role in both World Wars. Nonviolent
  resistance to British colonialism led by Mohandas GANDHI and
  Jawaharlal NEHRU brought independence in 1947. The subcontinent was
  divided into the secular state of India and the smaller Muslim state
  of Pakistan. A third war between the two countries in 1971 resulted
  in East Pakistan becoming the separate nation of Bangladesh. Despite
  impressive gains in economic investment and output, India faces
  pressing problems such as the ongoing dispute with Pakistan over
  Kashmir, massive overpopulation, environmental degradation,
  extensive poverty, and ethnic and religious strife.

Economy India


Economy - overview:
  India's diverse economy encompasses traditional village farming,
  modern agriculture, handicrafts, a wide range of modern industries,
  and a multitude of services. Services are the major source of
  economic growth, accounting for more than half of India's output
  with less than one quarter of its labor force. About three-fifths of
  the work force is in agriculture, leading the UPA government to
  articulate an economic reform program that includes developing basic
  infrastructure to improve the lives of the rural poor and boost
  economic performance. The government has reduced controls on foreign
  trade and investment. Tariffs averaged 12.5% on non-agricultural
  items in 2006. Higher limits on foreign direct investment were
  permitted in a few key sectors, such as telecommunications. However,
  tariff spikes in sensitive categories, including agriculture, and
  incremental progress on economic reforms still hinder foreign access
  to India's vast and growing market. Privatization of
  government-owned industries remained stalled in 2006, and continues
  to generate political debate; populist pressure from within the UPA
  government and from its Left Front allies continues to restrain
  needed initiatives. The economy has posted an average growth rate of
  more than 7% in the decade since 1996, reducing poverty by about 10
  percentage points. India achieved 8.5% GDP growth in 2006,
  significantly expanding manufacturing. India is capitalizing on its
  large numbers of well-educated people skilled in the English
  language to become a major exporter of software services and
  software workers. Economic expansion has helped New Delhi continue
  to make progress in reducing its federal fiscal deficit. However,
  strong growth - more than 8 percent growth in each of the last three
  years - combined with easy consumer credit and a real estate boom is
  fueling inflation concerns. The huge and growing population is the
  fundamental social, economic, and environmental problem.

Telephones - mobile cellular:
  69,193,321 (2006)

Telephone system:
  general assessment: recent deregulation and liberalization of
  telecommunications laws and policies have prompted rapid growth;
  local and long distance service provided throughout all regions of
  the country, with services primarily concentrated in the urban
  areas; steady improvement is taking place with the recent admission
  of private and private-public investors, but telephone density
  remains low at about ten for each 100 persons nationwide and only
  one per 100 persons in rural areas; there remains a national waiting
  list of over 1.7 million; fastest growth is in cellular service with
  modest growth in fixed lines
  domestic: expansion of domestic service, although still weak in
  rural areas, resulted from increased competition and dramatic
  reductions in price led in large part by wireless service; mobile
  cellular service (both CDMA and GSM) introduced in 1994 and
  organized nationwide into four metropolitan cities and 19 telecom
  circles each with about three private service providers and one
  state-owned service provider; in recent years significant trunk
  capacity added in the form of fiber-optic cable and one of the
  world's largest domestic satellite systems, the Indian National
  Satellite system (INSAT), with six satellites supporting 33,000 very
  small aperture terminals (VSAT)
  international: country code - 91; nine satellite earth stations - 8
  Intelsat (Indian Ocean) and 1 Inmarsat (Indian Ocean region); nine
  gateway exchanges operating from Mumbai (Bombay), New Delhi, Kolkata
  (Calcutta), Chennai (Madras), Jalandhar, Kanpur, Gandhinagar,
  Hyderabad, and Ernakulam; 6 submarine cables, including Sea-Me-We-3
  with landing sites at Cochin and Mumbai (Bombay), Sea-Me-We-4 with

Transnational Issues India


Disputes - international:
  since China and India launched a security and foreign policy
  dialogue in 2005, consolidated discussions related to the dispute
  over most of their rugged, militarized boundary, regional nuclear
  proliferation, Indian claims that China transferred missiles to
  Pakistan, and other matters continue; various talks and
  confidence-building measures have cautiously begun to defuse
  tensions over Kashmir, particularly since the October 2005
  earthquake in the region; Kashmir nevertheless remains the site of
  the world's largest and most militarized territorial dispute with
  portions under the de facto administration of China (Aksai Chin),
  India (Jammu and Kashmir), and Pakistan (Azad Kashmir and Northern
  Areas); in 2004, India and Pakistan instituted a cease fire in
  Kashmir and in 2005, restored bus service across the highly
  militarized Line of Control; Pakistan has taken its dispute on the
  impact and benefits of India's building the Baglihar Dam on the
  Chenab River in Jammu and Kashmir to the World Bank for arbitration;
  UN Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) has
  maintained a small group of peacekeepers since 1949; India does not
  recognize Pakistan's ceding historic Kashmir lands to China in 1964;
  disputes persist with Pakistan over Indus River water sharing; to
  defuse tensions and prepare for discussions on a maritime boundary,
  in 2004, India and Pakistan resurveyed a portion of the disputed
  boundary in Sir Creek estuary at the mouth of the Rann of Kutch;
  Pakistani maps continue to show its Junagadh claim in Indian Gujarat
  State; discussions with Bangladesh remain stalled to delimit a small
  section of river boundary, to exchange 162 miniscule enclaves in
  both countries, to allocate divided villages, and to stop illegal
  cross-border trade, migration, violence, and transit of terrorists
  through the porous border; Bangladesh protests India's attempts to
  fence off high-traffic sections of the border; dispute with
  Bangladesh over New Moore/South Talpatty/Purbasha Island in the Bay
  of Bengal deters maritime boundary delimitation; India seeks
  cooperation from Bhutan and Burma to keep Indian Nagaland and Assam
  separatists from hiding in remote areas along the borders; Joint
  Border Committee with Nepal continues to demarcate minor disputed
  boundary sections; India maintains a strict border regime to keep
  out Maoist insurgents and control illegal cross-border activities
  from Nepal

Refugees and internally displaced persons:
  refugees (country of origin): 77,200 (Tibet/China), 50,730 (Sri
  Lanka), 9,700 (Afghanistan)
  IDPs: at least 600,000 (about half are Kashmiri Pandits from Jammu
  and Kashmir) (2006)

Trafficking in persons:
  current situation: India is a source, destination, and transit
  country for men, women, and children trafficked for the purposes of
  forced or bonded labor and commercial sexual exploitation; the large
  population of men, women, and children - numbering in the millions -
  in debt bondage face involuntary servitude in brick kilns, rice
  mills, and embroidery factories, while some children endure
  involuntary servitude as domestic servants; internal trafficking of
  women and girls for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation
  and forced marriage also occurs; the government estimates that 90
  percent of India's sex trafficking is internal; India is also a
  destination for women and girls from Nepal and Bangladesh trafficked
  for the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation; boys from
  Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Bangladesh are trafficked through India
  to the Gulf states for involuntary servitude as child camel jockeys;
  Indian men and women migrate willingly to the Persian Gulf region
  for work as domestic servants and low-skilled laborers, but some
  later find themselves in situations of involuntary servitude
  including extended working hours, nonpayment of wages, restrictions
  on their movement by withholding of their passports or confinement
  to the home, and physical or sexual abuse
  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - India has been on the Tier 2 Watch
  List since 2004 for its failure to show evidence of increasing
  efforts to address trafficking in persons

Illicit drugs:
  world's largest producer of licit opium for the pharmaceutical
  trade, but an undetermined quantity of opium is diverted to illicit
  international drug markets; transit point for illicit narcotics
  produced in neighboring countries; illicit producer of methaqualone;
  vulnerable to narcotics money laundering through the hawala system

@Indian Ocean



Background:
  The Indian Ocean is the third largest of the world's five oceans
  (after the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean, but larger than the
  Southern Ocean and Arctic Ocean). Four critically important access
  waterways are the Suez Canal (Egypt), Bab el Mandeb
  (Djibouti-Yemen), Strait of Hormuz (Iran-Oman), and Strait of
  Malacca (Indonesia-Malaysia). The decision by the International
  Hydrographic Organization in the spring of 2000 to delimit a fifth
  ocean, the Southern Ocean, removed the portion of the Indian Ocean
  south of 60 degrees south latitude.

Geography Indian Ocean


Location:
  body of water between Africa, the Southern Ocean, Asia, and
  Australia

Geographic coordinates:
  20 00 S, 80 00 E

Map references:
  Political Map of the World

Area:
  total: 68.556 million sq km
  note: includes Andaman Sea, Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal, Flores Sea,
  Great Australian Bight, Gulf of Aden, Gulf of Oman, Java Sea,
  Mozambique Channel, Persian Gulf, Red Sea, Savu Sea, Strait of
  Malacca, Timor Sea, and other tributary water bodies

Area - comparative:
  about 5.5 times the size of the US

Coastline:
  66,526 km

Climate:
  northeast monsoon (December to April), southwest monsoon (June to
  October); tropical cyclones occur during May/June and
  October/November in the northern Indian Ocean and January/February
  in the southern Indian Ocean

Terrain:
  surface dominated by counterclockwise gyre (broad, circular system
  of currents) in the southern Indian Ocean; unique reversal of
  surface currents in the northern Indian Ocean; low atmospheric
  pressure over southwest Asia from hot, rising, summer air results in
  the southwest monsoon and southwest-to-northeast winds and currents,
  while high pressure over northern Asia from cold, falling, winter
  air results in the northeast monsoon and northeast-to-southwest
  winds and currents; ocean floor is dominated by the Mid-Indian Ocean
  Ridge and subdivided by the Southeast Indian Ocean Ridge, Southwest
  Indian Ocean Ridge, and Ninetyeast Ridge

Elevation extremes:
  lowest point: Java Trench -7,258 m
  highest point: sea level 0 m

Natural resources:
  oil and gas fields, fish, shrimp, sand and gravel aggregates,
  placer deposits, polymetallic nodules

Natural hazards:
  occasional icebergs pose navigational hazard in southern reaches

Environment - current issues:
  endangered marine species include the dugong, seals, turtles, and
  whales; oil pollution in the Arabian Sea, Persian Gulf, and Red Sea

Geography - note:
  major chokepoints include Bab el Mandeb, Strait of Hormuz, Strait
  of Malacca, southern access to the Suez Canal, and the Lombok Strait



Economy Indian Ocean


Economy - overview:
  The Indian Ocean provides major sea routes connecting the Middle
  East, Africa, and East Asia with Europe and the Americas. It carries
  a particularly heavy traffic of petroleum and petroleum products
  from the oilfields of the Persian Gulf and Indonesia. Its fish are
  of great and growing importance to the bordering countries for
  domestic consumption and export. Fishing fleets from Russia, Japan,
  South Korea, and Taiwan also exploit the Indian Ocean, mainly for
  shrimp and tuna. Large reserves of hydrocarbons are being tapped in
  the offshore areas of Saudi Arabia, Iran, India, and western
  Australia. An estimated 40% of the world's offshore oil production
  comes from the Indian Ocean. Beach sands rich in heavy minerals and
  offshore placer deposits are actively exploited by bordering
  countries, particularly India, South Africa, Indonesia, Sri Lanka,
  and Thailand.


Transportation Indian Ocean

@Indonesia

Introduction Indonesia


Background:
  The Dutch began to colonize Indonesia in the early 17th century;
  the islands were occupied by Japan from 1942 to 1945. Indonesia
  declared its independence after Japan's surrender, but it required
  four years of intermittent negotiations, recurring hostilities, and
  UN mediation before the Netherlands agreed to relinquish its colony.
  Indonesia is the world's largest archipelagic state and home to the
  world's largest Muslim population. Current issues include:
  alleviating poverty, preventing terrorism, consolidating democracy
  after four decades of authoritarianism, implementing financial
  sector reforms, stemming corruption, and holding the military and
  police accountable for human rights violations. Indonesia was the
  nation worst hit by the December 2004 tsunami, which particularly
  affected Aceh province causing over 100,000 deaths and over $4
  billion in damage. An additional earthquake in March 2005 created
  heavy destruction on the island of Nias. Reconstruction in these
  areas may take up to a decade. In 2005, Indonesia reached a historic
  peace agreement with armed separatists in Aceh, but it continues to
  face a low intensity separatist guerilla movement in Papua.

Economy Indonesia


Economy - overview:
  Indonesia, a vast polyglot nation, has struggled to overcome the
  Asian financial crisis, and still grapples with high poverty and
  unemployment, inadequate infrastructure, endemic corruption, a
  fragile banking sector, a poor investment climate, and unequal
  resource distribution among regions. The country continues the slow
  work of rebuilding from the devastating December 2004 tsunami and
  from an earthquake in central Java in May 2006 that caused over $3
  billion in damage and losses. Declining oil production and lack of
  new exploration investment turned Indonesia into a net oil importer
  in 2004. The cost of subsidizing domestic fuel placed increasing
  strain on the budget in 2005, and combined with indecisive monetary
  policy, contributed to a run on the currency in August, prompting
  the government to enact a 126% average fuel price hike in October.
  The resulting inflation and interest rate hikes dampened growth
  through mid-2006, while large increases in rice prices pushed
  millions more people under the national poverty line. Economic
  reformers introduced three policy packages in 2006 to improve the
  investment climate, infrastructure, and the financial sector, but
  translating them into reality has not been easy. Keys to future
  growth remain internal reform, building up the confidence of
  international and domestic investors, and strong global economic
  growth.

  of Pulau Batek/Fatu Sinai, which hinders a decision on a northern
  maritime boundary; a 1997 treaty between Indonesia and Australia
  settled some parts of their maritime boundary but outstanding issues
  remain; ICJ's award of Sipadan and Ligitan islands to Malaysia in
  2002 left maritime boundary in the hydrocarbon-rich Celebes Sea in
  dispute, culminating in hostile confrontations in March 2005 over
  concessions to the Ambalat oil block; the ICJ decision has prompted
  Indonesia to assert claims to and to establish a presence on its
  smaller outer islands; Indonesia and Singapore pledged in 2005 to
  finalize their 1973 maritime boundary agreement by defining
  unresolved areas north of Batam Island; Indonesian secessionists,
  squatters, and illegal migrants create repatriation problems for
  Papua New Guinea; piracy remains a problem in the Malacca Strait

Refugees and internally displaced persons:
  IDPs: 200,000-350,000 (government offensives against rebels in
  Aceh; most IDPs in Aceh, Central Kalimantan, Central Sulawesi
  Provinces, and Maluku), 300,000 (December 2006 floods in Aceh
  regions) (2006)

Trafficking in persons:
  current situation: Indonesia is a source, transit, and destination
  country for women, children and men trafficked for the purposes of
  sexual exploitation and forced labor; Indonesian victims are
  trafficked to Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, UAE, Hong Kong,
  Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, and Singapore; a significant number of
  Indonesian women who go overseas each year to work as domestic
  servants or "cultural performers" are subjected to conditions of
  involuntary servitude and commercial sexual exploitation; to a
  minimal extent, Indonesia is a destination for women from East Asia,
  Europe, and South America who are trafficked for sexual
  exploitation; there is extensive trafficking within Indonesia from
  rural to urban metropolitan areas particularly for sexual
  exploitation and involuntary domestic servitude
  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Indonesia is placed on the Tier 2
  Watch List for its failure to provide evidence of increasing efforts
  to combat trafficking

Illicit drugs:
  illicit producer of cannabis largely for domestic use; producer of
  methamphetamine and ecstasy

Introduction Iran


Background:
  Known as Persia until 1935, Iran became an Islamic republic in 1979
  after the ruling monarchy was overthrown and the shah was forced
  into exile. Conservative clerical forces established a theocratic
  system of government with ultimate political authority nominally
  vested in a learned religious scholar. Iranian-US relations have
  been strained since a group of Iranian students seized the US
  Embassy in Tehran on 4 November 1979 and held it until 20 January
  1981. During 1980-88, Iran fought a bloody, indecisive war with Iraq
  that eventually expanded into the Persian Gulf and led to clashes
  between US Navy and Iranian military forces between 1987-1988. Iran
  has been designated a state sponsor of terrorism for its activities
  in Lebanon and elsewhere in the world and remains subject to US
  economic sanctions and export controls because of its continued
  involvement. Following the elections of a reformist president and
  Majlis in the late 1990s, attempts to foster political reform in
  response to popular dissatisfaction floundered as conservative
  politicians prevented reform measures from being enacted, increased
  repressive measures, and made electoral gains against reformers.
  Parliamentary elections in 2004 and the August 2005 inauguration of
  a conservative stalwart as president, completed the reconsolidation
  of conservative power in Iran's government.

  called the 2nd Khordad Front, which includes political parties as
  well as less formal pressure groups and organizations, achieved
  considerable success at elections to the sixth Majles in early 2000;
  groups in the coalition include: Islamic Iran Participation Front
  (IIPF), Executives of Construction Party (Kargozaran), Solidarity
  Party, Islamic Labor Party, Mardom Salari, Mojahedin of the Islamic
  Revolution Organization (MIRO), and Militant Clerics Society
  (Ruhaniyun); the coalition participated in the seventh Majles
  elections in early 2004; following his defeat in the 2005
  presidential elections, former MCS Secretary General Mehdi KARRUBI
  formed the National Trust Party; a new apparently conservative
  group, the Builders of Islamic Iran, took a leading position in the
  new Majles after winning a majority of the seats in February 2004

Political pressure groups and leaders:
  political pressure groups conduct most of Iran's political
  activities; groups that generally support the Islamic Republic
  include Ansar-e Hizballah, Muslim Students Following the Line of the
  Imam, Tehran Militant Clergy Association (Ruhaniyat), Islamic
  Coalition Party (Motalefeh), and Islamic Engineers Society; active
  pro-reform student groups include the Office of Strengthening Unity
  (OSU); opposition groups include Freedom Movement of Iran, the
  National Front, Marz-e Por Gohar, and various ethnic and Monarchist
  organizations; armed political groups that have been almost
  completely repressed by the government include Mujahidin-e Khalq
  Organization (MEK), People's Fedayeen, Democratic Party of Iranian
  Kurdistan, and Komala

Economy Iran


Economy - overview:
  Iran's economy is marked by a bloated, inefficient state sector,
  over reliance on the oil sector, and statist policies that create
  major distortions throughout. Most economic activity is controlled
  by the state. Private sector activity is typically small-scale -
  workshops, farming, and services. President Mahmud AHMADI-NEJAD has
  continued to follow the market reform plans of former President
  RAFSANJANI, with limited progress. Relatively high oil prices in
  recent years have enabled Iran to amass nearly $60 billion in
  foreign exchange reserves, but have not eased economic hardships
  such as high unemployment and inflation. The proportion of the
  economy devoted to the development of weapons of mass destruction
  remains a contentious issue with leading Western nations.

  exploitation and involuntary servitude; according to foreign
  observers, women and girls are trafficked to Pakistan, Turkey, the

  Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Afghanistan are trafficked through Iran en
  route to Persian Gulf states where they are ultimately forced to

  are trafficked to the country for forced marriages and sexual
  exploitation; women and children are also trafficked internally for
  the purposes of forced marriage, sexual exploitation, and

  credible reports of Iranian authorities punishing victims of
  trafficking with beatings, imprisonment, and execution

Illicit drugs:
  despite substantial interdiction efforts, Iran remains a key
  transshipment point for Southwest Asian heroin to Europe; domestic
  narcotics consumption remains a persistent problem and according to
  official Iranian statistics there are at least 2 million drug users
  in the country; lacks anti-money-laundering laws

Introduction Iraq


Background:
  Formerly part of the Ottoman Empire, Iraq was occupied by Britain
  during the course of World War I; in 1920, it was declared a League
  of Nations mandate under UK administration. In stages over the next
  dozen years, Iraq attained its independence as a kingdom in 1932. A
  "republic" was proclaimed in 1958, but in actuality a series of
  military strongmen ruled the country until 2003, the last was SADDAM
  Husayn. Territorial disputes with Iran led to an inconclusive and
  costly eight-year war (1980-88). In August 1990, Iraq seized Kuwait,
  but was expelled by US-led, UN coalition forces during the Gulf War
  of January-February 1991. Following Kuwait's liberation, the UN
  Security Council (UNSC) required Iraq to scrap all weapons of mass
  destruction and long-range missiles and to allow UN verification
  inspections. Continued Iraqi noncompliance with UNSC resolutions
  over a period of 12 years led to the US-led invasion of Iraq in
  March 2003 and the ouster of the SADDAM Husayn regime. Coalition
  forces remain in Iraq under a UNSC mandate, helping to provide
  security and to support the freely elected government. The Coalition
  Provisional Authority, which temporarily administered Iraq after the
  invasion, transferred full governmental authority on 28 June 2004 to
  the Iraqi Interim Government, which governed under the Transitional
  Administrative Law for Iraq (TAL). Under the TAL, elections for a
  275-member Transitional National Assembly (TNA) were held in Iraq on
  30 January 2005. Following these elections, the Iraqi Transitional
  Government (ITG) assumed office. The TNA was charged with drafting
  Iraq's permanent constitution, which was approved in a 15 October
  2005 constitutional referendum. An election under the constitution
  for a 275-member Council of Representatives (CoR) was held on 15
  December 2005. The CoR approval in the selection of most of the
  cabinet ministers on 20 May 2006 marked the transition from the ITG
  to Iraq's first constitutional government in nearly a half-century.

Economy Iraq


Economy - overview:
  Iraq's economy is dominated by the oil sector, which has
  traditionally provided about 95% of foreign exchange earnings.
  Iraq's seizure of Kuwait in August 1990, subsequent international
  economic sanctions, and damage from military action by an
  international coalition beginning in January 1991 drastically
  reduced economic activity. Although government policies supporting
  large military and internal security forces and allocating resources
  to key supporters of the regime hurt the economy, implementation of
  the UN's oil-for-food program, which began in December 1996, helped
  improve conditions for the average Iraqi citizen. Iraq was allowed
  to export limited amounts of oil in exchange for food, medicine, and
  some infrastructure spare parts. In December 1999, the UN Security
  Council authorized Iraq to export under the program as much oil as
  required to meet humanitarian needs. The military victory of the
  US-led coalition in March-April 2003 resulted in the shutdown of
  much of the central economic administrative structure. Although a
  comparatively small amount of capital plant was damaged during the
  hostilities, looting, insurgent attacks, and sabotage have
  undermined efforts to rebuild the economy. Attacks on key economic
  facilities - especially oil pipelines and infrastructure - have
  prevented Iraq from reaching projected export volumes, but total
  government revenues have been higher than anticipated due to high
  oil prices. Despite political uncertainty, Iraq is making some
  progress in building the institutions needed to implement economic
  policy and has concluded a debt reduction agreement with the Paris
  Club and a Standby Arrangement with the IMF. Iraq's economic
  prospects will depend on the government's ability to control
  inflation, to implement structural reforms such as bank
  restructuring, and to develop the private sector.

Introduction Ireland


Background:
  Celtic tribes arrived on the island between 600-150 B.C. Invasions
  by Norsemen that began in the late 8th century were finally ended
  when King Brian BORU defeated the Danes in 1014. English invasions
  began in the 12th century and set off more than seven centuries of
  Anglo-Irish struggle marked by fierce rebellions and harsh
  repressions. A failed 1916 Easter Monday Rebellion touched off
  several years of guerrilla warfare that in 1921 resulted in
  independence from the UK for 26 southern counties; six northern
  (Ulster) counties remained part of the UK. In 1948 Ireland withdrew
  from the British Commonwealth; it joined the European Community in
  1973. Irish governments have sought the peaceful unification of
  Ireland and have cooperated with Britain against terrorist groups. A
  peace settlement for Northern Ireland is being implemented with some
  difficulties. In 2006, the Irish and British governments developed
  and began working to implement the St. Andrew's Agreement, building
  on the Good Friday Agreement approved in 1998.

Economy Ireland


Economy - overview:
  Ireland is a small, modern, trade-dependent economy with growth
  averaging 6% in 1995-2006. Agriculture, once the most important
  sector, is now dwarfed by industry and services. Industry accounts
  for 46% of GDP, about 80% of exports, and 29% of the labor force.
  Although exports remain the primary engine for Ireland's growth, the
  economy has also benefited from a rise in consumer spending,
  construction, and business investment. Per capita GDP is 10% above
  that of the four big European economies and the second highest in
  the EU behind Luxembourg. Over the past decade, the Irish Government
  has implemented a series of national economic programs designed to
  curb price and wage inflation, reduce government spending, increase
  labor force skills, and promote foreign investment. Ireland joined
  in circulating the euro on 1 January 2002 along with 11 other EU
  nations.

Economy Isle of Man


Economy - overview:
  Offshore banking, manufacturing, and tourism are key sectors of the
  economy. The government offers incentives to high-technology
  companies and financial institutions to locate on the island; this
  has paid off in expanding employment opportunities in high-income
  industries. As a result, agriculture and fishing, once the mainstays
  of the economy, have declined in their shares of GDP. The Isle of
  Man also attracts online gambling sites and the film industry. Trade
  is mostly with the UK. The Isle of Man enjoys free access to EU
  markets.

@Israel

Introduction Israel


Background:
  Following World War II, the British withdrew from their mandate of
  Palestine, and the UN partitioned the area into Arab and Jewish
  states, an arrangement rejected by the Arabs. Subsequently, the
  Israelis defeated the Arabs in a series of wars without ending the
  deep tensions between the two sides. The territories Israel occupied
  since the 1967 war are not included in the Israel country profile,
  unless otherwise noted. On 25 April 1982, Israel withdrew from the
  Sinai pursuant to the 1979 Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty. Israel and
  Palestinian officials signed on 13 September 1993 a Declaration of
  Principles (also known as the "Oslo Accords") guiding an interim
  period of Palestinian self-rule. Outstanding territorial and other
  disputes with Jordan were resolved in the 26 October 1994
  Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace. In addition, on 25 May 2000, Israel
  withdrew unilaterally from southern Lebanon, which it had occupied
  since 1982. In keeping with the framework established at the Madrid
  Conference in October 1991, bilateral negotiations were conducted
  between Israel and Palestinian representatives and Syria to achieve
  a permanent settlement. In April 2003, US President BUSH, working in
  conjunction with the EU, UN, and Russia - the "Quartet" - took the
  lead in laying out a roadmap to a final settlement of the conflict
  by 2005, based on reciprocal steps by the two parties leading to two
  states, Israel and a democratic Palestine. However, progress toward
  a permanent status agreement was undermined by Israeli-Palestinian
  violence between September 2003 and February 2005. An
  Israeli-Palestinian agreement reached at Sharm al-Sheikh in February
  2005, along with an internally-brokered Palestinian ceasefire,
  significantly reduced the violence. In the summer of 2005, Israel
  unilaterally disengaged from the Gaza Strip, evacuating settlers and
  its military. The election of HAMAS in January 2006 to head the
  Palestinian Legislative Council froze relations between Israel and
  the Palestinian Authority. Ehud OLMERT became prime minister in
  March 2006; following an Israeli military operation in Gaza in
  June-July 2006, he shelved plans to unilaterally evacuate from most
  of the West Bank. The kidnapping of two Israeli soldiers by Lebanese
  Hizballah led to a 34-day conflict in Lebanon in June-August 2006.

Economy Israel


Economy - overview:
  Israel has a technologically advanced market economy with
  substantial, though diminishing, government participation. It
  depends on imports of crude oil, grains, raw materials, and military
  equipment. Despite limited natural resources, Israel has intensively
  developed its agricultural and industrial sectors over the past 20
  years. Israel imports substantial quantities of grain, but is
  largely self-sufficient in other agricultural products. Cut
  diamonds, high-technology equipment, and agricultural products
  (fruits and vegetables) are the leading exports. Israel usually
  posts sizable trade deficits, which are covered by large transfer
  payments from abroad and by foreign loans. Roughly half of the
  government's external debt is owed to the US, which is its major
  source of economic and military aid. The bitter Israeli-Palestinian
  conflict; difficulties in the high-technology, construction, and
  tourist sectors; and fiscal austerity in the face of growing
  inflation led to small declines in GDP in 2001 and 2002. The economy
  rebounded in 2003-05, growing at a 4% rate each year, as the
  government tightened fiscal policy and implemented structural
  reforms to boost competition and efficiency in the markets. The
  conflict with Lebanon in summer 2006 dampened slightly GDP growth
  estimates for the year, but continuing strong foreign investment,
  tax revenue, and private consumption levels helped the economy
  recover quickly.

  its settlers and military from the Gaza Strip and from four
  settlements in the West Bank in August 2005; Golan Heights is
  Israeli-occupied (Lebanon claims the Shab'a Farms area of Golan
  Heights); since 1948, about 350 peacekeepers from the UN Truce
  Supervision Organization (UNTSO) headquartered in Jerusalem monitor
  ceasefires, supervise armistice agreements, prevent isolated
  incidents from escalating, and assist other UN personnel in the
  region

Refugees and internally displaced persons:
  IDPs: 150,000-420,000 (Arab villagers displaced from homes in
  northern Israel) (2006)

Trafficking in persons:
  current situation: Israel is a destination country for low-skilled
  workers from Eastern Europe and Asia who migrate voluntarily for
  contract labor in the construction, agriculture, and health care
  industries, some of whom are subsequently subjected to conditions of
  involuntary servitude; many labor recruitment agencies in source
  countries and in Israel require workers to pay large up-front fees
  that often lead to debt bondage and vulnerability to forced labor;
  Israel is also a destination country for women trafficked from
  Eastern Europe for the purpose of sexual exploitation
  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Israel is placed on the Tier 2
  Watch List for its failure to provide evidence of increasing efforts
  to address trafficking, namely the conditions of involuntary
  servitude allegedly facing thousands of foreign migrant workers

Illicit drugs:
  increasingly concerned about cocaine and heroin abuse; drugs arrive
  in country from Lebanon and, increasingly, from Jordan;
  money-laundering center

Introduction Italy


Background:
  Italy became a nation-state in 1861 when the regional states of the
  peninsula, along with Sardinia and Sicily, were united under King
  Victor EMMANUEL II. An era of parliamentary government came to a
  close in the early 1920s when Benito MUSSOLINI established a Fascist
  dictatorship. His disastrous alliance with Nazi Germany led to
  Italy's defeat in World War II. A democratic republic replaced the
  monarchy in 1946 and economic revival followed. Italy was a charter
  member of NATO and the European Economic Community (EEC). It has
  been at the forefront of European economic and political
  unification, joining the Economic and Monetary Union in 1999.
  Persistent problems include illegal immigration, organized crime,
  corruption, high unemployment, sluggish economic growth, and the low
  incomes and technical standards of southern Italy compared with the
  prosperous north.

Economy Italy


Economy - overview:
  Italy has a diversified industrial economy with roughly the same
  total and per capita output as France and the UK. This capitalistic
  economy remains divided into a developed industrial north, dominated
  by private companies, and a less-developed, welfare-dependent,
  agricultural south, with 20% unemployment. Most raw materials needed
  by industry and more than 75% of energy requirements are imported.
  Over the past decade, Italy has pursued a tight fiscal policy in
  order to meet the requirements of the Economic and Monetary Unions
  and has benefited from lower interest and inflation rates. The
  current government has enacted numerous short-term reforms aimed at
  improving competitiveness and long-term growth. Italy has moved
  slowly, however, on implementing needed structural reforms, such as
  lightening the high tax burden and overhauling Italy's rigid labor
  market and over-generous pension system, because of the current
  economic slowdown and opposition from labor unions. But the
  leadership faces a severe economic constraint: the budget deficit
  has breached the 3% EU ceiling. The economy experienced low growth
  in 2006, and unemployment remained at a high level.

Introduction Jamaica


Background:
  The island - discovered by Christopher COLUMBUS in 1494 - was
  settled by the Spanish early in the 16th century. The native Taino
  Indians, who had inhabited Jamaica for centuries, were gradually
  exterminated, replaced by African slaves. England siezed the island
  in 1655 and a plantation economy - based on sugar, cocoa, and coffee
  - was established. The abolition of slavery in 1834 freed a quarter
  million slaves, many of which became small farmers. Jamaica
  gradually obtained increasing independence from Britain, and in 1958
  it joined other British Caribbean colonies in forming the Federation
  of the West Indies. Jamaica gained full independence when it
  withdrew from the federation in 1962. Deteriorating economic
  conditions during the 1970s led to recurrent violence as rival gangs
  created by the major political parties evolved into powerful
  organized crime networks involved in international drug smuggling
  and money laundering. The cycle of violence, drugs, and poverty has
  served to impoverish large sectors of the populace. Nonetheless,
  many rural and resort areas remain relatively safe and contribute
  substantially to the economy.

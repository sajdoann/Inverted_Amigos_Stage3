PREFACE


The influence of American Indian song-literature has touched both the
music and the literature of contemporary America. Those writers who use
Indian themes are legion. Mary Austin has gone farthest, perhaps, among
the writers of the day in relating her poetic work to the native rhythms
of America.

These native rhythms pulsed through the songs of our Red Men for
centuries before our Christian era. The very beautiful Aztec and the Inca
poetry belong to the earlier and more highly developed civilizations.
Since it is the purpose of this volume to treat of the more primitive
forms of rhythm, it has seemed best to limit the illustrations to songs
from tribes north of Mexico.

The late Mrs. Natalie Curtis Burlin’s collection of songs in _The
Indians’ Book_ makes that volume quite the most representative source
book for the study of Indian lyrics. The original texts of unusual range
in poetic patterns, the musical settings, the interlinear translations,
and the accompanying narratives add a rich context to free translations
of genuine literary merit.

Among other contributions to Indian song-literature, the studies of
Miss Alice Cunningham Fletcher, Mr. Carlos Troyer, and Doctor Washington
Matthews hold a particular charm for the investigator.

Mrs. Austin’s notable work, _The American Rhythm_, an analysis of the
primitive poetic impulse, with illustrations from her own translations,
came from the press after the writer’s study of Indian poetic rhythms had
been under way for some years. The conclusions for this volume have been
limited, therefore, to those about poetic forms.

The writer is greatly indebted to Mrs. Austin for her generous interest
in earlier work and especially for her helpful criticism of this study.

FOREWORD


The student of poetry in America enjoys an opportunity, such as has
never been practicable for the European student, to come in contact
with the source and mould of poetic form. For in Europe, the overlaying
of all native activity by the sedulously cultivated Greek and Roman
preferences, the deliberate turning of scholarly inquiry _from_ what was
self-sprung and indigenous _toward_ what had been perfected in another
environment and upon other roots, left the whole subject of the origin of
form dangling in the atmosphere of theory and surmise. To this day the
most that we know of the high forms of poesy in Europe is owed less to
authentic tradition than to the scholastic rehumation of native remains
in dance and ritual, of what was once, in the interest of the classic
ideal, discarded and buried, or at the least, permitted to survive only
among the unlettered folk.

Fortunately for our general understanding of poetic form, the Greeks
had no such snobbish scruples as arose later throughout Europe against
admitting the origin of their most majestic poetic medium in the communal
dance around the tribal altar. Here in the United States we are, by
a turn of fortune, undeserved and underappreciated, able to watch the
evolution of poetic form from stages somewhat earlier than those recorded
by Aristotle, going on as an indigenous type of human expression. We are
face to face here with the evolution of lyric form out of the stanzaic
act, ritualistically repeated; with the approach to the ode, along the
path struck out by primitive man in the identification of himself with
the sources of high states of being.

We confront these things as unselfconscious acts, rather than as
fragmentary and over-annotated poetic remains. We are able to refer them
directly to accompanying gestures, to generative social occasions, and
the environmental matrix. And we have to guess or to theorize, where
these things are obligatory, only in reference to minds whose movements
are influenced by factors lying open to intelligent apprehension.

To point this out, by way of introduction to the first thoughtful attempt
to put the material for a valid conclusion as to the origin of poetic
form, in order for the unspecialized reader, is not to subtract anything
from the difficulty of the task, nor to minimize the importance of the
result. So careless has American scholarship been of our rich resources
in this direction, that merely for Miss Barnes to have realized their
richness and to have collected illustrative examples of them from the
widely scattered and occasionally obscure sources, implies not only a
general background of wide literary knowledge, but a fund of literary
intelligence and much industry. It also implies a quality of restraint
not infrequently lacking from such undertakings, in not attempting to
bridge the gaps and supply the missing links by even the most plausible
theory. Such restraint in view of the usual American demand for a
complete tabloid statement, an assumption that does away with the
necessity for further inquiry, is so much the more unusual that some of
the credit for making this inquiry accessible surely devolves not only on
the University in which it could take place, but upon the publisher who
ventures to present it.

Merely by collecting from authentic sources, by discarding doubtful
examples and by intelligent grouping of the best translations of
Amerindian lyrics, according to their formative tendency, Miss Barnes has
done more than perhaps she herself realizes, to uncover the influences at
work on the primitive poetic impulse, to crystallize it into forms best
suited to the expression of a progressively higher poetic content. To one
who reads her simple statement of the relation of sacred numbers, fours
and sixes and sevens, to what Miss Barnes calls the “thought rhythm”
as determining the form of primitive verse, and reads it without other
knowledge of Indians than is included in these pages, it will scarcely
appear that the still profounder influence is the natural environment,
determining the force of climate, landscape line, and food succession
in the cultural life of the particular tribe. But to one familiar with
environmental distinctions between Zuñi and Iroquois and Omaha, there
will be distinctive pleasure in tracing relationships between verse forms
and the known formative features of the given landscape. To such a reader
there will also appear intimate relations between the repetitive pattern
of formal elements, the range and interdependence of dance movements,
and of decorative patterns of beadwork and textiles. It would, in fact,
be very little trouble to accompany each poem in this collection with
an appropriate design either of gesture or decorative elements, drawn
from the life of that tribe, in which the distribution of formative
elements would make a pattern recognizably that of the poem. As for
example, in the Paiute _Lament of a Man for His Son_, the gesture of the
first movement would be that inevitable to a man standing at the head
of his son’s corpse, and striving beyond his grief to descry his son’s
spirit walking the spirit road; the gesture of the second movement, the
reverent, slightly swaying tread of friends bearing the body on their
shoulders over uneven ground; and of the last movement, the final tearing
wrench of human affection. In the same manner, the _Iroquois Hymn_ on the
dissolution of the Great League, carries the gesture of up-flung arms,
and the bowing of heads that dust may be cast upon them; while in the
Navaho and Pueblo Rain Chants, there is the recurrent but always slightly
variable motif of the landscape as the determinant of the verbal pattern,
as you can see on any old Zuñi _tinaja_. It is the precision with which
Miss Barnes makes these things appear to the initiate, without at the
same time obscuring the more obvious conclusions for the average reader,
which distinguishes what she has to say above all other writings on the
subject. No one who reads her notes on Amerindian verse forms need feel
the limitation of personal knowledge a hindrance to his æsthetic and
intellectual enjoyment of the poems themselves.

I know of but one parallel to this achievement in the current
descriptions of aboriginal culture in the United States. That is in
George Bird Grinnell’s account of Cheyenne games, in which, without
saying as much, the relation of all games to man’s aboriginal puzzlement
about the world he lives in is convincingly brought out. Mr. Grinnell’s
account should be read in connection with Miss Barnes’ work for the
further light it throws on the origin of patterns, social, decorative,
or literary, in living human impulses. In so far as any study does this,
and especially as it does it in respect to areas of literary activity
all too scantily familiar, it constitutes an indispensable service to
American scholarship.

AMERICAN INDIAN LOVE LYRICS




PART ONE

INDIAN LOVE LYRICS AND OTHER VERSE SELECTED FROM THE SONGS OF THE NORTH
AMERICAN INDIANS


MY BARK CANOE (_Ojibwa_)

    In the still night, the long night through,
    I guide my bark canoe,
    My love, to you.
    While the stars shine, and falls the dew,
    I seek my love in bark canoe—
    I seek for you.
    It is I, love, your lover true,
    Who glides the stream in bark canoe.
    It glides to you,
    My love, to you.


HER SHADOW (_Ojibwa_)

    Out on the lake my canoe is gliding,
    Paddle dipping soft lest she should take alarm;
    Ah, hey-ah hey-ah ho, hey-ah hey-ah ho, thus I go!
    Somewhere along shore she is hiding,
    She is shy to yield to love’s alluring charm;
    Ah, hey-ah hey-ah ho, hey-ah hey-ah, love will win, I know.
    There is a shadow swiftly stealing!
    Should it be her own, soon I will win the race;
    Ah hey-ah hey-ah ho, hey-ah hey-ah ho, I think it is!
    Will she but turn, herself revealing,
    I will shout aloud when-e’er I see her face.
    Ah! hey-ah hey-ah ho, hey-ah hey-ah ho,
    There she is!


LOVER’S WOOING or BLANKET SONG (_Zuñi_)

I

    O what happiness!
    How delightful,
    When together we
    ’Neath one blanket walk.
    We together
    ’Neath one blanket walk,
    We together
    ’Neath one blanket walk,
    We walk.
    O! What happiness!
    How delightful,
    When together we
    ’Neath one blanket walk.
    We together,
    ’Neath one blanket walk,
    We together,
    ’Neath one blanket walk,
    We walk.

II

    Can it be that
    My young maiden fair
    Sits awaiting,
    All alone tonight?
    Is she waiting
    For me only?
    Is she waiting
    For me only?

III

    May I hope it is
    My young maiden
    Sitting all alone
    And awaiting me;
    Will she come then?
    Will she walk with me?
    ’Neath one blanket
    We together be,
    We—we two, we two,
    We two, we two—
    Will she come?


PAPAGO LOVE SONG (_Papago_)

    Early I rose
    In the blue morning;
    My love was up before me,
    It came running to me from the doorways of the Dawn.

    On Papago Mountain
    The dying quarry
    Looked at me with my love’s eyes.


LOVE SONG (_Dakota_)

    Many are the youths, many youths:
    Thou alone art he who pleaseth me.
    Over all I love thee.
    Long shall be the years of parting!


THE BRIDE’S SONG (_Algonquin_)

    There are many men in the world,
    But only one is dear to me.
    He is good and brave and strong.
    He swore to love none but me;
    He has forgotten me.
    It was an evil spirit that changed him,
    But I will love none but him.


LONELY (_Ojibwa_)

    Fear not, he sayeth,
    Though far away,
    Thy lover strayeth
    At break of day.
    “Go not, my sweetheart,”
    Vainly I cry,
    “To yon far island,”
    Yearning I sigh.
    Thither must I go,
    Sadly I moan;
    Heavy my woe,
    Left here alone.


WAR SONG (_Dakota_)

    Friend, whatever hardships threaten,
    If thou call me,
    I’ll befriend thee;
    All enduring fearlessly,
    I’ll befriend thee.


ONONDAGA HYMN (_Iroquois_)

    Woe! Woe!
    Hearken ye!
    We are diminished!
    Woe! Woe!
    The cleared land has become a thicket.

    Woe! Woe!
    The cleared places are deserted.

    Woe!
    They are in their graves—
    They who established it—
    Woe!
    The great League.
    Yet they declared
    It should endure—
    The great League.
    Woe!
    Their work has grown old.
    Woe!
    Thus we are become miserable.


LAMENT OF A MAN FOR HIS SON (_Paiute_)

    Son, my son!
    I will go up to the mountain
    And there I will light a fire
    To the feet of my son’s spirit,
    And there will I lament him;
    Saying,
    O my son,
    What is my life to me, now you are departed!

    Son, my son,
    In the deep earth
    We softly laid thee
    In a Chief’s robe,
    In a warrior’s gear.
    Surely there,
    In the spirit land
    Thy deeds attend thee!
    Surely,
    The corn comes to the ear again!
    But I, here,
    I am the stalk that the seed-gatherers
    Descrying empty, afar, left standing.
    Son, my son!
    What is my life to me, now you are departed?


DEATH OF TALUTA (_Siouan_)

    Ah, spirit, thy flight is mysterious!
    While the clouds are stirred by our wailing,
    And our tears fall faster in sorrow—

    While the cold sweat of night benumbs us,
    Thou goest alone on thy journey—
    In the midst of the shining star people!

    Thou goest alone on thy journey—
    Thy memory shall be our portion;
    Until death we shall watch for the spirit.


WIND SONG (_Kiowa_)

    O you warriors, you have loved ones
    Longing for you, longing for you;
    Rich are ye.
    O you lovers, you have maidens
    Longing for you; none have I.
    Wherefore droop ye in silence, so downcast?
    Cheer your hearts with song, ho!


BLUEBIRD SONG (_Pima_)

    _Hai-ya, hai-ya,—hai-ya, hai-ya_—
    All my song is lost and gone.
    Sad at heart is the bluebird,
    All my song is lost and gone,
    Woe is me, alas! alas!
    All my song is lost and gone!


SONG OF THE UNHAPPY WIFE (_Dakota_)

    Sorely I am distressed;
    Sorely I am distressed;
    Sorely I am distressed.
    The earth alone continues long;
    I speak as one not expecting to live,
    Sorely I am distressed;
    The earth alone continues long.


THE SONG OF UKIABI (_Cegiha_)

    I am walking to and fro!
    I can find nothing which can heal my sorrow.


A LOVER’S LAMENT (_Tewa_)

    My little breath, under the willows by the water-side we used to sit,
    And there the yellow cottonwood bird came and sang.
    That I remember and therefore I weep.
    Under the growing corn we used to sit,
    And there the little leaf bird came and sang.
    That I remember and therefore I weep.
    There on the meadow of yellow flowers we used to walk.
    Oh, my little breath! Oh, my little heart!
    There on the meadow of blue flowers we used to walk.
    Alas! how long ago that we two walked in that pleasant way.
    Then everything was happy, but, alas! how long ago.
    There on the meadow of crimson flowers we used to walk.
    Oh, my little breath, now I go there alone in sorrow.


MY HOME OVER THERE (_Tewa_)

    My home over there, my home over there,
    My home over there, now I remember it!
    And when I see that mountain far away,
    Why, then I weep. Alas! what can I do?
    What can I do? Alas! What can I do?
    My home over there, now I remember it!


HUNTING-SONG (_Navaho_)

        Comes the deer to my singing,
        Comes the deer to my song,
        Comes the deer to my singing.

    He, the blackbird, he am I,
    Bird beloved of the wild deer.
        Comes the deer to my singing.

    From the Mountain Black,
    From the summit,
    Down the trail, coming, coming now,
        Comes the deer to my singing.

    Through the blossoms,
    Through the flowers, coming, coming now
        Comes the deer to my singing.

    Through the flower dew-drops,
        Coming, coming now,
        Comes the deer to my singing.

    Through the pollen, flower pollen,
        Coming, coming now,
        Comes the deer to my singing.

    Starting with his left fore-foot,
    Stamping, turns the frightened deer.
        Comes the deer to my singing.

    Quarry mine, blessed am I
    In the luck of the chase.
        Comes the deer to my singing.

        Comes the deer to my singing,
        Comes the deer to my song,
        Comes the deer to my singing.


A SONG OF THE DEER CEREMONY (_San Carlos Apache_)

    At the east,
    Where the jet ridges of the earth lie....

    At the south,
    Where the white shell ridges of the earth lie,
    Where all kinds of fruit are ripe,
    We two will meet.

    From there where the coral ridges of the earth lie,
    We two will meet.
    Where the ripe fruits are fragrant,
    We two will meet.


MOUNT KOONAK: A SONG OF ARSUT (_Eskimaun_)

    I look toward the south, to great Mount Koonak,
    To great Mount Koonak, there to the south;
    I watch the clouds that gather round him;
    I contemplate their shining brightness;
    They spread abroad upon great Koonak;
    They climb up his seaward flanks;
    See how they shift and change;
    Watch them there to the south;
    How one makes beautiful the other;
    How they mount his southern slopes,
    Hiding him from the stormy sea,
    Each lending beauty to the other.


THE COYOTE AND THE LOCUST (_Zuñi_)

    Locust, locust, playing a flute,
    Locust, locust, playing a flute!
    Away up on the pine-tree bough,
    Closely clinging,
        Playing a flute,
        Playing a flute!


KA-NI-GA SONG

    The poor little bee
    That lives in the tree,
    The poor little bee
    That lives in the tree
    Has only one arrow
    In his quiver.


CORN-GRINDING SONG II (_Laguna_)

    Butterflies, butterflies,
    Now fly away to the blossoms,
    Fly, blue-wing,
    Fly, yellow-wing,
    Now fly away to the blossoms,
    Fly, red-wing,
    Fly white-wing,
    Now fly away to the blossoms,
    Butterflies, away!
    Butterflies, butterflies,
    Now fly away to the blossoms,
    Butterflies, away!


SONG TO THE TREES AND STREAMS (_Pawnee_)

I

    Dark against the sky, yonder distant line
    Lies before us. Trees we see, long the line of trees,
    Bending, swaying in the breeze.

II

    Bright with flashing light yonder distant line
    Runs before us, swiftly runs, swift the river runs,
    Winding, flowing over the land.

III

    Hark! O hark! A sound, yonder distant sound
    Comes to greet us, singing comes, soft the river’s song,
    Rippling gently beneath the trees.


SONG TO THE MOUNTAINS (_Pawnee_)

I

    Mountains loom upon the path we take;
    Yonder peak now rises sharp and clear;
    Behold! It stands with its head uplifted,
    Thither we go, since our way lies there.

II

    Mountains loom upon the path we take;
    Yonder peak now rises sharp and clear;
    Behold! We climb, drawing near its summit;
    Steeper grows the way and slow our steps.

III

    Mountains loom upon the path we take;
    Yonder peak that rises sharp and clear,
    Behold us now on its head uplifted;
    Planting there our feet, we stand secure.

IV

    Mountains loom upon the path we take;
    Yonder peak that rose so sharp and clear,
    Behold us now on its head uplifted;
    Resting there at last we sing our song.


RITUAL SONG (_Pawnee_)

I

    Over the prairie flits, in ever widening circles, the shadow of a bird
      about me as I walk;
    Upward turn my eyes, _Kawas_ looks upon me, she turns with flapping
      wings, and far away she flies.

II

    Round about a tree, in ever widening circles, an eagle flies, alertly
      watching over his nest;
    Loudly whistles he, a challenge sending far; over the country wide it
      echoes, there defying foes.


WIND SONG (_Pima_)

    Far on the desert ridges
    Stands the cactus;
    Lo, the blossoms swaying
    To and fro, the blossoms swaying, swaying.


A SONG OF SPRING (_Chippewa_)

    As my eyes search the prairie,
    I feel the summer in the spring.


THE DARKNESS SONG FROM THE INVITATION RITE (_Iroquois_)

(The chief of the Invitation Rite requests all the night folk of the
forest to protect his people on their journey to the morning.)

    We wait in the darkness!
    Come, all ye who listen,
    Help in our night journey:
    Now no sun is shining;
    Now no star is glowing;
    Come show us the pathway:
    The night is not friendly;
    She closes her eyelids;
    The moon has forgot us,
    We wait in the darkness!


THE INVITATION SONG


Part I (_The Song of the Whip-poor-will announced by the flute._)

I

    So says the whip-poor-will,
    Follow me, follow me!
    So says the chief to him,
    Yes I will follow thee!

II

    See the night darkening;
    The shadows are hiding,
    No light to follow for,
    So says the waterfall,
    So sings the river voice!

III

    Someone is nearing me,
    Soft he comes creeping here,
    Two eyes glare close to me,
    Lighting the forest path—
    Hear how his breath blows by!

IV

    Fol-low me, fol-low me,
    So sings the whip-poor-will!
    Yes, I am following,
    So the chief answers him.


Part II (_The Wolf and his mate are announced._)

I

    Hark, the trees bending low,
    Something is breaking them,
    Not the strong north wind’s hand,
    Something stalks broad and swift.
    Snuffing and panting loud!

II

    Hark! How the tangles break!
    Fearless the footfalls pass,
    Strong trees stretch far apart,
    Great horns dividing them.
        (Whip-poor-will chorus)


Part III (_Buck and Doe with cries enter the room._)

I

    How the cold shivers me!
    No snow is falling now,
    Where does the sun’s fire hide?
    Something comes roaring loud
    Swift footed, warning me!

II

    Its breath blinds the night eyes,
    Like rainy vapor falls!
    Now it walks close to me,
    Warming and coaxing me,
    Where the black forest frowns.
        (Whip-poor-will chorus)


Part IV (_The Bear and his mate have come._)

I

    How the wind travels now,
    No one dares run with it.
    Great trees bend low to it,
    Rivers fight back to it,
    Roaring and splashing it!

II

    Hear its wings flapping strong
    Far in the hidden skies!
    Swift it flies northward high,
    Whistling and calling loud,
    Hunting its running prey!

(The Hawk and its mate are announced, and all the rest of the forest
folk. Finally, at dawn, the eagle is announced by the flute.)


Part V (_The Eagle Song_)

I

    Deep the dew water falls
    No one comes close to me!
    Where are you, whip-poor-will?
    Why I am waiting now
    Calling your voice again?

II

    Screaming the night away,
    With his great wing feathers
    Swooping the darkness up;
    I hear the Eagle bird
    Pulling the blanket back
    Off from the eastern sky.

III

    How swift he flies bearing the sun to the morning.
    See how he sits down in the trails of the eastern sky!
    Whip-poor-will, Whip-poor-will, no more I follow thee!
    When the night comes again, wilt thou say, “Follow me”?


THE PLANTING SONG (_Osage_)

    I have made a footprint, a sacred one.
    I have made a footprint; through it the blades push upward.
    I have made a footprint; through it the blades radiate.
    I have made a footprint; over it the blades float in the wind.
    I have made a footprint; over it the ears lean toward one another.
    I have made a footprint; over it I pluck the ears.
    I have made a footprint; over it I bend the stalk to pluck the ears.
    I have made a footprint; over it the blossoms lie gray.
    I have made a footprint; smoke arises from my house.
    I have made a footprint; there is cheer in my house.
    I have made a footprint; I live in the light of day.


SONG OF THE RAIN CHANT (_Navaho_)

    Far as man can see,
        Comes the rain,
        Comes the rain with me.

    From the Rain-Mount,
    Rain-Mount far away,
        Comes the rain,
        Comes the rain with me.

    ’Mid the lightnings,
    ’Mid the lightning zigzag,
    ’Mid the lightning flashing,
        Comes the rain,
        Comes the rain with me.

    ’Mid the swallows,
    ’Mid the swallows blue
    Chirping glad together,
        Comes the rain,
        Comes the rain with me.

    Through the pollen,
    Through the pollen blest,
    All in pollen hidden
        Comes the rain,
        Comes the rain with me.

    Far as man can see,
        Comes the rain,
        Comes the rain with me.


THE VOICE THAT BEAUTIFIES THE LAND (_Navaho_)

I

    The voice that beautifies the land!
    The voice above,
    The voice of the thunder,
    Among the dark clouds
    Again and again it sounds,
    The voice that beautifies the land.

II

    The voice that beautifies the land!
    The voice below,
    The voice of the grasshopper,
    Among the flowers and grasses
    Again and again it sounds,
    The voice that beautifies the land.


CORN-GRINDING SONG (_Tesuque Pueblo_)

I

    This way from the North
    Comes the cloud,
    Very blue,
    And inside the cloud is the blue corn.
        How beautiful the cloud
        Bringing corn of blue color!

II

    This way from the West
    Comes the cloud
    Very yellow,
    And inside the cloud is the yellow corn.
        How beautiful the cloud
        Bringing corn of yellow color!

III

    This way from the South
    Comes the cloud
    Very red,
    And inside the cloud is the red corn.
        How beautiful the cloud
        Bringing corn of red color!

IV

    This way from the East
    Comes the cloud,
    Very white,
    And inside the cloud is the white corn.
        How beautiful the cloud
        Bringing corn of white color!

    How beautiful the clouds
    From the North and the West
    From the South and the East
    Bringing corn of all colors!


SONG OF THE BLUE CORN DANCE (_Zuñi_)

    Beautiful, lo, the summer clouds,
    Beautiful, lo, the summer clouds!
    Blossoming clouds in the sky,
    Like unto shimmering flowers,
    Blossoming clouds in the sky,
    Onward, lo, they come,
    Hither, hither bound!


CORN-GRINDING SONG (_Zuñi_)

    Yonder, yonder see the fair rainbow,
    See the rainbow brightly decked and painted!
    Now the swallow bringeth glad news to your corn,
    Singing, “Hitherward, hitherward, hitherward, rain,
            Hither come!”
    Singing, “Hitherward, hitherward, hitherward, white cloud,
            Hither come!”
    Now we hear the corn-plants murmur,
            “We are growing everywhere!”
            Hi, yai, the world, how fair!


CORN DANCE SONG (_Zuñi_)

    Who, ah ye know who—
    Who, ah ye know who—
    Who was’t that made a picture the first?
    It was the bright Rainbow Youth,
            Rainbow Youth—
    Ay, behold it was even thus—
            Clouds came,
            And rain came
            Close following—
    Rainbow then colored all!


KOROSTA KATZINA SONG (_Hopi_)

I

        Yellow butterflies
    Over the blossoming virgin corn,
        With pollen-painted faces
    Chase one another in brilliant throng.

II

        Blue butterflies
    Over the blossoming virgin beans,
        With pollen-painted faces
    Chase one another in brilliant streams.

III

        Over the blossoming corn,
        Over the virgin corn
        Wild bees hum;
        Over the blossoming corn,
        Over the virgin beans
        Wild bees hum.

IV

    Over your field of growing corn
    All day shall hang the thunder-cloud;
    Over your field of growing corn
    All day shall come the rushing rain.


ANGA KATZINA SONG (_Hopi_)

    Rain all over the cornfields,
      Pretty butterfly-maidens
    Chasing one another when the rain is done,
      Hither, thither, so.
    How they frolic ’mid the corn,
      Laughing, laughing, thus:
        A-ha, ha-ha,
          O-ah, e-lo!
    How they frolic ’mid the corn,
      Singing, singing, thus:
        O-o, o-ho,
        O-he, e-lo!


HE-HEA KATZINA SONG (_Hopi_)

    Corn-blossom maidens
    Here in the fields,
    Patches of beans in flower,
    Fields all abloom,
    Water shining after rain,
    Blue clouds looming above.

    Now behold!
    Through bright clusters of flowers
    Yellow butterflies
    Are chasing at play,
    And through the blossoming beans
    Blue butterflies
    Are chasing at play.


WUWUCHIM CHANT (_Hopi_)

    Thus we, thus we,
    The night along,
    With happy hearts
    Wish well one another.

    In the chief’s kiva
    They, the fathers,
    They and Muyingwa
    Plant the double ear—
    Plant the perfect double corn-ear.
    So the fields shall shine
    With tassels white of perfect corn-ears.

    Hither to them, hither come,
    Rain that stands and cloud that rushes!


A RAIN SONG OF THE SNAKE SOCIETY—I (_Sia_)

    Priests of _tinia_,
    Let the white floating clouds,
    The clouds like the plains,
    The lightning, thunder, rainbow, and cloud peoples water the earth.
    Let the people of the white floating clouds,
    The people of the clouds like the plains,
    The lightning, thunder, rainbow, and cloud peoples
    Come and work for us and water the earth.


A RAIN SONG OF THE SNAKE SOCIETY—II (_Sia_)

    Cloud priest who ascends through the heart of the spruce of the north,
    Cloud priest who ascends through the heart of the pine of the west,
    Cloud priest who ascends through the heart of the oak of the south,
    Cloud priest who ascends through the heart of the aspen of the east,
    Cloud priest who ascends through the heart of the cedar of the zenith,
    Cloud priest who ascends through the heart of the oak of the nadir,
    Send your people to work for us
    That the water of the six great springs may quicken the earth,
    That she may give to us the fruits of her being.

    Is it not beautiful?
    Is it not, truly!

    Is it not beautiful?
    Is it not, truly!

    Is it not beautiful?
    Is it not, truly!

    Is it not beautiful?
    Is it not, truly!

    Is it not beautiful?
    Is it not, truly!

    On every side They are,
    The Trues, the rain-commanders;
    Do you not hear their drum?
    Because of that you will see
    This year the vapor floating;
    Because of that you will see
    This year the drizzling rain.

    Is it not beautiful?
    Is it not truly!
    In all the fields the corn upspringing,
    Like the young pine it comes up;
    Like the green aspen;
    In all the fields the corn upspringing,
    Tall like the tail of the thrush!
    Tall like the road-runner’s tail,
    In all the fields the corn upspringing!

(Refrain of three lines of vocables.)


FLUTE SONG (_Hopi_)

I

    Hail, fathers, hail!
    Chieftain of the Gray Flute, hail!
    At the four world-points
    Ye call, ye summon clouds.
    From the four world-points upstarting,
    Shall the rain hither come.

II

    Hither thunder, rain-thunder here,
    Hither the rain-thunder will come;
    Hither rain, moving-rain—
    Onward now, over all the fields,
    Moving-rain.
    And the wet earth, amid the corn,
    Everywhere, far and near,
    It will shine—water-shine.


THE SUNRISE CALL (_Zuñi_)

I

    Wake ye, arise, ever watchful be.
    Mother Life-god, she is calling thee!
    Mother Life-god, she is calling thee!
    Mother Life-god, she is greeting thee.
    All arise, arise, arise!
    Rise! arise, arise!

    Mighty Sun-god! give thy light to us,
    Let it guide us, let it aid us.
    See it rise! See it rise!
    How the heart glows, how the soul delights
    In the music of the sunlight.
    Watch it rise! Watch it rise!

HYMN TO THE SUN (_Zuñi_)

I

    Early in the morning,
    We waken, we waken.
    When mother Sun-god rises,
    We welcome her with joy.
    She greets us with a radiant face,
    She meets us with a warm embrace,
    So sweetly, so sweetly.
    Merrily we sing and dance;
    In happy spirit we advance;
    Merrily we sing and dance;
    In happy spirit we advance.
    We are children of the sun,
    Arm in arm together run,
    Round a ring we steady move:
    Our hearts will faithful prove,
    As the sun comes near to us,
    Near to us, near to us.
    Listen! just listen!

II

    What a wondrous shower of sounds,
    Countless beats in rapid rounds,
    Ever changing ever new,
    Constant strains of high and low.
    They are messengers of love,
    Spirit voices from above,
    Bringing light and life and joy
    Telling us of bliss on high,
    Bliss on high! Bliss on high!
    Listen! just listen!

III

    Whence come all these distant sounds?
    Echoes, where the light abounds:
    Crystal streams in murmurs faint,
    Bursting forth without restraint.
    They are golden grains of thought,
    Silent whispers faintly caught,
    Filling us with joy content,
    Pathways of our souls’ ascent,
    Souls’ ascent, souls’ ascent.
    Listen! just listen!

IV

    Glory to the sunlight rays,
    Glory to the Sun-god’s ways,
    Sunlight rays, Sun-god’s ways.
    They command us: to endure,
    To be silent, chaste and pure,
    To be faithful, true and brave,
    To the laws our fathers gave.
    O harken to the Sun-god’s voice
    Beckoning your soul to rise:
    In radiant light, the source of song,
    The origin of thought has sprung:
    As light and song in one unite,
    Let us forever seek the light,
    We seek the light, we seek the light.
    Listen! just listen!


SUNSET SONG (_Zuñi_)

    Goodnight to thee, Fair Goddess,
    We thank thee for thy blessing.
    Goodnight to thee, Fair Goddess,
    We thank thee for this day.

    At early dawn again.
    We thank thee for thy blessing,
    To be with us this day.
    This day,
    We thank thee for this day.


INVOCATION TO THE SUN-GOD (_Zuñi_)

    Grant, O Sun-god, thy protection!
    Guard this helpless infant sleeping.
    Grant, O Sun-god, thy protection!
    Guard this helpless infant sleeping,
    Resting peaceful, resting peaceful.
    Starry guardians forever joyful,
    Faithful Moon-god forever watchful.
    Grant, O Sun-god, thy protection!
    Guard this helpless infant sleeping.
    Spirit living, Spirit resting,
    Guard us, lead us, aid us, love us.
    Sun-god forever, Spirit living, Spirit resting,
    Guard us, lead us, aid us, love us,
    Sun-god forever.


A SONG OF GOTAL LIII (_Mescalero Apache_)

    The black turkey-gobbler, under the East, the middle of his tail;
      toward us it is about to dawn.
    The black turkey-gobbler, the tips of his beautiful tail; above us the
      dawn whitens.
    The black turkey-gobbler, the tips of his beautiful tail; above us the
      dawn becomes yellow.
    The sunbeams stream forward, dawn boys, with shimmering shoes of
      yellow;
    On top of the sunbeams that stream toward us they are dancing.
    At the East the rainbow moves forward, dawn maidens, with shimmering
      shoes and shirts of yellow dance over us.
    Beautifully over us it is dawning.
    Above us among the mountains the herbs are becoming green;
    Above us on the tops of the mountains the herbs are becoming yellow.
    Above us among the mountains, with shoes of yellow I go around the
      fruits and herbs that shimmer.
    Above us among the mountains, the shimmering fruits with shoes and
      shirts of yellow are bent toward him.
    On the beautiful mountains above it is daylight.


FIRST DAYLIGHT SONG (_Navaho_)

I

    The curtain of daybreak is hanging,
    The Daylight Boy (it is hanging),
    From the land of day it is hanging;
    Before him, as it dawns, it is hanging.
    Behind him, as it dawns, it is hanging.
    Before him, in beauty, it is hanging;
    Behind him, in beauty, it is hanging;
    From his voice, in beauty, it is hanging.

II

    The Daylight Girl (it is hanging),
    From the land of yellow light, it is hanging;
    Before her, as it dawns, it is hanging;
    Behind her, as it dawns, it is hanging.
    Before her, in beauty, it is hanging;
    Behind her, in beauty, it is hanging;
    From her voice, in beauty, it is hanging.


SONG OF THE DAWN BOY (_Navaho_)

    Where my kindred dwell, there I wander.
    Child of the White Corn am I, there I wander.
    The Red Rock House, there I wander.
    Where dark _kethawns_ are at the doorway, there I wander.
    At the _yuni_, the striped cotton hangs with pollen. There I wander,
    Going around with it. There I wander.
    Taking another, I depart with it. With it I wander.
    In the house of long life, there I wander.
    In the house of happiness, there I wander.
    Beauty before me, with it I wander.
    Beauty behind me, with it I wander,
    Beauty below me, with it I wander,
    Beauty above me, with it I wander.
    Beauty all around me, with it I wander,
    In old age traveling, with it I wander.
    On the beautiful trail I am, with it I wander.


THE MORNING STAR AND THE NEW BORN DAWN (_Pawnee_)

I

    O Morning Star, for thee we watch!
    Dimly comes thy light from distant skies;
    We see thee, then lost art thou,
    Morning Star, thou bringest life to us.

II

    O Morning Star, thy form we see!
    Clad in shining garments dost thou come,
    Thy plume touched with rosy light.
    Morning Star, thou now art vanishing.

III

    O youthful Dawn, for thee we watch!
    Dimly comes thy light from distant skies;
    We see thee, then lost art thou.
    Youthful Dawn, thou bringest life to us.

IV

    O youthful Dawn, we see thee come!
    Bright grows thy glowing light
    As near, nearer thou dost come.
    Youthful Dawn, thou now art vanishing.


DAYLIGHT (_Pawnee_)

I

    Day is here! Day is here, is here!
    Arise, my son, lift thine eyes,
    Day is here! Day is here, is here!
    Day is here! Day is here, is here!
    Look up, my son, and see the day.
    Day is here! Day is here, is here!

II

    Lo, the deer! Lo, the deer, the deer
    Comes from her covert of the night!
    Day is here! Day is here, is here!
    Lo, the deer! Lo, the deer, the deer!
    All creatures wake and see the light.
    Day is here! Day is here, is here!
    Day is here! Day is here, is here!


THE BIRTH OF DAWN (_Pawnee_)

I

    Awake, O mother, from sleep!
    Awake! the night is far spent;
    The signs of dawn are now seen
    In east, whence cometh new life.

II

    The mother wakens from sleep;
    She wakes, for night is far spent;
    The signs of dawn are now seen
    In east, whence cometh new life.

III

    Awake, O _Kawas_, from sleep!
    Awake! The night is far spent;
    The signs of dawn are now seen
    In east, whence cometh new life.

IV

    Now _Kawas_ wakens from sleep,
    Awakens for night is far spent;
    The signs of dawn are now seen
    In east, whence cometh new life.

V

    Then _Kawas_ stands and speaks forth:
    “A child from Night is now born;
    _Tirá wa_, father on high,
    On Darkness moving, brings Dawn.”

VI

    I understand now, I know
    A child from Night has been born;
    _Tirá wa_, father on high,
    On Darkness moving, brings Dawn.

VII

    O Son, awaken from sleep
    Awake! the night is far spent;
    The signs of dawn are now seen
    In east, whence cometh new life.

VIII

    The Son awakens from sleep;
    He wakes, for night is far spent;
    The signs of dawn are now seen
    In east, whence cometh new life.


SONG TO THE PLEIADES (_Pawnee_)

    Look as they rise, rise
    Over the line where sky meets the earth;
    Pleiades!
    Lo! They ascending, come to guide us,
    Leading us safely, keeping us one;
    Pleiades,
    Teach us to be, like you, united.


THE SONG OF THE STARS (_Algonquin_)

    We are the stars which sing,
    We sing with our light;
    We are the birds of fire,
    We fly over the sky.
    Our light is a voice;
    We make a road for spirits,
    For the spirits to pass over.
    Among us are three hunters
    Who chase a bear;
    There never was a time
    When they were not hunting.
    We look down on the mountains.
    This is the Song of the Stars.


THE STARS DEHN-DEK AND MAH-OH-RAH (_Wyandot_)

    Dehn-dek (_to Oh-tsch-eh-stah, the mother_):
        She arises from the ground!
        In a far land Mah-oh-rah walks before us!
        She comes to the great city and stands before its gates!
        Our Grandmother looks upon her! She who fell down from heaven,
          ... lies upon her couch and beholds Mah-oh-rah.
        She goes to the Land of Little People; she goes through the old
          city in which our fathers were saved.
        Get thee down in haste and bring her again to her own people.

    (_Journeys forth to the city of Our Grandmother._)

    (_Enters the royal palace in the sacred city._)

    Dehn-dek (_to Our Grandmother_):
        Give again into my arms the daughter gone to the Land of the
          Little People!
        She stood here in this hour, but is gone on the lonely way to that
          land.
        Your children mourn for her; they cut themselves for grief!
        Let her return with me to our own land.

    Our Grandmother:
        Mah-oh-rah stood indeed before me!
        She was pale and faint from the journey!
        The Hooh-kehs drew her back in their power!
        She went out from my presence to return to her own people.
        Two torches she bore aloft to make clear the way.

    (_Dehn-dek goes out in pursuit of his daughter._)

    Our Grandmother (_watching the pursuit_):
        They go into the sky!
        From that land are we cast down forever!
        And another land is made for us.
        Let them be made stars.
        Now shall they be made stars to shine forever there.
        And their journey shall never cease!


SONG OF THE MASKED DANCERS (_Apache_)

    The day broke with slender rain.
    The place which is called “lightning’s water stands,”
    The place which is called “where the dawn strikes,”
    Four places where it is called “it dawns with life,”
    I landed there.
    I went among the sky youths.
    One came to me with long life.
    When he talked over my body with the longest life,
    The voice of the thunder spoke well four times,
    He spoke four times to me with life.
    Holy sky youth spoke to me four times.
    When he talked to me my breath became.


A SONG OF THE MASKED DANCERS III (_Apache_)

    The living sky black-spotted;
    The living sky blue-spotted;
    The living sky yellow-spotted;
    The living sky white-spotted;
    The young spruce as girls stood up for their dance in the way of life.
    When my songs first were, they made my songs with words of jet.
    Earth when it was made,
    Sky when it was made,
    Earth to the end,
    Sky to the end,
    Black gans, black thunder, when they came toward each other,
    The various bad things that used to be vanished;
    The bad wishes which were in the world vanished.
    The lightning of the black thunder struck four times for them.
    It struck four times for me.


EMERGENCE SONG (_Pima_)

    Together we emerge with our rattles;
    Together we emerge with our rattles,
    Bright-hued feathers in our head-dresses.
        With our nyñnyirsa we went down;
        With our nyñnyirsa we went down,
        Wearing _Yoku_ feathers in our head-dresses.
    This is the white land; we arrive singing,
    Head-dresses waving in the breeze.
    We have come! We have come!
    The land trembles with our dancing and singing.
      On these black mountains all are singing.
        Head-dresses waving, head-dresses waving.
        We all rejoice! We all rejoice!
        Singing, dancing, the mountains trembling.


THE WARNING OF THE FLOOD (_Pima_)

    Weep my unfortunate people!
        All this you will see take place.
    Weep my unfortunate people!
        For the waters will cover the land.
    Weep my unhappy relatives!
        You will learn all.
    Weep my unhappy relatives!
        You will learn all.
        The waters will cover the mountains.

    Weep my unfortunate people!
        All this you will see take place.
    Weep my unfortunate people!
        For the waters will cover the land.

SONG OF NAYENEZGANI I (_Navaho_)

I

    The Slayer of the Alien Gods,
    That now am I.

    Arises with me,
    Journeys with me,
    Goes down with me,
    Abides with me;
    But sees me not.

II

    Child of the Water

SONG OF NAYENEZGANI II (_Navaho_)

I

    I am the Child of the Water.
    Where’er I roam
    Behind me
    Waters white are strewn around.

SONG OF THE HORSE (_Navaho_)

      How joyous his neigh!
    Lo, the Turquoise Horse of Johano-ai,
      How joyous his neigh!
    There on precious hides outspread standeth he;
      How joyous his neigh,
    There on tips of fair fresh flowers feedeth he;
      How joyous his neigh,
    There of mingled waters holy drinketh he;
      How joyous his neigh,
    There he spurneth dust of glittering grains;
      How joyous his neigh,
    There in mist of sacred pollen hidden, all hidden he;
      How joyous his neigh,
    There his offspring many grow and thrive for evermore:
      How joyous his neigh!


SONG OF THE HOGANS (_Navaho_)

    Lo, yonder the hogan,

      The hogan,
      The hogan blessed.

WAR-SONG (_Navaho_)

        Lo, the flint youth, he am I,
            The flint youth.

    _Nayenezrani_, Lo, behold me, he am I,
        Lo, the flint youth, he am I,
            The flint youth.

    Moccasins of black flint have I;
        Lo, the flint youth, he am I,
            The flint youth.

    Leggings of black flint have I;
        Lo, the flint youth, he am I,
            The flint youth.

    Tunic of black flint have I;
        Lo, the flint youth, he am I,
            The flint youth.

    Bonnet of black flint have I;
        Lo, the flint youth, he am I,
            The flint youth.

    Clearest, purest flint the heart
    Living strong within me—heart of flint;
        Lo, the flint youth, he am I,
            The flint youth.

    Now the zig-zag lightnings four
            From me flash,
    Striking and returning,
            From me flash;
        Lo, the flint youth, he am I,
            The flint youth.

    There where’er the lightnings strike,
    Into the ground they hurl the foe—
    Ancient folk with evil charms,
    One upon another, dashed to earth;
        Lo, the flint youth, he am I,
            The flint youth.

    Living evermore,
    Feared of all forevermore,
        Lo, the flint youth, he am I,
            The flint youth.

    Lo, the flint youth, he am I,
            The flint youth.


ATSÁLĒI YEDADIGLÉS (_Navaho_)

    Now the holy one paints his form.
    The Wind Boy, the holy one, paints his form,
    All over his body, he paints his form,
    With the dark clouds he paints his form,
    With the misty rain he paints his form,
    With the rainy bubbles he paints his form,
    To fingers and rattle he paints his form,
    To the plume on his head he paints his form.

    In the house made of the dark mist,
    In the house made of she-rain,
    In the house made of pollen,
    In the house made of grasshoppers,
    Where the dark mist curtains the doorway,
    The path to which is on the rainbow,
    Where the zigzag lightning stands high on top,

PRAYER OF THE FOSTER-PARENT CHANT (_Teton-Sioux_)

    Great Mystery, you have existed from the first;
    This sky and this earth you created.
    Wing flapper (Thunder Bird), you have existed from the first,
    Your nation is half soldiers and half chiefs, so they say.
    Lend me a good day; I borrow it.
    Me, the Indian race, you have uplifted.
    But now I am in despair;
    Yet this good boy will renew the life of his people.
    So, Great Mystery, look upon me; pity me,
    That the nation may live—
    Before the face of the North, the nation may live.


HOLY SONG (_Dakota_)

    O ye people, be ye healed;

    Bringing with you joy.

    Bringing with them joy;
    Nearer still they come—holy visions—
    Bringing with them joy.

III

    Holy visions!
    Lo! Before the doorway pause they, waiting,
    Bearing gifts of joy;
    Pausing there they wait—holy visions—
    Bearing gifts of joy.

IV

    Holy visions!
    Now they cross the threshold, gliding softly
    Toward the space within;
    Softly gliding on—holy visions—
    Toward the space within.

V

    Holy visions!
    They the lodge are filling with their presence,
    Fraught with hope and peace;
    Filling all the lodge—holy visions—

    Now they touch the children, gently touch them,
    Giving dreams of joy;
    Gently touch each one—holy visions—
    Giving dreams of joy.

VII

    Holy visions!
    Ended now their mission, pass they outward,
    Yet they leave us joy;
    Pass they all from us—holy visions—
    Yet they leave us joy.

VIII

    They, the sky ascending, reach their dwelling;
    There they rest above;
    They their dwelling reach—holy visions—
    There they rest above.


RITUAL SONG (_Pawnee_)

I

    I know not if the voice of man can reach to the sky;
    I know not if the mighty one will hear as I pray;
    I know not if the gifts I ask will all granted be;
    I know not if the word of old we truly can hear;
    I know not what will come to pass in our future days;
    I hope that only good will come, my children, to you.

II

    I now know that the voice of man can reach the sky;
    I now know that the mighty one has heard as I prayed;
    I now know that the gifts I asked have all granted been.
    I now know that the word of old we truly have heard;
    I now know that _Tirá wa_ hearkens unto man’s prayer;
    I know that only good has come, my children, to you.


MEDICINE SONG (_Omaha_)

    Ho! Aged One, _eçka_,
    At a time when there were gathered together seven persons,
    You sat in the seventh place, it is said,
    And of the Seven you alone possessed knowledge of all things,
    Aged One, _eçka_.
    When in their longing for protection and guidance,
    The people sought in their minds for a way,
    They beheld you sitting with assured permanency and endurance
    In the center where converged the paths,
    There, exposed to the violence of the four winds, you sat,
    Possessed with power to receive supplications,
    Aged One, _eçka_.
    Where is his mouth, by which there may be utterance of speech?
    Where is his heart, to which there may come knowledge and
      understanding?
    Where are his feet, whereby he may move from place to place?
    We question in wonder,
    Yet verily it is said you alone have power to receive supplications,
    Aged One, _eçka_.
    I have desired to go yet farther in the path of life with my little
      ones,
    Without pain, without sickness,
    Beyond the second, third, and fourth period of life’s pathway,

PART TWO

POETIC FORMS IN AMERICAN INDIAN LYRICS


POETIC FORMS IN AMERICAN INDIAN LYRICS

The true touchstone of primitive verse is familiarity with aboriginal
life and manners. Let the observer sit among the American Indians under a
starlit sky in the far spaces of the desert, or with his horizon bound by
native forests, where only blazed trails penetrate the shadows—wherever
these people sing, encircling a quiet fire. Not even the folk-songs of
the colored race on their native plantations convey the sense of detached
unreality that comes with hearing these evening songs of the red race.

When a thousand songs have beaten their way into his pulse, the
listener may hope to understand both the form and the spirit of this
verse. Only this certain recognition acquired by personal knowledge
can direct him to sound judgments of the current pseudo-Indian verse.
It is the only safe basis for comparison when studies lead far afield
into the song-literature of many tribes. Many of us, however, cannot
readily explore the remote places of aboriginal song. For such readers,
fortunately, there is an increasing number of printed studies and of
records gathered by our great museums.

Even after wide observation and the close study of years, many
questions will still remain to baffle us. To reconcile many apparent
inconsistencies of Indian lyric verse forms, we must first understand the
_thought-movement_ of this body of poetry before we approach the whole
subject of _thought-rhythm_, with the questions of _repetition_ and of
_stanzaic_ and _metrical structure_.

In the mood of the poet, to be sure, lies the chief influence which
shapes the poem and marks its larger formal characteristics of
thought-movement and rhythm. There are the graceful, lilting verses
that go swiftly to the golden melodies of some of the shorter lyrics,
as in the _Song of the Coyote and Locust_; others which move in slow
processional to stately chants, as in the odes of _The Night Chant_.

But the thought-movement is the more immediate influence upon the
structure of a poem. The pre-eminently characteristic movement of the
Indian lyric is recessional.[1] It perceptibly intensifies the haunting,
melancholy effect in which the lyric usually finds voice. The _motif_
appears at the opening of the song, with the emotional intensity or
emphasis gradually dying away toward the close. This movement commonly
occurs in the shorter songs which are entirely repeated several times.
This recessional movement is effective with its musical accompaniment,
repeating the melody in a descending scale, and ending on a low note.
Thus _pitch_ and _accent_, as well as varying _quantity_, mark the
repetitions and lessen their monotony.

As a modification of the recessional movement, there is the poem which
opens with the _motif_ and repeats it at regularly recurring points
throughout, concluding abruptly without the refrain. There are some
stanzaic units in this group. Whatever may be the gain in emphasis and
in organization, there is a distinct loss in atmosphere. This type is
interesting as a transitional stage.

The second type of thought-movement has influenced a third group of songs
which shows wide divergence from the first. In this last group the major
emphasis always opens and closes the song, though it recurs at intervals,
as at the opening or close of each stanza. This is the most finished
lyric in design, the most completely thought out, with stanzaic units
distinct. Mood and idea join to create a beautiful form.

To a less extent, the processional, or forward, thought-movement appears
in lyric form. It may progress toward an emotional climax at the end of
a song or a sequence. In the songs before sunrise, as the _Daylight Song_
in _The Hako_, the intensity increases toward the close as dawn appears.
The forward movement finds its most natural place in the ballads and in
those ritualistic poems which anticipate dramatic gesture or action. This
dramatic relationship, whether in formal ceremony or in vocational songs,
shapes the thought-movement in direct contrast to the characteristic
order.

There are other poems which carry the thought forward to the close,
rounding with an effective summary, sustaining the heightened interest,
yet showing the fine intellectual perception of form in relation
to thought which appears in _Mount Koonak: A Song of Arsut_. In
characteristics, this type approaches the lyric which Doctor Moulton has
classified as the _free sonnet_.

Whatever variations appear in the sequence of thought, it must be
remembered that the use of the recessional movement is a primary law of
Indian lyric art.

There is within the lyric a sense of symmetry, of poetic consistency,
which cannot be measured by Anglo-Saxon rules of prosody. The Indian
poet achieves this symmetry in structure by using varied patterns of
thought-rhythm; that is, by means of infinitely modified forms of
repetition which are as distinctively characteristic of his genius as
parallelism was of the ancient Hebrew or as the variations of rhyme and
of stanzaic pattern are of the English lyric genius of the last four
centuries. The subtle relationship of patterns of thought-rhythm to the
whole movement of a poem is often so fugitive as to escape analysis. One
origin of these patterns is the most obvious dramatic association which
may also determine the direction of the entire thought-movement. Although
the dramatic _motif_ shapes both aspects of thought, there is no apparent
connection between the progression of an idea and, let us say, the
alternating rhythm, except when the alternation becomes incremental. The
determining values of pitch and of melodic repetition are also important
external factors. Where these influences end, it is difficult to say.

So far as this study has proceeded, five characteristic patterns of
thought-rhythm appear in Indian lyric poetry. The iterative rhythm
appears in the simpler poems, of which the Navaho _Mountain Song_ and
_The Omaha Tribal Prayer_ are particularly fine in spirit. The iteration
is not always pleasing, sometimes beating with the steady monotony of
a kettle drum; but, contrary to reasonable supposition, it does not
necessarily indicate a dance song.

The alternating rhythm offers the Indian poet some æsthetic relief. It
creates a graceful lilt in his verse and often accompanies the quicker
movements. This is a universal pattern; but some _Katzina Songs_ of the
Hopi and songs of the Zuñi and Pima Indians have markedly achieved this
freedom of movement. The elasticity of this form provides an infinite
variety of uses, from carrying a pleasant refrain to providing a choric
response for the support of a dancing soloist. It has a place in the
vocational songs, as well as in the ritual songs of a tribe. There are
many variants which employ alternating patterns of thought at the opening
and close of a stanza, or with dramatic pose and gesture, as in the Zuñi
_Invocation to the Sun-God_, in singing which the Indian mother appeals
to the sun, moon, and stars to guide her sleeping infant. Mr. Troyer
marks the values of pitch as heightening the rhythmic movements of this
song.

Balanced forms of thought, that is, forms in parallel structure, do not
appear commonly. Perhaps it is more exact to recall that pure iteration
and alternation of thought approximate the effects which parallelism
may contribute, especially when the repetition is sung in a different
pitch from that of the key thought. The infrequent occurrence of sharp
contrasts of imagery, or antitheses of thought, may explain the rare
use of parallelism. The ancient lament of the Onondagas, preserved in
_The Iroquois Book of Rites_, remains one of the most beautifully wrought
poems of this type brought down to our time.

The interlacing design of thought is one of the most graceful as well
as one of the most difficult. This pattern shows skill and delicacy in
poetic construction, as the interlacing repetitions frequently carry
from one stanza to another, as from first to third and second to fourth,
found in _The Morning Star and the New Born Dawn_, from _The Hako_.
This device carries the thought forward. It is, therefore, definitely
related in purpose to the form which is universally the vehicle of the
ballad—incremental repetition. The Indian poet uses this form both for
narrative and for descriptive purposes. The Navaho _Song of the Horse_
shows a studied picture, framing each detail with repetitions; while the
same incremental use of repetition carries forward the narrative in the
_Navaho Rain Chant_.

There is a further structural use of these forms. If we can point to a
single prototype of the lyric stanza, we must find it in the unit of
thought-rhythm. As it assumed different aspects, enlarging itself with
repetitions, there appeared the first conscious step, the stanzaic germ
with varying possibilities of structure. This æsthetic origin of the
stanza appeared before the intellectual recognition of unity of thought.
In this song recorded by Miss Fletcher, there is a stanzaic germ of
typically primitive quality. It is lengthened, possibly, for singing.
The composer shaped three words into the form of a stanza by the use of
repetitions and the addition of vocables.

    _Noⁿ-we shka-dse, noⁿ-we shka-dse_;
        Ha-ha! e he tha, Ha-ha! we
            Ha-ha! e he tha.
        Ha-ha! e he tha tha. Ho-ga!
    _Noⁿ-we shka-dse, noⁿ-we shka-dse_;
        Ha-ha! e he tha.

In countless song-poems, however, the compactness of thought and swift
unity of impression have evolved stanzas with complex and studied
patterns of thought-rhythm.

Other distinct influences over the varying patterns of the stanza are
the mystic numbers and the dramatic element in the ceremonials, the
former more often determining the length of the stanzas and the number
of such divisions in a song. The ritualistic use of the numbers two,
three, four, five, six, seven, and occasionally of multiples of these
numbers, determines the number of stanzas and repetitions in ritualistic
songs. It is rather unusual to find distinct tribal preferences in the
number of song divisions; although the Taos Pueblo uses two parts and the
Blackfoot tribe often seven. Orientation to the world quarters has almost
universally established some use of four stanzas and four repetitions in
religious songs. Dramatic influence emphasizes the fourfold division,
especially in the ritual.

The length of the stanza at no point appears as fixed as the number of
stanzas and repetitions. The stanzaic pattern repeats itself exactly more
often in a ritual song than in a secular. Many of the odes have extremely
long stanzas, some units of thought reaching to one hundred lines, as the
_Prayer of the First Dancers_ in the Navaho _Night Chant_. The length of
the stanza in other songs may range from the distich to the sixteen line
unit, although little stanzas of three to six lines appear to be the most
pleasing to the Indian poet. The longer stanzas commonly employ preludes
and refrains and at times resort to repetition of matter.

The oral lyric makes certain special demands of the composer. There must
be devices for marking off the stanzas. In addition to certain formal
patterns of repetition, these devices include tag endings, such as
conclude the scenes in Elizabethan drama, endings with a sharp contrast
in pitch and care in enunciation. The drop in pitch appears at the
close of the unit of music corresponding to the unit of verse. There
may occur, also, a complete change of rhythm and a distinct change in
thought from stanza to stanza. Cycles of short songs, or song-sequences
with fixed repetitions in the ceremonials, give the effect of stanzaic
divisions. We must conclude that the lack of written or printed forms
appears no hindrance to the development of stanzaic patterns.

The question of rhyme schemes invites more attention than some other
markers of the stanza. It is, to be sure, a relatively unimportant
factor in Indian rhythms: although the wide use of assonance commonly
approximates rhyme, and elaborate schemes of repetition serve a like
purpose. Various schemes of rhyme are used in the songs of _The Night
Chant_, particularly in the internal and end rhymes. In the _Song of the
Meal Rubbing_[1] the second element in the internal rhyme scheme binds
the lines together:

    Bĭtsísi ...
    Estsanatléhisi ...
    Alkaíye ...
    Bikenagádbe ...
    Bitalataibe ...
    Bĭdatóʿbe ...
    Biselataíbe ...
    Bĭthadĭtínbe ...
    Bĭdetsébe ...
    Sána-nogaíbe ...
    Biké-hozóbe ...

A simpler and more characteristic internal rhyme scheme is found in the
_Prayer of the First Dancers_,[2] _aaa_ _bbb_, in lines 14 to 21:

    ... nĭkégo ...
    ... nĭsklégo ...
    ... niégo ...
    ... nitságo ...
    ... bininĭnlágo ...
    ... dahitágo ...

Two further illustrations show the Navaho command of end rhymes. In the
_Daylight Song_,[3] there is easy inversion of pattern, _abba_:

    ... dóla aní,
    ... bĭźa holó,
    ... bĭźa hozó,
    ... hwí he inlí.

In _Slayer of the Alien Gods_,[4] the rhyme _aaaaa_ achieves a definite
tone color, rounding with a full open syllable:

    ... sĭnĭsnlígo,
    ... hánatahasgo,
    ... nítatahasgo,
    ... ínatahasgo,
    ... nínatahasgo.

We must keep in mind that these uses of rhyme serve only a secondary
purpose in drawing together the elements of the pattern within the stanza.

The stanza of Indian verse, it readily appears, is flexible in form—both
in length of line and in length of thought-unit. The rapid tempo employs
a short line, as in this Maliseet _Dance-Song_:[1]

    Kive-hiu-wha-ni-ho
        Ya hi ye
    Kive-hiu-wha-ni-yo
        Ya hi ye
        Ya hi ye
    Kshi-te-ka-mo-tikʹlo
        Ya hi ye
        Ya hi ye
      Pilsh-kwe-sis-tokʹlo
          Ya hi ye
      Kshi-te-ka-mo-tikʹlo
          Ya hi ye
      Twa, twa, twa, twa!

The short line does not merely accompany rapid movement. It appears a
measure of severe economy in some prayers in which the Indian catalogs
his daily needs for seventy or more lines! The formal invocations,
however, commonly use the longer line and the slower movement. Long,
slow, even lines breathe the lament of the _Death of Taluta_ and the
reflective cadences of _Mount Koonak: A Song of Arsut_.

The variation of the lyric line shows technical skill. The _Dance-Song_
just quoted beats out only a simple alteration of long and short lines.
_The Song of the Coyote and the Locust_ begins with long flowing lines,
but snaps off with a gay quick ending:

    Tchumali, tchumali, shohkoya,
    Tchumali, tchumali, shohkoya,
    Yaamii heeshoo taatani tchupatchiute
                Shohkoya,
                Shohkoya!

When the shorter line falls within the stanza, there is greater play of
mood and thought, with the elasticity of the outward swing and return in
the rhythm of the thought as we feel it through the succession of stanzas
in _The Song of the Rain Chant_. The line of verse sweeps outward and the
thought recedes at the ebb, as clearly as a _Hiroshige_ wave crest lifts
and the waters return to their level.

Within the silhouette of the verse are indisputable metrical patterns,
some structural, some decorative. These patterns frequently occur in
phrases; and these phrases, in turn, fall into a larger pattern which may
be repeated or may be interchanged with other patterns of corresponding
values. They are sometimes of amazing complexity, yet form a compact
unity of design.

Few correspondences appear in the versification of the white race; but
the Indians’ use of pitch[1] for marking off rhythmic units is similar
to such a use in Chinese poetry. For analysis, we must observe native
singers and study phonographic records. The printed verse gives little
opportunity for the study of meter except through musical accompaniment,
when the phrases of the music and of the verse coincide, as few notable
investigators have set down accent and quantity. Only phonographic
records show the use of pitch in rhythm, an element most familiar to
any one who has ever heard the Indians chant and sing. Two related arts
explain the unique character of Indian lyric measures, the musical
setting and the oral rendition of the poem.

Miss Natalie Curtis once asked an Indian singer, “Which came first, the
words or the music?”

“They came at the same moment,” he answered.

We must accept that explanation for the choicest lyrics: yet we cannot,
in that way, account for some performances of remarkable ingenuity.
A singer with the art of a counterpuntist may subordinate the iambic
word-rhythm of his poem to an alternating three-four and two-four rhythm
of the melody, while he dances at the same moment to the unaccented
rhythm of the drum. The whole question turns again in his next song in
which he faithfully sets the lilt of his verse to the corresponding
rhythm of the music. Any first hand comparison of the word-rhythm and the
melodic rhythm proceeds with the greatest difficulty. Since the Indian
invariably sings the lyrics, often many times, before dictating the
words, he tends to employ the melodic rhythm in speaking the lines.

It is possible, of course, that the shifting of natural speech stresses
to adapt the verse to the music marks the distinct composition of words
and of music, with the latter as the earlier effort. There can be no
doubt that, in aboriginal life, music is more generally persistent than
words, and that new verses sometimes replace forgotten songs. On the
other hand, it is equally certain that many of these misfit songs are
only inferior compositions, hobbling in their meter just as the white
poet’s lyrics at times go haltingly in their rhythm.

Whether the Indian poet composed his lyric and melody simultaneously or
composed the verse to the rhythm of the melody, he conceived his song as
an oral expression which should set free his mood through an interpretive
accompaniment. That some melodies have changed their verbal associations
in the history of centuries may indicate that new experiences have
informed their characteristic rhythms. If the original words have been
lost, it is entirely possible that the new poem is perfectly adjusted
to the music as a genuine re-expression of the rhythm and sweep of the
melody. We have a notable instance in English in the poetry of Burns.

Indian lyric poetry has, we have noted, the qualities of oral verse.
It employs a number of devices to mark off rhythmic units: stress,
accent, range in pitch, quantity, and effort in enunciation. Stress
and the higher pitch coincide almost universally. The dramatic and the
musical influence require some use of quantity. Aside from its main use
in the tag ending of verse or stanza when stress is not used for that
purpose, effort in enunciation appears to be an accidental rhythmic
element, depending upon the use of the high, close vowels, as _e_, and
the aspirated, closed, and guttural consonants. It is, therefore, least
useful when it coincides with the other devices of rhythm—lost, as it
must be, in the use of stress. Indian poetry makes a sharp distinction,
it must be observed, between accent and stress, the latter requiring
definite bodily effort, even explosive enunciation.

The oral rendition of a poem brings us to some unexpected turns in
versification. A scholar observes that one must have an Indian throat to
sing these songs. This physical control is two fold: unique control of
the breathing and contraction or pulsation of the glottis, especially in
measures of unusual length. In Indian verse, there is a lengthening of
the metrical unit beyond the ordinary limits of European verse in feet of
six, seven, eight, and nine syllables, with but one syllable prominent
in stress, pitch, or quantity. The Indian sings and speaks on for hours
without apparent weariness.

The elemental two and three syllabled feet appear universally in Indian
poetry, but commonly in phrases with the longer feet of five to nine
syllables, as in the _Pledge Song_ of the Chippewa: _nín-da-ca-mi-gog_ |
_éya_. Another pattern has the recurring metrical phrase of three, six,
and five syllables: _í e ba_ | _bá-pi-ni-si-wa-gûn_ | _gé-non-de-ci-nan_.
A rhythmic group of five and one may be varied by the substitution of a
three syllabled and a two syllabled measure for that of five syllables.
A song may carry a two syllabled rhythm consistently, even when all
repetitions of line are disregarded:

    O-kú-wah-tsá, úm weh dah án,
    Hang wén bo wú u wán moon pí,
    Han wán bo hí wut di ún wéh dah án,
    É yan ne _yá_ ah né yáh na án.
    Ah é yan ne yáh ah né yáh na án.

A Papago harvest song, for instance, balances high and low pitched
measures in rising three syllabled rhythm, which suggests a dance with
gesture or swaying of the body. In each phrase of the song, the foot
of the higher pitch carries the heavier stress. This double use of
pitch and stress, or accent, in phrases of two measures runs throughout
the song, showing the regularity of metrical pattern to be expected
where the lyric accompanies action or ritual observance. Such definite
schemes of short measures do not appear as commonly as in English lyric
poetry. In many Indian lyrics there is a tendency to avoid such emphatic
rhythms—a tendency toward the free rhythms, though the sense of measure
is never lost. On the whole, Indian lyric poetry is highly rhythmical in
structure, although not closely metrical.

The most interesting metrical patterns are the long units which almost
escape the ear as they die away in the low pitched glottal vibrations
of a glide. In these measures, liquid consonants frequently combine
with open vowels; though a Chippewa singer may take _b_, _t_, _g_,
and _k_ in one long unit. The singer finds the feet of eight and nine
syllables easiest when they are made up of vocables or of elongations of
a syllable, as _e-ye-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-_, receding in delicate sound waves
and requiring no effort in enunciation. These sound waves may occur as
a scarcely perceptible double pulsation within the long unit, in such
syllables as _e-ya_, _ai-ya_, which require little articulation. The poet
can sing them indefinitely, as they fall into the rhythm of respiration.
This syllabic group is the irreducible unit within the foot; if we
eliminate the lengthening of a vowel, a device for the singer rather than
for the poet.

The function of the vocable in the metrical design is nonessential from
the intellectual viewpoint; but there is a clear value, from an æsthetic
viewpoint, in the full rounded vowels of many syllables. They give tone
color to the whole song, and enrich the metrical design.

The range in metrical patterns gives infinite variety and freedom to
Indian verse. The poet varies even his repetition of rhythmic phrases
by using different degrees of pitch. By far the most notable element
in Indian versification, in fact, is this art of combining dissimilar
rhythms and of playing one against another with the effect of many
instruments.

All the subtlety of charm and melody in the verse evades analysis in the
study of rhythms; yet poetry is no less beautiful because we catch the
grace of a flowing line and the play of assonance through open syllables,
as in the Zuñi _Sunset Song_; the contrasting gaiety of light, quick,
staccato movement; or the faultless symmetry of antiphonals. It is
extremely difficult to interpret in terms of occidental prosody the
poetic genius which arose from an alien civilization. We must constantly
return to our cultural backgrounds for explanation.

It is not an incidental play-motif that the Zuñi children sing in the
_Hymn to the Sun_, “Listen, just listen,” as they hold spiral shells to
their ears. Mr. Troyer wrote: “The primary aim seems to be to develop
early in life, by mechanical aids, the perception of solar vibration,
which later in life becomes a natural gift.” A critic whose hearing is
less sensitive than that of the Red Man will remain wholly unaware of
many delicate nuances.

These subtle changes in Indian lyrics can scarcely be said to follow
metrical laws, yet cannot be thought accidental. The shifting influence
of pause is negligible. There is slight use of quantity except in vocalic
and consonantal interplay, and that is most elusive. Subtleties of mood
and thought in the line may turn swiftly from the flowing movement to
the staccato with corresponding shift in measure. A distinct influence
appears in the cluster-rhythms of holophrastic compounds. This element
becomes especially noticeable when the singer pauses to dictate the words
of his song. The crest words or syllables in a line, particularly in the
recessional movement and in descending pitch, may also shift the metrical
emphasis. In the Zuñi song _Lover’s Wooing_, the crest words are most
distinct: blanket, maiden, awaiting, alone, walk, come. The rhythm bends
to them.

To one who has listened to countless Indian songs, there remains another
logical influence over the exquisite variations of these lyrics—mimesis
of elements of the natural world. The rhythms of nature float through the
rhythms of Indian verse. The winds are imitated in the oral rendition
of many poems: the minor key, the little rushes of wind, the full swell
of sound, the gradual dying away. Curiously enough, the Plains tribes
call their songs in recollection of the absent “wind songs,” in true
appreciation of their minor key.

The steady patter or downfall of rain sings a welcome rhythm to the
Indian of the plains and of the southwest. There is an insistence in the
rhythm of many rain-songs that is mimetic, not only in the total effect
of rain but distinctly so in the character of metrical units. “I like
those songs,” an old man once said to me quite simply, his face quickened
with a smile. His songs had just measured the summer rain, then dropped
away through gliding syllables to a whispering echo—the wind and the
rain!

It is the natural, joyous response of the Red Man to his surroundings
that catches up these free rhythms of the out-door world and shapes his
gesture and thought in measure with them in his improvisations. In the
subtlety of its rhythms, Indian lyric poetry cannot detach itself from
these external influences; for no race of the modern world lives more
intimately with nature, sensing its most delicate expressions, its most
exquisite sounds and movements.

These natural rhythms, though constantly recurring, may appear largely
incidental; yet there are elemental laws at work determining lyric
rhythms, laws we must seek behind the poetic impulse. One law is that
poetic art, as all other arts, shall be rooted fast in the physical
surroundings which temper the race. Any effort to wrest an art from that
traditional environment breaks it off at the tap root.

sang as above.”

73. _Ibid._, pp. 331-333. The vivid imagery of the original is lost in
the translation. Compare the phrases from the free translation with the
more literal rendering:

    “Darkness of evening falls” and
    “Blue evening drops”;

    “The white light of day dawn

    “The white dawn rises.”

In stanzas III and IV, when the phrase _Hitciya yahina-a_ stands alone as
a line, it has been inserted. It appears in the original, but was omitted
by Mr. Russell in his translation. In fact, it concludes every sentence
in the song. Observe that the introductory phrase is the same for each
stanza. Mr. Russell does not use the full repetition of the original.

This song-sequence begins with the death of Mah-oh-rah. Seeking to bring
her back from the spirit world, her father rides in pursuit across the
sky. The Grandmother, guardian deity of the Wyandots, transforms the
flying group into stars, Dehn-dek’s three stags becoming the stars in the
Belt of Orion.

Line 5. The spirit world.

Line 6. _Our Grandmother_ was the daughter of the Mighty Ruler of Heaven.
The Creation myth relates her accidental fall from heaven, her rescue
by the Swans, and the creation of the Great Island (North America) for
her home. In her subterranean city, she ruled over the Wyandots with her
fiery torch given by the Thunder God. After the Wyandots came out to live
on the earth, their spirits visited her on their way to the Land of the
Little People.

“On their emergence upon the surface of the earth, the Nether-World
people danced together and with Elder Brother sang this song.” Since this
is an archaic song, with its theme of the beginning of the race, we may
consider it, in the original, an example of the earlier rhythms.

98. _Ibid._, p. 274.

The last four words are added, in Mr. Russell’s own words, to show that
the original song closes with a repetition of its opening. The complete
version, in seventeen lines, uses the opening group three times. This
song is archaic; and its rhythm is undoubtedly one of the earlier types.

*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK AMERICAN INDIAN LOVE LYRICS, AND OTHER VERSE, FROM THE SONGS OF THE NORTH AMERICAN INDIANS ***


    

Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.


START: FULL LICENSE

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily

same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at www.gutenberg.org. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:

    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    
    • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

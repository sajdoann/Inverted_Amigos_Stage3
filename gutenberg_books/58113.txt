GEORGII IV. Regis.


_Cap._ cviii.


An Act to provide for the paving, gravelling, lighting, and watching
certain Footways and Carriageways in and near _Brompton Square_ in the
Parish of _Saint Mary Abbotts Kensington_ in the County of _Middlesex_;
and to provide for the Maintenance of a Garden and Shrubbery in the said

WHEREAS _William Farlar_ of _Brompton_ in the County of _Middlesex_,
Esquire, claims to be seised of a Piece of Freehold Land at _Brompton_,

_Middlesex_, which abuts South on the Turnpike Road from _Knightsbridge_
to _Fulham_, West on Land belonging to the Trustees of _Saint George’s_
Hospital, North on Land now or lately belonging to the Heirs of the late
Duke of _Kingston_, and East on Ground now or lately belonging to _Elisha
Biscoe_, and a Road leading to _Brompton_ Chapel: And whereas a Square
called _Brompton Square_, and also divers Streets and public Places, have
in part been laid out and formed, and are intended to be speedily
completed on the said Piece of Land; and it would be beneficial to the
Owners and Occupiers of Houses in the said Square, Streets, and public
Places, and also be of public Advantage, to provide by Law for the
paving, gravelling, watering, lighting, and watching of the said Square,
Streets, and public Places, and for the Maintenance of a Pleasure Garden
in the said Square: May it therefore please Your Majesty that it may be
enacted; and be it enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and
with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and
Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of
the same, That the Limits of this Act shall for all the Purposes thereof
be deemed and taken to comprize all the Land of which the said _William
Farlar_ claims to be seised as aforesaid, and all Messuages, Erections,
and Buildings thereon.

II.  And be it further enacted, That every Person who now is or for the
Time being shall be in his own Right or in the Right of his Wife in the
actual Possession, or in the Receipt of the Rents and Profits of a
Dwelling House or other Tenement within the Limits of this Act, of the
clear yearly Value of Forty Pounds above Reprisals, and also every Person
who now is, or, for the Time being, shall be, actually and _bonâ fide_ an
Occupier of a Dwelling House rated or liable to be rated by virtue or for
the Purposes of this Act, shall be and they respectively are hereby
constituted Trustees for putting this Act into Execution, and the said

III.  Provided always, and be it further enacted, That no Person shall be
capable of acting as a Trustee in the Execution of this Act, except in

and subscribed an Oath to the Effect following: that is to say,

    ‘I — — do swear, That I truly and bonâ fide am in my own Right [or in

    clear yearly Value of Forty Pounds above Reprises [or that I am an
    Occupier of a Dwelling House rated or liable to be rated by virtue
    and for the Purposes and] within the Limits of an Act of the Fifth

                                                         ‘So help me GOD.’

And if any Person not being qualified as aforesaid, or not having taken

which are hereby authorized or directed to be made, done, or executed by

Trustees present at the respective Meetings to be held pursuant to this
Act (the whole Number present not being less than Five), and all such
Acts, Orders, and Proceedings shall have the same Force and Effect as if
the same were made, done, or executed by or before all the Trustees; and
no Order or Determination made, agreed upon, or entered into at any
Meeting of the said Trustees shall be revoked or altered at any

Persons respectively shall, at such Times and in such Manner as shall be
directed by the said Trustees, deliver to the said Trustees, or to such
Person or Persons as they shall nominate, true and perfect Accounts in

Person shall refuse or neglect to deliver to the said Trustees, or to
such Person or Persons as they shall nominate, such an Account as
aforesaid, or to deliver up the Vouchers relating to the same, or to make
Payment as aforesaid, or if any such Officer or Person shall not deliver

Gas the said Water shall be so contaminated as aforesaid, which Costs and

contained in this Act may be recovered before a Justice of the Peace:
Provided always, that if upon such Examination it shall appear that such
Contamination has not arisen from any such Escape of Gas from any of the
Mains, Pipes, or Conduits of the said Trustees, Gas Light Company, or

    Day and Year first above written.’

XL.  And be it further enacted, That where any Distress shall be made for

computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
